
[00:04.13]歌名:No Apologies
[00:05.72]歌手:Eminem
[00:07.08]
[00:20.17]In my mind I'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter
[00:22.84]My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
[00:24.07]An arsenic writer, author with arthritis
[00:27.48]Carpal tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
[00:30.36]Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
[00:32.79]Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache - I'm sick
[00:35.65]Quick-witted, for every lyric spitted,
[00:38.07]There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
[00:40.45]So quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
[00:43.13]It's gonna explode any minute - some lunatic lit it,
[00:45.37]And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
[00:47.83]When I stop selling I'll quit so, stop dwelling
[00:50.50]I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready,
[00:53.12]'Cause I got jelly like (Beyonce's) pot belly
[00:55.66]This is destiny, yes money, I'm off running
[00:58.39]So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening
[00:59.27]
[01:00.40]Chorus:
[01:00.67]
[01:00.96]No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
[01:02.95]You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
[01:05.74]No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
[01:08.59]No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
[01:10.88]No apologies, I'm not even acknowledging you at all
[01:14.08]'till I get a call that God's coming
[01:16.12]No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
[01:18.66]I could spit in your face while you're standing across from me
[01:21.04]No apologies
[01:21.56]
[01:22.05]Verse 2:
[01:22.30]
[01:22.65]My head hits the pillow, a weepin' willow
[01:23.68]I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
[01:25.46]But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
[01:28.58]Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
[01:31.39]I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
[01:33.66]These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
[01:36.55]I keep sayin' it - I cant stress it enough
[01:39.08]So keep playin' it and stand next to the subs
[01:41.62]I choke mics like asphyxiation,
[01:43.88]While I'm strangling my own throat masturbatin' (haha)
[01:46.60]Fuck yeah, I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit,
[01:50.14]'till my ass gets wasted, 'till my assassination,
[01:54.09]'till I'm slain cause of some fag's infatuation
[01:57.16]44 mag - a fascination, a taste for disaster
[02:00.34]And if that's the case then..
[02:01.15]
[02:01.45]Chorus:
[02:01.72]
[02:02.10]No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
[02:04.33]You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
[02:06.67]No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
[02:09.38]No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
[02:11.77]No apologies, I'm not even acknowledging you at all,
[02:14.44]'till I get a call that God's coming
[02:17.71]No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
[02:19.73]I could spit in your face while your standing across from me
[02:21.90]No apologies
[02:22.23]
[02:22.42]Verse 3:
[02:23.22]
[02:23.69]This song isn't for you it's for me - A true mc
[02:25.83]It's what he'll do just to see if he still has it
[02:28.32]And if his skills mastered,
[02:29.76]He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a real MC,
[02:32.26]Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
[02:36.91]You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me,
[02:40.22]Then expect a longer life expectancy
[02:42.80]I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me,
[02:47.34]Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self-loathing and mourning
[02:50.99]So I’m warning you, don’t coax me
[02:52.91]Its silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
[02:55.25]Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled,
[02:58.95]The press blows up this whole thing - it's stupid,
[03:01.28]They don't know cause they don't see that I'm wounded
[03:03.93]All they did was ballooned it,
[03:05.66]I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
[03:08.11]That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
[03:10.20]And they can suck my dick while I'm pukin',
[03:12.13]And you too you can..
[03:13.42]Outro:
[03:13.93]
[03:14.16]..Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an mc
[03:17.78]This is how I'm supposed to be
[03:18.34]Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
[03:21.13]So expect no apologies
[03:22.49]
[03:24.05].Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an mc
[03:26.43]This is how I'm supposed to be
[03:28.10]Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
[03:31.22]So expect no apologies
[03:33.71]......end.
