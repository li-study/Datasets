[00:15.28]It’s 2:11 and I’m stressing
[00:17.33]Watching Tv in my hotel suite
[00:22.88]I check my service every second
[00:24.92]At 2:10 you still hadn’t called me
[00:30.46]So I’m gonna leave my cell phone
[00:32.35]Turned on in my purse by the bed
[00:38.04]And before I fall asleep
[00:39.61]I guess I’ll just check my machine
[00:41.52]Again and again because I’m
[00:44.53]Obsessing on you
[00:47.56]I wanna be your babydoll
[00:54.26]Wrap me up nice and tight
[00:58.17]Love me through the night
[01:02.82]Come lay me down
[01:05.08]Enfold me in your arms
[01:09.37]Cover me with velvet kisses
[01:11.29]Rock me on and on
[01:13.08]And whisper softly to me
[01:14.97]You wanna be my babydoll
[01:20.79]Zoning out thinking about
[01:22.67]You and me between the sheets
[01:28.28]I want to get intimate
[01:30.20]But you’re not within my reach
[01:35.84]So I’ll have a little more wine
[01:37.71]And I’ll try to drink you
[01:38.68]Out of my head
[01:42.97]And I’ll lay awake awhile
[01:44.98]’Til I’m high enough I can
[01:46.73]Forget about you until
[01:49.16]I wake up again
[01:52.27]I wanna be your babydoll
[01:58.85]Wrap me up nice and tight
[02:02.67]Love me through the night
[02:07.30]Come lay me down
[02:09.79]Enfold me in your arms
[02:14.14]Cover me with velvet kisses
[02:16.04]Rock me on and on
[02:17.64]And whisper softly to me
[02:19.64]You wanna be my babydoll
[02:25.51]Slipping into dreams
[02:28.96]I feel my love surround you
[02:33.10]Ny subconscious seems
[02:36.58]To weave itself around you
[02:40.73]Do you care for me
[02:44.44]Beyond idolization
[02:48.55]Tell me how you feel
[02:51.86]But don’t keep me at bay
[02:53.99]’Cause I won’t be waiting long
[02:57.10]I wanna be your babydoll
[03:03.73]Wrap me up nice and tight
[03:07.39]Love me through the night
[03:12.04]Come lay me down
[03:14.64]Enfold me in your arms
[03:19.01]Cover me with velvet kisses
[03:20.35]Rock me on and on
[03:22.78]And whisper softly to me
[03:24.92]You wanna be my babydoll
[03:28.13]I wanna be your babydoll
[03:34.45]Wrap me up nice and tight
[03:38.28]Love me through the night
[03:43.08]Come lay me down
[03:45.38]Enfold me in your arms
[03:49.72]Cover me with velvet kisses
[03:51.76]Rock me on and on
[03:53.23]And whisper softly to me
[03:55.28]You wanna be my babydoll
