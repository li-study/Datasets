[00:10.00]Vanessa Williams
[00:12.00]
[00:13.00]You and I in this moment
[00:20.00]Holding the night so close
[00:27.00]Hanging on, still unbroken
[00:33.00]While outside the thunder rolls
[00:40.00]Listen now, you can hear our heartbeat
[00:48.00]Warm against life's bitter cold
[00:52.00]These are the days
[00:56.00]The sweetest days we'll know
[01:05.00]
[01:15.00]There are times that scare me
[01:21.00]We rattle the house like the wind
[01:28.00]Both of us so unbending
[01:35.00]We battle the fear within
[01:41.00]All the while, life is rushing by us
[01:49.00]Hold it now and don't let go
[01:58.00]The sweetest days we'll know
[02:07.00]
[02:09.00]So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
[02:16.83]Watching the stars till they're gone
[02:23.00]And when even the memories have all faded away
[02:30.32]These days go on and on
[02:37.00]Listen now, you can hear our heartbeats
[02:44.00]Hold me now and don't let go
[02:49.00]These are the days
[02:52.00]Everydays the sweetest days we'll know
[02:59.27][01:54.00]These are the days
[03:04.00]The sweetest days we'll know
[03:15.00]
