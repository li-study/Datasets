[00:07.50]第一次弄歌词，遇到好多麻烦~~~
[00:09.50]
[00:15.26]Spotlight shining brightly, on my face
[00:27.52]I can't see a thing and yet I feel you walking my way
[00:39.91]Empty stage, with nothing but discourage
[00:52.15]Singing this simple melody and
[00:57.46]wearing her heart on her sleave and right now
[01:05.17]I have you, for a moment I can tell I've got you
[01:17.34]Cuz your lips don't move
[01:21.30]Something is happening
[01:24.37]Cuz your eyes tell me the truth
[01:30.80]I've put a spell over you
[01:49.31]Beauty emanates from every word that you say
[02:01.56]You've captured the deepest thoughts
[02:04.84]in the purest, and simplest of ways
[02:11.92]But you see, I'm not that graceful, Like you
[02:20.43]Nor am I as eloquent
[02:26.56]But just a simple melody
[02:31.50]can change the way that you see me
[02:36.43]and right now, I have you
[02:46.05]for a moment I can tell I've got you
[02:49.30]Cuz your lips don't move
[02:55.81]and something is happening
[02:58.98]Cuz your eyes tell me the truth
[03:05.35]I've put a spell over you
[03:23.96]And all my life I've stumbled
[03:28.71]But up here I am just perfect
[03:36.95]Perfect as I'll, ever be
[03:46.98]I have you, for a moment
[03:58.75]I can tell I've got you
[04:01.60]Cuz your lips don't move
[04:04.51]and something is happening
[04:08.56]Cuz your eyes tell me the truth
[04:14.76]I've put a spell over you
