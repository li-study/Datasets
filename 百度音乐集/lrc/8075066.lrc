[00:16.47]The moon is full my arms are empty
[00:23.43]All night long I've pleaded and cried
[00:31.31]You always said the day that you would leave me
[00:38.01]Would be a cold day in July
[00:48.07]Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
[00:54.65]I guess we said everything with good-bye
[01:02.85]Time moves so slow and promises get broken
[01:10.38]On this cold day in July
[01:19.24]Sun's coming up coming up down on Main Street
[01:26.13]Children shout as they're running out to play
[01:33.51]Head in my hands here I am
[01:37.09]Standing in my bare feet
[01:41.00]Watching you drive away
[01:44.86]Watching you drive away
[01:51.43]You said that we were gonna last forever
[01:58.23]You said our love would never die
[02:05.93]It looks like spring and
[02:08.59]It feels like sunny weather
[02:13.51]But it's a cold day in July
[02:20.47]Sun's coming up coming up down on Main Street
[02:29.45]Children shout as they're running out to play
[02:36.74]Head in my hands here I am
[02:40.08]Standing in my bare feet
[02:44.06]Watching you drive away
[02:47.80]Watching you drive away
[02:54.41]The moon is full my arms are empty
[03:01.02]All night long how I've pleaded and cried
[03:08.92]You always said the day that you would leave me
[03:16.33]Would be a cold day in July
