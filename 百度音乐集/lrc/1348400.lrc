[00:16.91]Leaves are falling down
[00:18.20]On the beautiful ground
[00:19.83]I heard a story from the man in red
[00:23.06]He said the leaves are falling down
[00:25.16]Such a beautiful sound so I think you
[00:26.64]Son, I think you better go ahead
[00:29.70]
[00:29.90]But you always hold your head up high
[00:33.39]Cause it's a long, long, long way down
[00:36.20]This town was meant for passing through
[00:38.67]But it ain't nothing new
[00:40.17]Now go and show them
[00:41.25]That the world stayed round
[00:43.67]But it's a long, long, long way down
[00:52.91]
[00:57.36]You better run for the hills before they burn
[01:00.15]Listen to the sound of the world
[01:01.81]And watch it turn
[01:02.92]I just want to show you what I know
[01:06.32]And catch you when the current lets you go
[01:09.72]Or should I just get along with myself
[01:12.96]
[01:13.33]I never did get along with everybody else
[01:16.96]I've been trying hard to do what's right
[01:20.35]But you know I could stay here all night
[01:25.37]And watch the clouds fall from the sky
[01:29.21]
[01:29.53]This river is wild
[01:36.77]This river is wild
[01:39.81]
[01:45.41]Run for the hills before they burn
[01:48.08]Listen to the sound of the world
[01:50.33]Watch it turn
[01:51.49]But shake a little
[01:52.70]Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk
[01:54.89]I shake a little
[01:55.86]Sometimes i hate the line I walk
[01:58.41]I just want to show you what I know
[02:01.77]And catch you when the current lets you go
[02:04.97]
[02:05.11]Or should I just get along with myself
[02:08.77]I never did get along with everybody else
[02:12.34]Ive been trying hard to do whats right
[02:15.88]But you know I could stay here all night
[02:21.07]And watch the clouds fall
[02:22.81]From the sky
[02:24.43]
[02:26.12]Because this river is wild
[02:29.45]God speed you boy
[02:32.96]This river is wild
[02:36.56]
[02:39.10]Now Adam's taking bombs
[02:40.47]And he's stuck on his mom
[02:41.85]Because that bitch
[02:42.94]Keeps trying to make him pray
[02:45.18]
[02:45.41]He's with the hippie in the park
[02:47.30]Coming over the dark
[02:48.79]Just trying to get some of that little girl play
[02:51.99]
[02:52.16]You better run for the hills before they burn
[02:55.28]Listen to the sound of the world
[02:57.60]But watch it turn
[02:58.77]I just want to show you what I know
[03:01.92]And catch you when the current lets you go
[03:05.22]
[03:05.46]Or should I get along with myself
[03:08.76]I never did get along with everybody else
[03:12.37]I've been trying hard to do whats right
[03:15.81]But you know I could stay here all night
[03:20.18]And watch the clouds fall from the sky
[03:25.06]
[03:27.49]And pay this hell in me tonight
[03:32.11]Because this river is wild
[03:34.86]God speed you boy
[03:40.08]This river is wild
[03:46.60]This river is wild
[03:49.62]God speed you boy
[03:53.00]This river is wild
[03:56.69]
[03:59.18]Now the cards are everywhere face in dust
[04:02.68]The fairground
[04:05.81]I don't think I ever seen so many headlights
[04:11.08]But there's something pulling me
[04:16.09]The circus and the crew
[04:18.32]Well they're just passing through
[04:20.93]Making sure the merry still goes round
[04:26.77]But it's a long, long, long way down
