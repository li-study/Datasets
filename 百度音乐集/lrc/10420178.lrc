[00:12.75]
[00:13.27]Broke my heart
[00:14.86]Down the road
[00:16.76]Spend the weekend
[00:21.04]Sewing the pieces back on
[00:23.22]
[00:23.54]Crayons and dolls pass me by (?)
[00:28.33]Walking gets too boring
[00:31.65]When you learn how to fly
[00:33.73]
[00:33.96]Not the homecoming kind
[00:38.10]Take the top off
[00:41.97]And who knows what you might find
[00:44.52]
[00:45.05]Won't confess all my sins
[00:48.34]You can bet I'll try it
[00:52.01]But I can't always win
[00:53.91]
[00:54.73]'Cause I'm a gypsy
[00:55.33]But are you coming with me?
[00:58.08]I might steal your clothes
[01:01.07]And wear them if they fit me
[01:03.46]I never made agreements
[01:06.25]Just like a gypsy
[01:08.83]And I won't back down
[01:11.54]'Cause life's already hurt me
[01:14.08]And I won't cry
[01:16.28]I'm too young to die
[01:17.75]If you're gonna quit me
[01:19.41]'Cause I'm a gypsy
[01:21.76]
[01:23.06]('Cause I'm a gypsy)
[01:26.63]
[01:30.86]I can't hide
[01:33.17]what I've done
[01:34.85]Scars remind me
[01:38.85]Of just how far that I've come
[01:41.32]To whom it may concern
[01:45.33]Only run with scissors
[01:48.95]When you want to get hurt
[01:50.50]
[01:51.09]''Cause I'm a gypsy
[01:52.93]But are you coming with me?
[01:55.39]I might steal your clothes
[01:57.72]And wear them if they fit me
[02:00.60]I never made agreements
[02:03.10]Just like a gypsy
[02:05.62]And I won't back down
[02:08.41]'Cause life's already hurt me
[02:10.70]And I won't cry
[02:12.92]I'm too young to die
[02:13.44]If you're gonna quit me
[02:15.14]'Cause I'm a gypsy
[02:17.54]
[02:20.11]I said hey you
[02:22.10]You're no fool
[02:22.62]If you say 'NO'
[02:24.24]Ain't it just the way life goes?
[02:26.67]People fear what they don't know
[02:29.09]Come along for the ride (Oh yeah)
[02:33.42]Come along for the ride (ooohhh)
[02:38.19]
[02:38.59]'Cause I'm a gypsy
[02:41.46]But are you coming with me?
[02:44.32]I might steal your clothes
