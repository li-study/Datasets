[03:00.20][00:14.27]She's walking there alone,
[03:03.51][00:18.07]No one by her side
[03:08.47][00:23.00]She manages to fight the tears,
[03:12.72][00:27.21]But The pain inside
[03:15.00][00:29.81]She can't hide
[00:33.35]And all the tears she's cried
[00:40.37]The moment she closes her eyes,
[00:45.25]She starts thinking of you
[00:50.28]The dreams that she had one time
[00:54.20]Have gone away
[00:57.00]Will they ever come true?
[01:01.28]All she needs is…

[01:14.00][03:39.00][03:20.61][02:13.12]And she wishes today

[03:44.00][03:26.05][02:17.87][01:19.58]When you cared so much for her
[03:46.35][03:28.00][02:20.41][01:21.11]And loved her so
[02:22.00][01:23.56][03:48.25][03:30.00]Not a doubt in her mind
[02:24.35][01:27.88][03:50.22][03:32.33]That it would still be you
[01:28.76][03:35.34][03:52.46][02:26.36]Cause the love that you shared…
[03:36.34][01:30.73][03:55.53][02:29.09]It was true
[04:07.72][02:50.27](music...)
[01:43.11]You never thought about it,
[01:47.00]What you made her feel
[01:52.00]You promised you'd stay together,
[01:54.90]But the hope she once had…
[01:58.00]So unreal
[02:02.68]All she needs is…
[02:08.00][02:05.00]All she needs is you
