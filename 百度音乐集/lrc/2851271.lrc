[00:07.94]La isla bonita
[00:11.23]Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
[00:16.68]Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
[00:20.83]A young girl with eyes like the desert
[00:26.14]It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[00:31.73]Tropical the island breeze
[00:33.15]All of nature, wild and free
[00:35.28]This is where I long to be
[00:37.65]La isla bonita
[00:40.43]And when the samba played
[00:42.42]The sun would set so high
[00:45.04]Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[00:47.10]You Spanish lullaby
[00:59.27]I fell in love with San Pedro
[01:04.56]Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
[01:14.19]I prayed taht the days would last
[01:17.80]They went so fast
[01:18.71]Tropical the island breeze
[01:20.79]All of nature, wild and free
[01:23.32]This is where I long to be
[01:25.62]La isla bonita
[01:28.36]And when the samba played
[01:30.46]The sun would set so high
[01:33.02]Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[01:35.07]You Spanish lullaby
[01:47.55]I want to be where the sun warms the sky
[01:51.94]When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
[02:01.58]Where a girl loves a boy
[02:03.98]And a boy loves a girl
[02:18.72]Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
[02:23.77]It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[02:28.14]Tropical the island breeze
[02:30.44]All of nature, wild and free
[02:32.78]This is where I long to be
[02:35.18]La isla bonita
[02:37.99]And when the samba played
[02:40.24]The sun would set so high
[02:42.52]Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[02:44.69]You Spanish lullaby
[02:49.04]Tropical the island breeze
[02:50.79]All of nature, wild and free
[02:53.25]This is where I long to be
[02:55.61]La isla bonita
[02:58.31]And when the samba played
[03:00.59]The sun would set so high
[03:02.93]Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[03:05.11]You Spanish lullaby
[03:26.00]You Spanish lullaby
