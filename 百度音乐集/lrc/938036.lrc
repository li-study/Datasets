[00:03.92]作词：谢霆锋
[00:05.92]作曲：谢霆锋
[00:07.92]
[00:17.40]I go bring When I look straight into the sun
[00:23.09]I go deaf when I hear thunders on the run
[00:28.85]But when I sse you sleeping here beside me.
[00:32.52]Life's just begun
[00:34.76]I can tell it to the whole world.
[00:37.69]You're the one
[00:38.69]
[00:39.76] I see your shadow cast on the wall
[00:43.31]When the sun shines
[00:45.46]I hear you calling through the window
[00:49.17]when it rains
[00:51.19]I tend to tremble when I start to think of
[00:55.60]just you andl I don't know why.
[00:59.97]There's no reply
[01:03.27]
[01:05.66]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[01:12.20]I'm shivering when I'm standing alone.
[01:18.02]A stom is torming deep inside me.
[01:23.85]A hurricane has got a life of it's own.
[01:28.18]
[01:28.84]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[01:35.38]Without you I'm just falling apart.
[01:41.49]The snow is freezing all my senses,
[01:46.82]When hail falls down,
[01:49.66]Then it's already too late for heartbreak!
[01:57.48]
[02:04.35]I go bring When I look straight into the sun
[02:10.01]I go deaf when I hear thunders on the run
[02:15.66]But when I sse you sleeping here beside me.
[02:19.39]Life's just begun
[02:21.64]I can tell it to the whole world.
[02:24.66]You're the one
[02:26.10]
[02:26.65] I see your shadow cast on the wall
[02:30.49]When the sun shines
[02:32.40]I hear you calling through the window
[02:36.11]when it rains
[02:38.22]I tend to tremble when I start to think of
[02:42.52]just you andl I don't know why.
[02:47.25]There's no reply

[03:01.22]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:07.92]I'm shivering when I'm standing alone.
[03:13.74]A stom is torming deep inside me.
[03:19.41]A hurricane has got a life of it's own.

[03:24.87]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:31.05]Without you I'm just falling apart.

[03:42.49]When hail falls down,
[03:45.34]Then it's already too late for heartbreak!
