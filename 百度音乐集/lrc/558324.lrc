[00:52.31]I’m moving to Tokyo
[00:55.48]Cuz I’m tired of San Francisco
[00:59.01]My contracts are finally void
[01:01.53]And I am getting out
[01:05.10]On houses and building tops
[01:08.54]I swallow the beams and sundrops
[01:12.13]If my echos could reach your ears
[01:14.30]Then I could save my calls
[01:17.89]What happens when I’m above
[01:21.20]The east river when you are in love
[01:24.37]We’re staring at all these lights
[01:27.14]And I am going blind
[01:30.13]
[01:56.47]Fill all of the navy yards
[01:59.44]With hard working security guards
[02:02.52]Cuz the numbers are wearing off
[02:05.59]My plastic access cards
[02:09.67]How can I begin to say
[02:14.86]I feel better off when we stay
[02:17.08]In Paris on winter nights
[02:18.50]Beneath the snowy veil
[02:21.70]Content like a panda bear
[02:24.60]Still breathing the fresh mountain air
[02:28.26]I’ll put on a diving tank
[02:31.14]And sing when I inhale
