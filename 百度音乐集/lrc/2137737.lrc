[00:22.92]哟 哟 哟
[00:32.92]前奏...i know...很长
[01:57.20]For each forgotten kiss
[02:00.52]For all the memories
[02:03.86]For all the times alone
[02:07.28]Said all we had to say
[02:09.94]
[02:10.93]You played your part so well
[02:14.45]A modern Romeo
[02:17.94]You came on Cupid's wings
[02:21.08]And then you flew away
[02:23.75]
[02:24.14]When you touched my face
[02:27.43]When you call my name
[02:30.91]I'm burned with desire
[02:35.96]
[02:37.85]When you touched my face
[02:41.36]When you call my name
[02:44.91]I'm burned with desire
[02:49.24]But you left me in the rain
[02:52.97]ah``````
[03:20.31]For every sleepless night
[03:23.64]Forever in your arms
[03:27.28]For every hour spent
[03:30.60]Lost in the revelry
[03:33.24]
[03:34.12]You broke your promises
[03:37.90]No shame and no regrets
[03:40.96]You burned the bridges too
[03:44.45]An endless mystery
[03:47.09]
[03:47.53]When you touched my face(So beautiful)
[03:50.90]When you call my name(My name..)
[03:54.27]I'm burned with desire
[03:57.12]
[04:01.25]When you touched my face(So beautiful)
[04:04.68]When you call my name(My name..)
[04:08.15]I'm burned with desire
[04:14.78]But you left me in the rain
[05:16.05]When you touched my face(So beautiful)
[05:19.53]When you call my name(My name..)
[05:23.05]I'm burned with desire
[05:26.55]
[05:30.01]When you touched my face
[05:33.35]When you call my name
[05:36.88]I'm burned with desire
[05:41.51]But you left me in the rain
