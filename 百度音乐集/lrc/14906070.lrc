[00:00.00]This was a triumph.
[00:04.03]I'm making a note here:
[00:06.35]HUGE SUCCESS.
[00:08.95]It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
[00:15.29]
[00:16.18]Aperture Science
[00:19.90]We do what we must because we can.
[00:25.17]For the good of all of us.
[00:28.53]Except the ones who are dead.
[00:30.32]
[00:30.71]But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
[00:34.64]You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
[00:38.66]And the Science gets done.
[00:40.67]And you make a neat gun.
[00:42.64]For the people who are still alive.
[00:46.62]
[00:52.02]I'm not even angry.
[00:56.19]I'm being so sincere right now.
[01:01.15]Even though you broke my heart.
[01:04.82]And killed me.
[01:08.23]And tore me to pieces.
[01:11.87]And threw every piece into a fire.
[01:17.15]As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
[01:22.28]
[01:22.70]Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
[01:26.71]And we're out of beta.
[01:28.70]We're releasing on time.
[01:30.68]So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
[01:32.70]Think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.
[01:38.21]
[01:44.29]Go ahead and leave me.
[01:48.11]I think I prefer to stay in side.
[01:53.10]Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
[02:00.15]Maybe Black Mesa
[02:04.12]THAT WAS A JOKE.
[02:05.71]HAHA, FAT CHANCE.
[02:09.15]Anyway, this cake is great.
[02:12.34]It's so delicious and moist.
[02:14.30]
[02:14.75]Look at me still talking when there's Science to do.
[02:18.67]When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
[02:22.67]I've experiments to run.
[02:24.71]There is research to be done.
[02:26.71]On the people who are still alive.
[02:30.65]And believe me I am still alive.
[02:34.63]I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
[02:38.47]I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
[02:42.62]While you're dying I'll be still alive.
[02:46.45]And when you're dead I will be still alive.
[02:50.34]STILL ALIVE
[02:52.32]STILL ALIVE
