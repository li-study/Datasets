[00:13.11]
[00:28.72]If I was your woman
[00:31.07]And you were my man
[00:34.17]You'd have no other woman
[00:37.01]You'd be weak as a lamb
[00:40.41]If you had the strength
[00:43.50]To walk out my door
[00:46.64]My love would over rule my sense
[00:49.57]And I'd call you back for more
[00:52.95]
[02:45.13][02:32.65][02:20.29][02:08.14][01:31.28][00:53.22]If I was your woman
[02:48.15][02:35.75][02:23.23][02:10.75][01:33.36][00:56.04]And you were my man
[02:51.31][02:38.88][02:26.42][02:13.86][01:36.47][00:59.13]If I was your woman
[02:54.41][02:41.97][02:29.44][02:17.01][01:39.61][01:02.31]And you were my man
[02:56.57][02:44.68][01:42.26][01:04.59]
[01:06.68]She tears you down darlin
[01:09.64]Says you're nothing at all
[01:13.04]But I'll pick you up darlin
[01:15.80]When she lets you fall cause
[01:19.58]You're like a diamond
[01:22.14]But she treats you like glass
[01:25.56]Yet you beg her to love you
[01:28.35]But me you won't ask
[01:30.56]
[01:44.10]Life is so crazy
[01:47.20]And love is unkind
[01:50.34]Because she was first darlin'
[01:53.25]Will she hang on your mind?
[01:56.98]You're part of me
[01:59.95]But you don't even know it
[02:03.02]I'm what you need
[02:05.18]But I'm too afraid to show it
[02:08.25]
