[00:09.62]Is this a dream
[00:12.81]If it is
[00:15.09]Please dont wake me from this high
[00:19.60]I've become comfortably numb
[00:24.23]Until you opened up my eyes
[00:28.77]To what its like
[00:30.64]When everything's right
[00:33.34]I cant believe
[00:36.82]You found me
[00:38.81]When no one else was lookin
[00:41.24]How did you know just where I would be
[00:45.75]Yea, you broke through
[00:47.95]All my confusion
[00:50.29]The ups and the downs
[00:52.24]And you still didnt leave
[00:54.76]I guess that you saw what nobody could see
[00:58.71]You found me
[01:03.28]You found me
[01:08.50]So here we are
[01:11.77]That's pretty far
[01:14.19]When you think of where we've been
[01:18.49]No going back
[01:20.38]I'm fading out
[01:23.27]All that has faded me within
[01:27.90]You're by my side
[01:29.96]Now everythings fine
[01:32.20]I cant believe
[01:35.80]You found me
[01:37.92]When no one else was lookin
[01:40.37]How did you know just where I would be
[01:44.22]Yea, you broke through
[01:47.07]All my confusion
[01:49.27]The ups and the downs
[01:51.19]And you still didnt leave
[01:53.93]I guess that you saw what nobody could see
[01:57.88]You found me
[02:02.38]You found me
[02:08.05]And I was hiding
[02:12.15]Til you came along
[02:14.43]And showed me where I belong
[02:23.99]When no one else was lookin
[02:26.60]How did you know
[02:28.84]How did you know
[02:31.08]You found me

[03:07.30]The ups and the downs
[03:08.95]And you still didnt leave
[03:11.78]I guess that you saw what nobody could see
[03:16.25]The good and the bad
[03:18.24]And the things in between
