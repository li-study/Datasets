[ti:]shut your eyes
[ar:]snow patrol
[al:]eyes open

[00:31.81]Shut your eyes and think of somewhere
[00:38.94]Somewhere cold and caked in snow
[00:46.92]By the fire we break the quiet
[00:54.66]Learn to wear each other well
[01:01.81]And when the worrying starts to hurt
[01:05.32]and the world feels like graves of dirt
[01:09.70]Just close your eyes until
[01:13.21]you can imagine this place, you're our secret space at will
[01:33.21]Shut your eyes, I spin the big chair
[01:40.88]And you'll feel dizzy, light, and free
[01:48.56]And falling gently on the cushion
[01:56.15]You can come and sing to me
[02:02.81]And when the worrying starts to hurt
[02:06.75]and the world feels like graves of dirt
[02:11.07]Just close your eyes until
[02:14.48]you can imagine this place, you're our secret space at will
[02:19.13](Shut your eyes )
[02:34.46]Shut your eyes and sing to me (Shut your eyes and sing to me)
