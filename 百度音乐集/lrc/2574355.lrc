[00:01.20]Jay Sean (Feat. Keisha Buchanan) - Far Away
[00:03.31]
[00:10.18]Your laugh, those eyes, your smile, your innocence
[00:14.87]Means everything to me, but you don't know, baby
[00:19.72]The way you hold me, when you're with your friends you want me
[00:24.50]Means everything to me, but you don't know
[00:29.12]We don't even - talk no more
[00:33.86]We don't even - hold hands like we did before
[00:38.84]We don't even - know the reason why it came to be
[00:44.47]That even though you're with me
[00:47.25]Feel so far away
[00:52.09]Feel so far away
[00:56.93]Feel so far away-ay-ay-ay
[01:06.31]Feel so far away
[01:10.85]Feel so far away
[01:15.37]
[01:17.44]I kiss you, without tear, plus some ecstasy
[01:22.10]But somehow your lips feel so cold, baby
[01:27.04]We're perfect, aren't we in their eyes only
[01:31.80]But you and I both konw the spark has gone
[01:36.42]We don't even - talk no more
[01:41.27]We don't even - make love like we did before
[01:46.12]We don't even - know the reason why it came to be
[01:51.77]That even though you're with me
[01:54.60]Feel so far away
[01:59.32]Feel so far away
[02:04.21]Feel so far away-ay-ay-ay
[02:13.98]Feel so far away
[02:18.80]Feel so far away
[02:23.39]
[02:25.20]Let's maybe take the time so we can see (yeah)
[02:30.22]How beautiful this love can be (so beautiful)
[02:35.07]And know we can't erase what we both feel
[02:38.68]So let's fall back into what we had
[02:43.13]Now I don't feel so far away
[02:49.00]Feel so far away
[02:53.80]Feel so far away-ay-ay-ay
[03:03.43]Feel so far away
[03:08.25]Feel so far away
[03:12.10]Away ohh
[03:14.30]
