[00:24.18]Etceteranough?
[00:26.97]Etceteranough?
[00:29.71]Etceteranough?
[00:35.33]Etceteranough?
[00:38.16]Etceteranough?
[00:40.94]Etceteranough?
[00:43.89]Fire it up, fire it up
[00:46.76]When we finally turn it over
[00:49.58]Make a B-line towards the border
[00:52.28]Have a drink, you've had enough
[00:55.13]Fire it up, fire it up
[00:57.98]If you need some conversation
[01:00.63]Bring a magazine to read around
[01:03.70]Our broke down transportation
[01:05.94]Fire it up
[01:07.98]Etceteranough?
[01:10.80]Etceteranough?
[01:13.63]Etceteranough?
[01:16.73]Fire it up, fire it up
[01:19.59]When we find the perfect water
[01:22.34]We'll hang out on the shore
[01:24.89]Just long enough to leave our clothes there
[01:27.88]Fine enough, fine enough
[01:30.77]Oh we ate all of the oranges
[01:33.47]Off the navels of our lovers
[01:36.29]Grabbed a book and read the cover
[01:39.11]It honestly was beautifully done
[01:50.33]Like trying to hide the daylight from the sun
[02:01.49]But even if we had been sure enough it's true we really didn't know
[02:12.60]Even if we knew which way to head but still we probably wouldn't go
[02:23.98]
[02:46.46]Fire it up, fire it up
[02:49.22]We pushed off we're rolling boulders
[02:52.06]Crashing down the mirrored stairways
[02:54.95]Two of life's best mind canaries
[02:57.47]Fire it up, fire it up
[03:01.92]When we fix the carburetor
[03:03.48]Then we'll push off once again
[03:06.38]In an hour or so later
[03:09.10]It honestly was beautifully bold
[03:20.49]Like trying to save an ice cube from the cold
[03:31.33]But even if we had been sure enough it's true we really didn't know
[03:42.64]Even if we knew which way to head but still we probably wouldn't go
[03:53.99]Well we always
[03:56.59]Well we always
[03:59.47]had it all
[04:03.09]had it all
[04:05.07]Well we always
[04:07.85]Well we always
[04:10.43]had it all
[04:13.31]had it all
[04:16.27]Well we always
[04:18.97]Well we always
[04:21.81]had it all
