[00:13.87]In this room of darkness I ain't undercover
[00:17.41]That won't stop my prowess rubbing off on to another
[00:20.90]Elevating higher as my body's moving lower
[00:24.31]Now I've reached my element you better move over oh
[00:28.87]But he doesn't he blocks my way
[00:31.66]I try to push past but he wants to play
[00:35.35]So I sip his drink as I hold his gaze
[00:42.32]When we erupt into the room
[00:45.83]And hear the sub go boom
[00:49.21]A feeling easy to resume
[00:51.72]This right here I swear will end too soon
[00:56.34]So I sink into the tune
[00:59.78]As I inhale the fume
[01:03.00]A feeling easy to resume
[01:05.18]This right here I swear will end too soon
[01:09.12](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[01:15.69](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[01:22.51](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[01:29.38](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[01:34.55]
[01:35.99]My limbs seem to move what the beat dictates to me
[01:39.54]I push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
[01:43.09]Taking me back to that sweet familiarity
[01:46.53]Making my adrenalin rise I feel the eyes on me
[01:51.13]Sip the bottle now don't be slow
[01:54.52]Keep up with me as we lose control
[01:57.78]Keep up with me as we lose control
[02:05.00]When we erupt into the room
[02:08.12]And hear the sub go boom
[02:11.61]A feeling easy to resume
[02:13.94]This right here I swear will end too soon
[02:18.60]So I sink into the tune
[02:22.00]As I inhale the fume
[02:25.42]A feeling easy to resume
[02:27.79]This right here I swear will end too soon
[02:31.49](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[02:37.97](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[02:44.84](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[02:51.81](This right here I swear will end too soon)
[02:59.79]When we erupt into the room
[03:03.19]And hear the sub go boom
[03:06.60]A feeling easy to resume
[03:08.51]This right here I swear will end too soon
[03:13.62]So I sink into the tune
[03:16.95]As I inhale the fume
[03:20.35]A feeling easy to resume
[03:22.57]This right here I swear will end too soon
[03:27.85]
