[00:13.39]
[00:13.89]Here we go again
[00:15.39]Sitting on the edge of leaving
[00:20.41]You don't have to speak
[00:22.05]I can see it in your eyes
[00:27.30]I know you too well
[00:29.16]You know I can tell your hiding
[00:32.49]Something inside
[00:35.55]
[00:39.99]Baby just breathe in  breathe out
[00:44.05]Before you turn around just slow down
[00:47.40]Think of all the love we've made
[00:53.16]If we give it just one more try
[00:57.57]Maybe we could stop this goodbye
[01:00.96]I know through all this pain
[01:04.28]Somehow somewhere love remains
[01:08.75]
[01:14.44]You say don't walk away
[01:16.01]But baby give me one good reason
[01:21.24]More than just a line
[01:22.83]You better make it count this time
[01:27.39]You told me but you never really showed me
[01:33.38]That I'm worth the fight
[01:36.78]Oh I'm worth the fight
[01:40.88]
[01:41.12]Baby just breathe in  breathe out
[01:44.80]Before you turn around just slow down
[01:48.24]Think of all the love we've made
[01:53.87]If we give it just one more try
[01:58.35]Maybe we could stop this goodbye
[02:01.68]I know through all this pain
[02:05.19]Somehow somewhere love remains
[02:09.55]
[02:22.33]Love takes time to build its defenses
[02:28.45]And trust takes time to tear down those fences
[02:35.50]And love remains that's stronger than ever before
[02:45.72]So don't walk out that door
[02:55.44]I don't wanna hurt anymore
[02:59.94]
[03:01.83]Baby just breathe in  breathe out
[03:06.15]The only time for love is right now
[03:09.32]Forgive all of the mistakes we've made
[03:15.05]If we give it just one more try
[03:19.48]Maybe we could stop this goodbye
[03:22.93]Through the fire and rain
[03:26.33]Somehow somewhere
[03:29.66]I know through this pain
[03:33.01]Somehow somewhere love remains
[03:38.50]
[03:49.21]So baby just breathe in  breathe out
[03:56.00]
[04:04.06]I never wanted to give up this fight
[04:07.24]What if we give it baby one more try?
[04:10.70]Let's try this time
[04:16.21]Baby this time
[04:22.73]Baby this time
[04:29.64]Baby this time
[04:32.31]
