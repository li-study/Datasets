[00:00.00]Brand New - Daisy
[00:01.20]
[00:01.87]And we sing this morning
[00:03.97]that wonderful and grand old message.
[00:07.49]I don't know about you
[00:08.17]but I never get tired of it
[00:10.63]Number 99: Just As I Am.
[00:14.82]
[00:15.30]I'm a mountain that has been moved
[00:19.64]I'm a river that is all dried up
[00:23.90]I'm an ocean nothing floats on
[00:27.95]I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
[00:32.08]I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
[00:36.53]I'm a moon that never shows it's face
[00:41.04]I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
[00:44.99]I'm a word that no one ever wants to say...
[00:49.96]
[01:06.36]I don't wanna be,
[01:09.40]He wasn't finding anybody
[01:11.57]when he was on the shelf
[01:15.96]I saw him in my dream
[01:18.20]
[01:23.22]I'm a mountain that has been moved
[01:27.47]I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
[01:32.08]I'm a preacher with no pulpit
[01:36.02]Spewing a sermon that goes on and on...
[01:39.54]Well if we take all these things
[01:41.66]and we bury them fast
[01:43.89]And we'll pray that they turn into seeds,
[01:46.62]to roots and then grass
[01:48.54]It'd be all right, it's all right,
[01:52.38]it'd be easier that way
[01:56.67]Or if the sky opened up
[01:58.82]and started pouring rain
[02:01.19]Like he knew it was time to
[02:03.37]start things over again
[02:05.44]It'd be all right, it's all right,
[02:09.43]it'd be easier that way
[02:13.28]Well if we take all these things
[02:16.69]and we bury them fast
[02:19.60]And we'll pray that they turn into seeds,
[02:21.21]to roots and then grass
[02:22.49]It'd be all right, it's all right,
[02:26.72]it'd be easier that way
[02:30.69]Or if the sky opened up
[02:33.59]and started pouring rain
[02:35.49]Like he knew it was time to
[02:37.70]start things over again
[02:39.79]It'd be all right, it's all right,
[02:43.70]it'd be easier that way
