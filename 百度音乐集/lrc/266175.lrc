[00:47.24]So true funny how it seems
[00:51.92]always in time but never in line for dreams
[00:59.05]Head over heels when toe to toe
[01:04.26]This is the sound of my soul
[01:09.65]this is the sound
[01:12.80]
[01:14.34]I bought a ticket to the world
[01:19.90]but now I've come back again
[01:25.20]why do I find it hard to write the next line
[01:29.75]Oh I want the truth to be said
[01:33.13]
[01:35.63]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[01:40.40]I know this much is true
[01:46.53]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[01:50.98]I know this much is true
[01:59.55]
[02:05.66]With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
[02:11.88]dissolve the nerves that I've just begun
[02:17.21]Listening to Marvin(all night long)
[02:22.89]This is the sound of my soul
[02:28.13]this is the sound
[02:31.62]
[02:33.12]Always slipping from my hands
[02:38.36]Sets a time of its own
[02:43.69]Take your seaside arms and write the next line
[02:48.42]Oh I want the truth to be known
[02:52.03]
[02:54.03]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[02:58.65]I know this much is true
[03:04.99]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[03:09.46]I know this much is true
[03:17.91]
[04:07.45]I bought a ticket to the world
[04:13.06]but now I've come back again
[04:18.34]Why do I find it hard to write the next line
[04:23.00]Oh I want the truth to be said
[04:26.30]
[04:28.81]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[04:33.33]I know this much is true
[04:39.78]Huh huh huh huh huh huh
[04:44.18]I know this much is true
