[01:00.25]
[01:02.29]is on your lips.
[01:04.14]

[01:18.57]

[02:17.93]point the finger,
[02:20.13]
[02:22.84]but it's on your head.
[02:24.90]
[02:25.73]Your destination
[02:27.26]
[02:28.02]is a choice
[02:29.19]
[02:29.58]within yourself.
[02:30.85]
[02:31.38]Will you rise?
[02:32.72]
[02:34.59]Or become a
[02:35.82]
[02:36.62]slave
[02:37.85]
[02:38.81]to self-righteousness?
[02:41.34]

[02:43.32]
[02:45.40]and gaze within.
