[00:06.70]
[00:12.66]Who can say where the road goes,
[00:17.91]Where the day flows
[00:20.65]Only time...
[00:24.04]And who can say if your love grows,
[00:29.34]As your heart chose
[00:32.35]Only time...
[00:34.13]
[01:02.33]Who can say why your heart sighs,
[01:07.12]As your love flies
[01:10.06]Only time...
[01:13.48]And who can say why your heart cries,
[01:18.70]When your love dies
[01:21.59]Only time...
[01:23.70]
[01:51.31]Who can say when the roads meet,
[01:56.37]That love might be,
[01:59.19]In your heart.
[02:02.72]And who can say when the day sleeps,
[02:07.93]If the night keeps all your heart
[02:14.63]Night keeps all your heart...
[02:18.83]
[02:45.14]Who can say if your love grows,
[02:50.05]As your heart chose
[02:53.08]Only time...
[02:56.26]And who can say where the road goes,
[03:01.59]Where the day flows
[03:04.63]Only time...
[03:08.33]Who knows
[03:10.35]Only time...
[03:14.12]Who knows
[03:16.33]Only time...
