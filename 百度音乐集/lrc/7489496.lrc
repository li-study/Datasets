[00:10.76]I remember the way you made love to me
[00:14.36]Like I was all you'd ever need
[00:17.84]Did you change your mind
[00:21.33]Well I didn't change mine
[00:25.66]Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
[00:28.23]We were best friends now we don't even talk
[00:31.16]You broke my heart
[00:34.87]Ripped my world apart
[02:46.22][00:37.23]
[03:16.25][02:47.64][01:46.39][00:38.95]Didn't you know how much I loved you
[03:19.75][02:51.17][01:49.86][00:42.47]Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby
[03:26.06][02:58.17][01:56.15][00:49.29]I gave you everything, every part of me
[03:30.29][03:02.36][02:00.42][00:53.48]Didn't you feel it when I touched you
[03:33.79][03:05.89][02:03.91][00:57.01]Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby
[03:40.30][03:12.41][02:10.46][01:03.53]Baby, tell me
[02:15.23][01:08.51]Didn't you know how much I loved you
[02:19.73]
[01:17.63]I can't get you out of my head
[01:21.25]I still feel you in this bed
[01:24.28]Left me all alone
[01:27.65]You couldn't be more gone
[01:32.57]From falling apart to fighting mad
[01:36.04]From wanting you back to not giving a damn
[01:38.92]I've felt it all
[01:42.46]I've been to the wall
[02:30.65][01:45.61]
[02:32.42]One day justice will come and find you
[02:38.37]And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you
[03:54.02]I gave you everything, every part of me
