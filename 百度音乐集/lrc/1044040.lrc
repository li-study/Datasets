[08:40.176]
[15:18.109]Lights go down
[02:50.216]It's dark
[03:27.129]The jungle is your head
[02:48.846]Can't rule your heart
[05:53.244]I'm feeling so much stronger
[03:57.959]Than I thought
[02:36.935]Your eyes are wide
[06:04.440]And though your soul
[03:54.955]it can't be bought
[09:02.394]your mind can wander

[06:08.723]The night is full of holes
[14:21.225]Those bullets rip the sky
[06:10.419]Of ink with gold
[17:24.949]They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
[04:21.597]They know that they can't dance
[06:42.688]At least they know
[15:26.547]
[05:37.187]I can't stand the beat
[01:55.901]I'm askin' for the cheque
[10:53.740]Girl with crimson nails
[00:38.597]Has Jesus 'round the neck
[00:16.037]Swinging to the music
[07:55.834]Swinging to the music
