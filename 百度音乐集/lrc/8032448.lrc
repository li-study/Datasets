[00:07.19]
[00:18.42]When I go and I get lonely
[00:22.37]I begin to think of you
[00:28.25]But I know a dream it's only
[00:31.29]And I'm a fool
[00:33.00]
[00:36.47]Papa said that you'd be long gone
[00:39.48]And not to waste my time on you
[00:43.43]I see you every day in sunshine
[00:47.38]And I'm a fool
[00:50.64]
[00:51.32]Am I a fool to you?
[00:58.02]Do you like it that way
[01:00.36]
[01:10.33]Emerald Eyes, I see you somewhere
[01:14.28]Why your eyes so blue?
[01:18.06]Love can be like holding your breath
[01:23.00]Is that the way fools do?
[01:26.30]
[01:26.86](Way fools do)
[01:32.02]
[01:34.06]I haven't time to talk about it
[01:37.84]But I admit I've been a fool
[01:41.95]Though I shouldn't think about it
[01:44.76]I need you
[01:48.79]
[01:49.23]Can't stand it baby
[01:54.31]Am I a fool to you?
[01:59.75]
[02:06.33]Emerald Eyes, I see you somewhere
[02:11.87]Why your eyes so blue?
[02:16.03]Love can be like holding your breath
[02:20.12]Is that the way fools do?
[02:25.20]
[02:26.07]Emerald Eyes, I see you somewhere
[02:30.78]Why your eyes so blue?
[02:34.94]Love can be like holding your breath
[02:39.10]Is that the way fools do?
[02:42.28]Emerald Eyes, I see you somewhere
[02:48.00]Emerald Eyes
[02:55.03]Emerald Eyes
[03:04.24]Am I a fool to you?
