[00:06.04]
[01:27.67]Nothing is in this world can be
[01:30.30]as immaculate and pure
[01:33.03]as the love of us Cold Ones for the dead.
[01:39.76]Our love lives only in those fleeting moments of recollection ...
[01:43.02]- memories we're fearing to forgot.
[01:50.56]
[02:17.26]Our love knows neither kiss or touch,
[02:20.54]we are embracing dust,
[02:23.27]air or ourselves when visualizing what we've lost.
[02:29.57]Awoken by a sound or scent,
[02:32.61]some visions call sad phantoms ...,
[02:35.56]floating, wrapped in fading colours ...- our lament.
[02:42.40]
[03:08.78]And then there is the all-devouring dread:
[03:14.63]"some day I might not bring him back ...,
[03:20.57]when my feeble mind can't help but lose the contours of his face".
[03:33.36]Lost forever, lone and sad, gone forever to the dead ...
[03:44.32]- so far beyond the barriers of the opposite space.
[03:56.95]
[03:57.79]Yet, alas, despite it all ...
[04:03.15]walking through these deserted halls ...
[04:10.74]It's easy ... still ... to love the dead...-
[04:18.84]It's easier to love the dead.
