[03:24.49]He searched for those wings that he knew
[03:26.70]that this angel should have at her back.
[03:28.36]And although he can't find them
[03:31.42]he really don't mind
[03:31.99]because he knows they'll grow back.
[03:32.48]And he reaches for that halo that he knows
[03:32.93]that she had when she first caught his eye.
[03:33.36]Although his hand came back empty
[03:33.81]he's really not worried
[03:34.33]because he knows it still shines.
[03:34.63]
[03:34.87]I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
[03:35.11]or keep this tarnished halo shining
[03:35.31]but I'll never betray your trust
[03:35.53]angel mine.
[03:35.73]
[03:35.97]I'll search all the time on the ground
[03:36.19]for our shadows cast side by side.
[03:36.43]Just to remind me that I haven't gone crazy
[03:36.63]that you exist and are mine.
[03:36.83]And I know that your skin is warm and as real
[03:37.01]as that smile in your eyes.
[03:37.21]But I have to keep touching and smelling
[03:40.64]and tasting for fear it's all lies.
[03:41.15]
[03:41.59]I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
[03:41.86]or keep this tarnished halo shining
[03:42.07]but I'll never betray your trust
[03:42.28]angel mine.
[03:42.47]
[03:42.68]Last night I awoke from the deepest of sleeps
[03:42.91]with your voice in my head.
[03:43.16]And I could tell by your breathing
[03:43.38]that you were still sleeping
[03:43.61]I repeated those words that you had said.
[03:43.82]
[03:44.09]I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
[03:44.32]or keep this tarnished halo shining
[03:44.55]but I'll never betray your trust
[03:44.78]angel mine.
