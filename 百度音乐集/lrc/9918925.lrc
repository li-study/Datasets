[00:43.56]Look at me
[00:45.61]I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter
[00:53.67]Can it be I'm not meant to play this part?
[01:01.17]
[01:01.80]Now I see that if I were truly to be myself
[01:09.33]I would break my family's heart
[01:13.38]
[01:17.56]Who is that girl I see
[01:22.76]Staring straight back at me?
[01:27.80]Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
[01:38.28]Somehow I cannot hide
[01:43.86]Who I am, though I've tried
[01:48.96]When will my reflection show who I am inside
[02:00.42]
[02:02.62]When will my reflection show who I am inside
