[00:11.48]...Yeahh...
[00:16.28]Can you imagine us, making love?
[00:21.20]The way it would feel the first time that we touched.
[00:25.71]Can you think of it, the way I dream of it?
[00:31.07]I want you to see it like I’m seeing it.
[00:35.03]It’s affliction of perfection
[00:38.42]The vision of your direction
[00:41.92]Your lips upon my lips,
[00:44.98]Can you just picture this?
[00:46.81]Your finger tips on my finger tips.
[00:51.68]Your skin upon my skin,
[00:54.86]Would be the sweetest sin.
[00:59.28]That would be the sweetest sin.
[01:06.28]All night I lay awake,
[01:08.77]Cause it's to much to take.
[01:11.64]Dreaming about the love that we could make.
[01:16.47]All day I think of schemes,
[01:18.89]To get you next to me.
[01:21.50]I want you so bad that I can barely breathe.
[01:25.53]It’s a sign of my obsession…
[01:29.13]That I can't stop thinking bout…
[01:32.38]Your lips upon my lips,
[01:35.38]Can you just picture this?
[01:37.44]Your finger tips on my finger tips.
[01:42.35]Your skin upon my skin,
[01:45.57]Would be the sweetest sin...
[01:48.70]Would be the sweetest sin,
[01:50.75]You are the sweetest sin.
[01:52.67]Your lips upon my lips,
[01:55.77]Can you envision this?
[01:57.70]Temptation I could never resist.
[02:02.64]Your skin upon my skin,
[02:05.89]Would be the sweetest sin.
[02:11.08]That would be the sweetest sin.
[02:15.78]It would feel so good,
[02:18.34]To be so bad.
[02:20.78]You don’t know how bad,
[02:23.84]I want that I would,
[02:26.68]Do anything to feel your...
[02:31.05]Your lips upon my lips,
[02:33.91]Can you just picture this?
[02:35.25]Your finger tips on my finger tips.
[02:40.50]Your skin upon my skin…
[02:44.19]Would be the sweetest sin.
[02:47.28]Baby, that would be the sweetest sin.
[02:51.88]Your lips upon my lips,
[02:54.63]Would be the sweetest sin.
