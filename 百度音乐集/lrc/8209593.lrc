[00:42.84]YOUR LATEST TRICK
[00:44.08]
[01:02.83]All the late night bargains have been struck
[01:08.82]Between the satin beaus and their belles
[01:12.06]And prehistoric garbage trucks
[01:16.08]Have the city to themselves
[01:20.45]Echoes roars dinosaurs
[01:23.25]They're all doing the monster mash
[01:26.22]And most of the taxis and the whores
[01:31.16]Are only taking calls for cash
[01:32.62]
[01:35.78]I don't know how it happened
[01:38.49]It all took place so quick
[01:42.05]But all I can do is hand it to you
[01:48.42]And your latest trick
[01:49.51]
[02:05.06]My door was standing open
[02:08.00]Security was laid back and lax
[02:12.34]But it was only my heart got broken
[02:18.55]You must have had a pass key made out of wax
[02:19.65]You played robbery with insolence
[02:22.04]And I played the blues in twelve bars down Lover's Lane
[02:26.51]And you never did have the intelligence to use
[02:30.12]The twelve keys hanging off my chain
[02:32.64]
[02:35.16]I don't know how it happened
[02:37.48]It all took place so quick
[02:40.53]But all I can do is hand it to you
[02:47.47]And your latest trick
[02:49.60]
[03:03.66]Now it's past last call for alcohol
[03:06.77]Past recall has been here and gone
[03:10.59]The landlord finally paid us all
[03:13.81]The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
[03:17.63]And we're standing outside of this wonderland
[03:22.43]Looking so bereaved and so bereft
[03:26.01]Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
[03:33.58]The bottle's empty and there's nothing left
[03:34.45]
[03:35.56]I don't know how it happened
[03:36.86]It was faster than the eye could flick
[03:38.16]But now all I can do is hand it to you
[03:45.80]And your latest trick
[03:56.64][03:47.76][03:46.89][00:38.80]
