[03:55.59][02:42.74][00:11.69]
[00:31.38]I was so in love with you
[00:34.24]You rarely see a love that true
[00:40.46][00:37.46]Wasn't that enough for you
[00:43.60]I would climb a mountain
[00:46.36]I wouldn't want to see you fall
[00:49.46]Rock climb for you
[00:51.71]And give you a reason for it all
[02:56.36][01:43.54][00:54.90]You kept on thinking
[03:01.00][01:48.00][00:59.25]You were the only one
[03:08.53][01:55.66][01:07.05]Too busy thinking
[03:13.77][02:00.89][01:12.30]Love is a gun
[01:16.17]
[01:19.52]Hit me like a slow bullet
[01:22.98]Like a slow bullet
[01:32.07]It took me some time to realise it
[02:04.76][01:35.16]
[02:07.30]I know that they envy it
[02:10.82]fore' the storys' been told wrong
[02:19.45]It's not that complicated
[02:22.79]But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul
[03:17.65][02:53.32][02:29.08]
[03:20.10]I know the end before
[03:24.30]The story's been told
[03:32.53]It's not that complicated
[03:37.80]But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul
[04:06.17][03:42.07]
[04:08.79]You were trigger happy baby
[04:14.87]You never warned me let me free
[04:20.95]It's not that complicated
[04:26.40]But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul
[04:32.72]Think you got it but you got all the trouble you need
[04:45.25]I came in like a lamb
[04:49.44]But I intend to leave like a lion
[04:54.73]
[05:10.65][04:58.59]It hit me like a slow bullet
[05:14.62]
