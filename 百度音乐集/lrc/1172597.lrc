[00:10.03]He was a most peculiar man
[00:18.78]That's what Mrs. Reardon says
[00:21.44]and she should know
[00:24.25]She lived upstairs from him
[00:29.47]She said he was a most peculiar man
[00:38.31]He was a most peculiar man
[00:47.27]He lived all alone within a house
[00:49.40]Within a room, within himself
[00:59.79]A most peculiar man
[01:06.83]He had no friends, he seldom spoke
[01:13.90]And no one in turn ever spoke to him
[01:16.65]'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't
[01:18.98]care
[01:20.87]And he wasn't like them
[01:23.61]O, no-o-o!
[01:25.14]He was a most peculiar man
[01:33.92]He died last Sat-ur-day...
[01:41.72]He turned on the gas! and he went to sleep!
[01:42.78]With the windows closed!
[01:45.50]So he'd never wake up!
[01:46.85]To his silent world!
[01:48.22]and his tiny room!
[01:49.62]And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere!
[01:55.06]Who should be notified so-oo-oon...
[02:01.63]And all the people said,
[02:02.56]What a shame that he's dead,
[02:03.95]But wasn't he a most peculiar man?
