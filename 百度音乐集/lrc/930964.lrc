[00:-7.50]《My Heart Will Go On》
[00:-1.50]Sung By "Celine Dion"

[00:12.50]Every night in my dreams
[00:16.50]I see you, I feel you
[00:21.50]That is how I know you go on.
[00:31.50]Far across the distance
[00:35.50]and spaces between us
[00:41.50]You have come to show you go on.
[00:49.50]
[00:50.50]Near, far, wherever you are
[00:59.50]I believe that the heart does go on
[01:10.50]Once more, you opened the door
[01:18.50]And you're here in my heart,
[01:23.50]and my heart will go on and on.
[01:38.50]
[01:39.50]Love can touch us one time
[01:44.50]and last for a lifetime
[01:49.50]And never let go till we've gone.
[01:59.50]Love was when I loved you,
[02:03.50]one true time to hold on to
[02:09.50]In my life we'll always go on.
[02:17.50]
[02:18.50]Near, far, wherever you are
[02:27.50]I believe that the heart does go on
[02:38.50]Once more, you opened the door
[02:46.50]And you're here in my heart,
[02:51.50]and my heart will go on and on.
[03:15.50]
[03:16.50]You're here, there's nothing I fear
[03:24.50]And I know that my heart will go on.
[03:36.50]We'll stay, forever this way
[03:44.50]You are safe in my heart
[03:49.50]and my heart will go on and on.
