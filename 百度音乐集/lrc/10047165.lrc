[00:51.50]The Platters
[00:53.50]
[00:54.50]They asked me how I knew my true love was true. Oh,
[01:08.50]I of course replied
[01:12.50]"something here inside cannot be denied."
[01:27.50]They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind."
[01:37.50]Oh,When your heart's on fire,
[01:46.50]you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
[02:02.50]So I chaffed them
[02:06.50]and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love.
[02:18.50]Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love.
[02:35.50]Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide. Oh,
[02:49.50]So I smile and say
[02:54.50]"when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes!"
[03:05.50]Smoke gets in your eyes
[03:09.50]Smoke gets in your eyes
[03:19.50]
