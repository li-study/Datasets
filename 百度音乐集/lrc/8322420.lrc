[00:11.33]We got the afternoon
[00:16.19]You got this room for two
[00:21.46]One thing I've left to do
[00:25.59]Discover me
[00:27.03]Discovering you
[00:29.06]
[00:31.35]One mile to every inch of
[00:36.55]Your skin like porcelain
[00:41.19]One pair of candy lips and
[00:46.05]Your bubblegum tongue
[00:47.88]
[00:50.69]'Cause if you want love
[00:53.43]We'll make it
[00:55.55]Swimming a deep sea
[00:58.24]Of blankets
[01:00.67]Take all your big plans
[01:03.24]And break 'em
[01:05.56]This is bound to be a while
[01:09.07]
[01:10.25]Your body Is a wonderland
[01:15.18]Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
[01:20.16]Your body Is a wonderland
[01:23.29]
[01:27.17]Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
[01:32.13]I love the shape you take
[01:33.93]When crawling towards the pillowcase
[01:37.11]You tell me where to go and
[01:39.62]Though I might leave to find it
[01:42.08]I'll never let your head hit the bed
[01:44.78]Without my hand behind it
[01:47.34]You want love?
[01:48.90]We'll make it
[01:51.39]Swimming a deep sea
[01:54.05]Of blankets
[01:56.54]Take all your big plans
[01:59.06]And break 'em
[02:01.32]This is bound to be a while
[02:04.89]
[02:06.11]Your body Is a wonderland
[02:10.78]Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
[02:16.15]Your body Is a wonderland
[02:19.11]
[02:25.83]Damn baby
[02:30.51]You frustrate me
[02:34.80]I know you're mine all mine all mine
[02:39.96]But you look so good it hurts sometimes
[02:43.28]
[03:12.06]Your body Is a wonderland
[03:17.17]Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
