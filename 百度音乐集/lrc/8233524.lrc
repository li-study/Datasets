[00:00.56]Tilly And The Wall-I Found You
[00:01.16]
[00:04.00]I, I went down walking
[00:07.27]The sky was bright
[00:11.36]Red flowers blooming
[00:14.82]The sky was bright (so bright!)
[00:17.10]
[00:18.58]And I could hear that rock 'n' roll coming out your radio (that's right!)
[00:23.56]
[00:26.75]I, I went down walking
[00:29.95]The sun was hot (so hot!)
[00:33.67]The streets were melt, melt, melting
[00:37.39]The sun was hot (so hot!)
[00:39.29]
[00:41.23]And I could hear the rock 'n' roll coming out your front window
[00:46.82]Yeah, I was look, look, looking for you
[00:50.13]
[00:53.19]I, I went down walking
[00:56.40]The wind's so cold
[01:00.48]The leaves build my path
[01:03.80]The wind grew cold
[01:06.16]
[01:07.95]I was taken by the light that had fell on such a sight
[01:12.27](Uh huh, yeah, that's right)
[01:15.84]Over and over and over and over again
[01:20.44]
[01:40.53]I, I went down walking
[01:43.59]The snow made angels on the ground
[01:47.18]Icicles hang, hang, hanging
[01:50.94]The snow made angels all around
[01:53.87]
[01:55.10]And I stumbled through the snow on the way to your front door
[01:58.92]I felt the earth beneath my feet push, push, push, pushing me
[02:02.83]And all that I could see were lights falling all around me
[02:06.69]I was look, look, looking for you
[02:08.57]I was look, look, looking for you
[02:10.45]I was look, look, looking for you
[02:12.27]I was look, look, looking for you
[02:15.08]
[02:17.96]End
