[00:06.87]I know that look in your eyes
[00:10.16]I don't wanna say goodnight
[00:13.74]Do anything to change your mind
[00:17.26]Try to make you see the light
[00:20.52]You turn your back and still I say
[00:24.26]Anything to make you stay
[00:27.70]Put up walls made of heartbreak
[00:31.16]Try to hide your love away
[00:34.62]I'm standing here
[00:35.88]You're giving me nothing
[00:38.14]Try to feel your heartbeat through the door
[00:42.33]Hold on, hold on, is what I'm doing
[00:49.54]So strong, so strong, is what I'm feeling
[00:56.15]It's too much, too much
[01:00.97]Oh, don't let go
[01:07.70]Don't let go
[01:16.45]There's something that you're going through
[01:19.89]Wish that I could fix for you
[01:23.33]You don't have to be alone
[01:26.81]I don't wanna let you go
[01:30.14]I'm standing here
[01:31.51]You're giving me nothing
[01:33.79]Try to heal your heart break through the door
[01:37.53]Call it love, call it what you want to
[01:40.66]It's the only thing that matters anymore
[01:45.10]Hold on, hold on, is what I'm doing
[01:52.03]So strong, so strong, is what I'm feeling
[01:58.58]It's too much, too much
[02:04.16]Oh, don't let go
[02:11.32]Oh, don't let go
[02:18.01]Don't let go
[02:24.25]Ohhhhhhhh
[02:27.53]Some days are cold
[02:31.84]But together
[02:34.52]One day we'll both
[02:38.90]Change the weather
[02:42.27]It gets better
[02:50.31]Ooooooooh
[02:53.40]Hold on, hold on, is what I'm doing
[03:00.36]So strong, so strong, is what I'm feeling
[03:06.95]It's too much, too much
[03:12.30]Ohhhhhhohhhhh, don't let go
[03:18.76]Ohhhhhhohhhhh, don't let go
