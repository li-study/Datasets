[00:08.28]Drifting out of time
[00:15.72]Something on your mind
[00:23.12]And I wanna be the
[00:24.48]One that you call
[00:25.97]When you get down
[00:30.65]No matter where you
[00:32.29]Are in the world I'll be around
[03:10.46][01:49.08][00:39.32]Fly me away on an Aeroplane
[03:18.03][01:56.48][00:46.78]High in the sky
[03:21.23][01:59.84][00:50.15]Wanna see you again

[03:34.69][02:13.45][01:03.80]Gonna get it back that feeling
[03:40.40][02:18.83][01:08.92]
[01:18.08]Miles and miles of sun
[01:25.98]Endless roads twist on
[01:33.01]Don't wanna live a life
[01:34.81]In a world that's all the same
[01:40.79]The crazy little things
[01:42.57]That you do are magical
[01:47.02]

[02:38.99]This crazy world
[02:42.86]We're living in is
[02:46.82]Magical
