[00:10.13]Oh, perilous place
[00:13.64]Walk backwards toward you
[00:17.56]Blink disbelieving eyes chilled to the bone
[00:24.09]Most visibly brave
[00:27.09]No apprehended bloom
[00:31.35]First to take this foot to virgin snow
[00:34.82]
[00:38.76]I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment
[00:45.63]I am a wunderkind, oooooh
[00:52.31]I live in the envelope, pushed far enough to believe this
[00:59.27]I am a princess on the way to my throne
[01:05.27]Destined to serve, destined to roam
[01:13.57]
[01:18.59]Oh, ominous place
[01:21.89]Spellbound and un-childproofed
[01:26.30]My least favourite chill to bear alone
[01:32.30]Compatriots in place
[01:35.74]They'd cringe if I told you
[01:40.34]Our best back pocket secret our bond full blown
[01:45.60]
[01:47.29]I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment
[01:54.17]I am a wunderkind, oooooh
[02:00.92]I am a pioneer, naive enough to believe this
[02:07.80]I am a princess on the way to my throne
[02:13.50]Destined to seek, destined to roam
[02:22.63]
[02:40.77]Most beautiful place
[02:44.16]Reborn and blown off roof
[02:48.45]My view about face weather, great will be done
[02:53.16]
[02:55.87]I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment
[03:02.71]I am a wunderkind, oooooh
[03:09.54]I am a groundbreaker, naive enough to believe this
[03:16.33]I am a princess on the way to my throne
[03:21.77]
[03:23.40]I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment
[03:31.26]I am a wunderkind, oooooh
[03:37.12]I am a Joan of Arc, and smart enough to believe this
[03:43.76]I am a princess on the way to my throne
[03:49.44]Destined to reign, destined to roam
[04:02.74]Destined to reign, destined to roam
[04:44.12]Destined to reign, destined to roam
[04:58.43]Destined to reign, destined to roam
