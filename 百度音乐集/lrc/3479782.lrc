[02:58.96]Till We Meet Again
[03:00.25]
[03:04.03]Some people search all their lives
[03:04.34]I feel that my turn has come to reach high into the sky
[03:04.52]And finally the star shines on me
[03:04.73]Finally, I can touch eternity
[03:04.93]My life will never be the same
[03:05.13]My heart is burning without shame
[03:05.34]I feel the sun on me
[03:05.61]When you return,you'll see the change
[03:05.84]Some people search all the time
[03:06.03]They're walking closely to the ground
[03:06.23]I find and gazing on high
[03:06.44]and finally the star shines on me
