[00:13.15]
[00:15.29]There's an army on the dance floor
[00:19.04]It's a fashion with a gun, my love
[00:23.13]In a room without a door
[00:27.00]A kiss is not enough in
[00:29.75]
[00:32.80]Love my way, It's a new road
[00:40.68]I follow where my mind goes
[00:45.97]
[00:46.30]They'd put us on a railroad
[00:49.92]They'd dearly make us pay
[00:53.91]For laughing in their faces
[00:57.78]And making it our way
[01:01.81]There's emptiness behind their eyes
[01:05.19]There's dust in all their hearts
[01:09.25]They just want to steal us all
[01:13.16]And take us all apart
[01:15.88]But not in
[01:17.48]
[01:19.04]Love my way, it's a new road
[01:27.08]I follow where my mind goes
[01:34.00]Love my way, it's a new road
[01:41.83]I follow where my mind goes
[01:49.78]
[02:05.34]Love my way, it's a new road
[02:12.70]I follow where my mind goes
[02:18.57]
[02:18.97]Swallow all your tears my love
[02:22.01]And put on your new face
[02:26.22]You can never win or lose
[02:29.98]If you don't run the race
[02:32.92]
[03:10.81]End
[03:22.41]
