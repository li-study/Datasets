[00:06.19]\"Where Did My Baby Go\"
[00:07.62]
[00:10.20]Where did my baby go?
[00:14.29]I wonder where she ran off to
[00:17.59]I miss my baby so
[00:21.94]I\'m calling but I can\'t get through
[00:26.14]Please tell that girl if you meet her
[00:31.69]That someone\'s longing to see her
[00:35.77]Where did my baby go?
[00:38.64]I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
[00:44.24]
[00:45.30]I\'m searching for the lover I knew
[00:55.22]Have you seen her?
[00:58.39]Where did she go?
[00:59.91]Feels like I\'ve just lost my only friend
[01:05.12]Flames subsided, colors faded
[01:11.33]Love just got so complicated
[01:15.67]Wish that I could see her smile again
[01:19.32]So if you see her out there, tell her I\'m still here
[01:30.24]Waiting for the day when she will reappear
[01:37.95]
[01:38.25]Where did my baby go?
[01:42.37]I wonder where she ran off to
[01:45.64]I miss my baby so
[01:50.11]I\'m calling but I can\'t get through
[01:54.27]Please tell that girl if you meet her
[01:59.37]That someone\'s longing to see her
[02:03.77]Where did my baby go?
[02:06.41]I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
[02:10.94]
[02:12.32]Maybe I was wrong and I
[02:22.80]Ignored her for too long and I
[02:26.71]Didn\'t even notice when she slipped away
[02:34.78]Maybe while I lay fast asleep then
[02:39.95]Out into the night she creeps
[02:43.18]I\'ll leave the light on, so she\'ll come back someday
[02:48.58]So if you see her out there, tell her it\'s not fair
[02:57.62]That life\'s just not the same when she\'s not here
[03:06.05]
[03:06.59]Where did my baby go?
[03:10.59]I wonder where she ran off to
[03:15.58]I miss my baby so
[03:18.21]Just what am I supposed to do?
[03:21.83]Please tell that girl if you meet her
[03:27.21]That someone\'s longing to see her
[03:31.16]Where did my baby go?
[03:34.33]I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
[04:11.92]Where did my baby go?
[04:14.29]I wonder where she ran off to
[04:18.31]I miss my baby so
[04:21.96]Just what am I supposed to do?
[04:26.05]Please tell that girl if you meet her
[04:31.21]That someone\'s longing to see her
[04:35.33]Where did my baby go?
[04:38.37]I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)
