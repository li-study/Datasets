[00:05.94]I hear the drizzle of the rain
[00:11.64]Like a memory it falls
[00:17.69]Soft and warm continuing
[00:23.90]Tapping on my roof and walls.
[00:32.98]And from the shelter of my mind
[00:39.04]Through the window of my eyes
[00:45.20]I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
[00:51.48]To England where my heart lies.
[01:04.44]My mind's distracted and diffused
[01:10.22]My thoughts are many miles away
[01:16.47]They lie with you when you're asleep
[01:22.53]And kiss you when you start your day.
[01:29.26]And a song I was writing is left undone
[01:35.56]I don't know why I spend my time
[01:41.99]Writing songs I can't believe
[01:47.84]With words that tear and strain to rhyme.
[02:02.73]And so you see I have come to doubt
[02:09.13]All that I once held as true
[02:15.05]I stand alone without beliefs
[02:21.45]The only truth I know is you.
[02:30.04]And as I watch the drops of rain
[02:36.30]Weave their weary paths and die
[02:42.36]I know that I am like the rain
[02:49.07]There but for the grace of you go I.
