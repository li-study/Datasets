[00:12.59]Little angels
[00:15.11]Whisper softly
[00:18.23]While my heart melts
[00:21.12]For you and I'll see
[00:24.06]Only sunshine
[00:26.94]Only moonlight
[00:29.88]For the first time its real
[00:35.15]And the higher you take me
[00:39.37]The more that you make me
[00:42.35]Feel so hazy
[00:44.92]Tell me what this means
[00:47.42]I got jet lag and I never even left the ground
[00:53.18]See it's like that every time you come around
[00:58.03]Oh, I'm so hung over and I never even touched a drop
[01:03.89]See I can't get enough
[01:07.21]This must be love (jet lag jet lag)
[01:11.29]How the time flies
[01:13.93]When you're near me
[01:16.71]Get those butterflies
[01:19.76]Inside and I'll be
[01:22.36]Where the stars shine
[01:25.56]Where the birds fly
[01:28.46]'Till the next time you're mine
[01:33.93]And the higher you take me
[01:37.91]The more that you make me
[01:40.76]Feel so hazy

[02:12.56]It feels like gravity
[02:15.15]Ain't got no hold on me
[02:18.55]Tell me what does this mean
[02:26.31]This must be love
[02:30.63]Love ...
