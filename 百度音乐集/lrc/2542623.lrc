[00:10.76]
[00:13.95]Late at night when all the world is sleeping
[00:19.79]I stay up late and think of you
[00:25.37]and I wish on a star
[00:28.16]That somewhere you are thinking of me too
[00:36.49]'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
[00:41.84]'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
[00:47.92]And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
[00:55.40]Than here in my room dreaming about you and me
[01:07.47]Wonder if you ever see me
[01:12.06]and I wonder if you know I'm there (Am I there)
[01:18.84]If you looked in my eyes would you see what's inside
[01:23.83]Would you even care
[01:30.74]I just wanna hold you close but so far
[01:36.59]All I have are dreams of you
[01:41.91]So I wait for the day and the courage to say
[01:47.16]How much I love you (Yes I'll do)
[01:53.32]I'll be dreaming of you tonight
[01:58.69]'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
[02:04.87]And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
[02:12.23]Than here in my room dreaming about you and me
[02:23.63]Ahh-Ahh
[02:28.01]I can't stop dreaming of you
[02:33.74]I can't stop dreaming
[02:39.55]I can't stop dreaming of you
[02:46.07]Late at night when all the world is sleeping
[02:51.63]I stay up and think of you
[02:57.15]And I still can't believe
[03:00.28]That you came up to me and said
[03:03.45]I love you
[03:06.12]I love you too
[03:08.37]I'll be dreaming with you tonight
[03:13.85]'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
[03:44.66][03:19.97]And there's nowhere in the world l'd rather be
[03:52.23][03:27.48]Than here in my room dreaming with you endlessly...
[03:38.46]With you tonight
