[00:34.24]
[00:36.49]You'll go and i`ll be okay,
[00:38.53]I can dream the rest away.
[00:40.81]Its just a little touch of fate
[00:43.33]it will be okay.
[00:44.95]It sure takes its precious time
[00:46.92]but it`s got rights and so have i.
[00:50.76]
[00:53.16]I turn my head up to the sky
[00:55.25]I focus one thought at a time
[00:57.45]I do not let the little thieves
[00:59.93]under my tightly buttoned sleeves
[01:01.98]You couldn`t be alone
[01:03.71]the time i feel like i am walking blind
[01:06.37]I have nowhere, i`ll have time
[01:08.38]There are no legible signs
[01:12.54]There are no legible signs
[01:29.03]
[01:35.56]I like the way that you talk,
[01:37.63]I like the way that you walk.
[01:39.87]It`s hard to recreate such an individual game
[01:44.21]You wait your turn in the queue,
[01:46.47]You say your sorry's and thank you`s.
[01:48.90]I don`t think you`re ever
[01:50.47]A hundred percent in the room
[01:55.53]You`re not in the room
[01:59.65]You`re not in the room
[02:07.16]
[02:34.90]Deepest, of the dark nights
[02:37.04]Here lies, the highest of highs
[02:39.33]Neopolitan dreams
[02:42.12]stretching out to the sea
[02:44.20]You wait your turn in the queue,
[02:46.21]You say your sorry's and thank you's
[02:48.52]I don`t think you`re ever
[02:50.11]A hundred percent in the room
[02:55.17]You`re not in the room
[02:59.58]You`re not in the room
[03:07.55]
