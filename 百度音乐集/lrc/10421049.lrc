[00:21.90]Mojo Pin Lyrics
[00:23.36]Artist: Jeff Buckley
[00:24.85]Album: Grace
[00:26.18]
[00:28.37](J. Buckley/G. Lucas)
[00:28.98]
[00:53.55]I'm lying in my bed
[00:55.51]The blanket is warm
[00:57.42]This body will never be safe from harm
[01:01.63]Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
[01:05.90]Touch my skin to keep me whole
[01:11.72]
[01:21.51]If only you'd come back to me
[01:25.73]If you laid at my side
[01:30.06]Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin to keep me satisfied
[01:40.79]
[01:42.95]Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
[01:49.28]I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
[01:55.64]The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
[02:07.61]Black beauty I love you so
[02:35.44]Precious, precious silver and gold and pearls
[02:41.11]in oyster's flesh
[02:43.59]Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
[02:51.87]Born again from the rhythm screaming down from heaven
[03:00.79]Ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms
[03:11.64]
[03:13.13]Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
[03:19.56]I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
[03:25.80]The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
[03:37.81]Black beauty I love you so
[03:54.21]
[04:19.99]The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
[04:23.75]Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
[04:27.78]Well it's you I've waited my life to see
[04:32.64]It's you I've searched so hard for
[04:36.84]
[04:40.79]Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
[04:47.40]I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
[04:54.17]The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
[04:59.75]Black beauty I love you so
[05:29.20]
