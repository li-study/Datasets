[00:02.16]Mariah Carey
[00:03.02]
[00:24.04]Oh baby
[00:26.64]Baby I stay in love with you
[00:29.93]Dying inside cause I can't stand it
[00:33.54]Make or break up
[00:34.85]Can't take this madness
[00:37.56]We don't even really know why
[00:39.45]All I know is baby
[00:40.52]I try and try so hard
[00:42.82]To keep our love alive
[00:44.72]If you dont' know me at this point
[00:45.99]Then I highly doubt you ever will
[00:48.27]I really need you to give me
[00:49.75]That unconditional love I used to feel
[00:52.05]It's no mistaking
[00:54.15]We're just erasing
[00:55.77]From our hearts and minds
[00:58.66]And I know we said let go
[01:00.57]But I kept on hanging on
[01:03.01]Inside I know it's over
[01:05.51]You're really gone
[01:06.63]It's killing me
[01:07.91]Cause there ain't nothing
[01:09.56]That I can do
[01:10.89]Baby  I stay in love with you
[01:14.43]And I keep on telling myself
[01:16.33]That you'll come back around
[01:18.38]And I try to front like Oh well
[01:19.99]Each time you let me down
[01:21.86]See I can't get over you now
[01:23.70]No matter what I do
[01:25.48]But baby  baby
[01:26.79]I stay in love with you

[01:40.54]Baby, I stay in love with you
[01:43.54]It cuts so deep
[01:45.25]It hurts down to my soul
[01:47.09]My friends tell me
[01:48.81]I ain't the same no more
[01:50.62]We still need each other
[01:52.48]When we stumble and fall
[01:54.10]How we gon' act
[01:55.56]Like what we had
[01:56.65]Ain't nothin' at all now
[01:58.25]Hey  what I wanna do is
[01:59.90]Ride shotgun next to you
[02:01.46]With the top down like we used to
[02:03.50]Hit the block
[02:04.22]Proud in the SUV
[02:06.04]Now We both know our heart is breaking
[02:07.74]Can we learn from our mistakes
[02:09.63]I can't last one moment alone
[02:12.09]Now go I know
[02:13.24]We said let go
[02:14.41]But I kept on hanging on
[02:16.88]Inside I know it's over

[02:20.55]It's killing me
[02:21.79]Cause there ain't nothing
[02:23.34]That I can do
[02:24.68]Baby I stay in love with you
[02:28.18]And I keep on telling myself
[02:30.12]That you'll come back around
