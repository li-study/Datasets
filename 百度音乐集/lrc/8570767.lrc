[00:02.87]Matt Nathanson-All We Are
[00:09.26]
[00:12.51]I tasted, tasted love so sweet
[00:17.35]and all of it was lost on me
[00:21.50]bought and sold like property
[00:25.68]sugar on my tongue
[00:29.85]
[00:30.50]I kept falling over
[00:34.41]I kept looking backward
[00:39.03]I went broke believing
[00:43.13]that the simple should be hard
[00:46.93]
[00:48.03]all we are we are
[00:51.69]all we are we are
[00:56.33]and every day is a start of something beautiful
[01:03.79]
[01:13.72]I wasted, wasted love for you
[01:18.44]trading out for something new
[01:21.94]well, it's hard to change the way you lose
[01:26.68]if you think you've never won
[01:29.98]
[01:31.46]cause all we are we are
[01:35.57]all we are we are
[01:39.97]and every day is a start of something beautiful
[01:46.38]
[01:49.81]and in the end the words won't matter
[01:58.30]cause in the end nothing stays the same
[02:07.20]and in the end dreams just scatter and fall like rain
[02:15.69]
[02:32.36]cause all we are we are
[02:36.34]all we are we are
[02:40.93]and every day is a start of something beautiful, something real
[02:49.29]
[02:49.83]all we are we are
[02:54.20]all we are we are
[02:58.61]and every day is a start of something beautiful, beautiful
