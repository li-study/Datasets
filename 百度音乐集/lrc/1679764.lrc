[00:00.53]Mushaboom
[00:02.51]Feist
[00:03.89]
[00:05.73]Helping the kids out of their coats
[00:08.24]But wait the babies haven't been born
[00:16.02]Unpacking the bags and setting up
[00:19.04]And planting lilacs and buttercups
[00:25.14]
[00:27.14]But in the meantime I've got it hard
[00:30.05]Second floor living without a yard
[00:35.31]It may be years until the day
[00:37.84]My dreams will match up with my pay
[00:41.83]
[00:43.57]Old dirt road Knee deep snow
[00:51.63]Watching the fire as we grow old
[01:10.76]
[01:24.17]I got a man to stick it out
[01:26.68]And make a home from a rented house
[01:34.48]And we'll collect the moments one by one
[01:37.52]I guess that's how the future's done
[01:42.41]
[01:45.65]How many acres how much light
[01:48.51]Tucked in the woods and out of sight
[01:53.92]Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
[01:56.12]On a little road barely on the map
[02:00.64]
[02:02.06]Old dirt road Knee deep snow
[02:10.24]Watching the fire as we grow old
[02:18.21]Old dirt road Rambling rose
[02:26.30]Watching the fire as we grow well I'm sold
