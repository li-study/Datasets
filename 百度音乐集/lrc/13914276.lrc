[00:02.95]When there is love, I can't wait to talk about it
[00:08.69]When things get rough, I like to walk with you
[00:14.32]Or when it's night, I like to be the light that's missing
[00:20.91]And remind you every minute of the future isn't written
[00:26.68]Not yet
[00:28.11]
[00:37.70]When there is love
[00:40.45]or when the heart feels heavy.We can lighten it up
[00:43.44]if you've had enough
[00:46.16]Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up
[00:49.45]You know it's up to us to make it all up
[00:53.74]So what you making up? I can make it up back
[00:57.39]You could be loved no matter what
[01:01.36]And know the only time is right now, it's right well where you are
[01:07.24]You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from
[01:12.63]Singing.La la la la
[01:18.80]Let's all sing.La la la la Laying it down
[01:23.46]Everything is sound
[01:25.27]Let's sing to be happy, to feel things, to communicate, and be heard
[01:31.29]Or sing out to protest, and to protect, and to harmonize with birds
[01:36.90]Whether it's your birthday, or your dying day
[01:40.62]It's a celebration too
[01:42.68]Rejoice to use your voice, and give wings to any your choice
[01:48.06]Whatever you're choosing right now, it's right well where you are
[01:53.46]You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from
[01:58.82]
[01:59.14]Set your vibration and undulation to the hightest it can go
[02:05.14]And trust me, hear me
[02:07.91]If it makes you wanna sing
[02:10.14]Just sing it

[02:32.54]
[02:33.80]It's a song that I've forgotten often
[02:41.88]It doesn't make me wrong
[02:43.62]Cause we all need the darkness, to see the light
[02:50.73]And now we're on rise, come on, and sing it
