[00:58.86]Madness in his head, his heart's filled by the rage
[01:02.62]Cause his wife has been taken by the plague
[01:05.69]of the devil who darkened his holy soul
[01:08.49]Return for the way to save her
[01:11.16]Gaining power by the corpses he wakes
[01:15.94]Blood is flowing while hope is growing
[01:21.66]Reason and faith fade away
[01:25.95]He lives his nights like his days
[01:31.79]Graveyards are quickly empty
[01:37.27]But the undead are ugly

[02:40.87]There's always some hope, Lord, send me a sign
[02:46.44]He could have managed to rule all the world
[02:52.14]Love blinds his mind, he wants her by his side
[02:57.51]Now's the time to try to reopen her eyes
[03:03.37]There's always some hope, Lord, send me a sign
[03:08.70]Her soul may be lost, but love never dies
[03:15.14]Trading a life, some useful sacrifice
[03:20.93]Trusting the fire can turn hope in ice
[03:26.46]
[03:32.17]From every crypt, every tomb, quakes this dark fury
[03:36.15]The gate of shadows are now opened
[03:39.14]All the undead running towards their master
[03:42.52]This hopeless and now disarmed necromancer
[03:45.79]Fleeing can save everything but all seems to be lost
[03:50.34]He runs, he's lost, forever
[03:59.89]Suddenly he feels in his veins the power of life
[04:03.27]His will is not bad, the sky not spiteful
[04:06.33]All the undead running towards their Father
[04:09.90]This reborned mind, brightened by angel's glance
[04:13.52]Feelings can save everything, even when there's no hope
[04:17.87]He wins, he loves, forever
