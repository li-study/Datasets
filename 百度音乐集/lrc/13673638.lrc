[00:13.37] You can spend your whole life buildin'
[00:18.27] something from nothing
[00:22.00] One storm could come and blow it all away
[00:27.27] Build it anyway
[00:35.86] You could chase a dream
[00:38.87] That seems so out of reach
[00:42.21] And you know it might not ever come your way
[00:47.81] Dream it anyway
[02:05.80][00:55.78] God is great
[02:08.97][00:58.98] but sometimes life ain't good
[02:11.99][01:02.92] And when I pray
[02:15.10][01:06.78] It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
[02:20.07][01:12.01] But I do it anyway
[02:27.16][01:19.81] I do it anyway
[01:28.25] This world's gone crazy
[01:30.01] And it's hard to believe
[01:34.03] That tomorrow will be better than today
[01:40.46] Believe it anyway
[01:44.76] You can love someone with all you heart
[01:47.61] For all the right reasons
[01:51.21] And in a momemt they can choose to walk away
[01:58.00] Love 'em anyway

[03:04.28] You can pour your soul out singin'
[03:08.27] A song you believe in
[03:12.42] That tomorrow they'll forget you ever sang
[03:18.65] Sing it anyway
[03:25.42] Yeah sing it anyway
[03:33.12] I sing
[03:36.72] I dream
[03:38.72] I love
[03:47.12] Anyway
