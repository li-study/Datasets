[00:11.79]Step into the window/ What about the sun?
[00:18.31]Follow me outside/ When rain's are coming down?
[00:23.72]I don't have the reasons/ Can we chase the wind?
[00:29.42]If we feel inclined
[00:34.00]

[01:42.60]
[01:53.85]You and I standing here throwing pebbles in the water
[02:01.04]As they fall watch the circles growing farther and farther
[02:08.16]To no end like Daddy said, they carry on into Forever
