[05:55.13]Beauty's Confusion - Silhouette
[05:55.63]鹰飞雁武 编辑
[05:55.93]
[00:00.50]Covering
[00:02.50]Cowering
[00:04.39]In the corner
[00:05.90]Of this room
[00:07.78]Unnerved
[00:09.67]Reserved
[00:11.46]Deserving
[00:12.96]This solitude
[00:15.26]Wasting
[00:16.94]Tasting
[00:19.04]Rejection
[00:20.43]Once again
[00:22.43]Trying
[00:24.13]To stop crying
[00:26.12]I knew
[00:27.92]It would end
[00:30.10]I don't wanna try anymore
[00:36.50]To be noticed
[00:45.37]If it all ends the same way
[00:51.06]Why even bother trying
[01:00.64]You're the last one who will hurt me
[01:05.92]I won't forget
[01:14.90]I'll disappear into the background
[01:20.79]I'll become a silhouette
[01:29.16]Giving up and giving in
[01:37.64]Is there any other way
[01:44.13]Losing hope
[01:47.62]Losing you
[01:51.81]I'll lose it all someday
[01:55.90]Someday, someday
[01:59.59]Maybe this is not so bad
[02:04.88]Being alone
[02:14.26]Staring at the walls for hours
[02:19.95]Disconnect the telephone
[02:28.33]But you don't cross my mind at all
[02:34.80]I'm alright
[02:43.88]Inscribe these words into my head
[02:49.47]Every night
[02:53.26]What a lie
[02:57.85]Giving up and giving in
[03:06.13]Is there any other way
[03:12.71]Losing hope, losing you
[03:20.51]I'll lose it all someday
[03:26.57]
[03:57.36]I can't explain it to you
[04:02.96]My heart is open like a book
[04:07.54]Why won't you take a look
[04:13.03]I feel like a fool
[04:18.71]A shadow in the midst
[04:22.60]Which you won't even miss
[04:26.39]I don't want to try anymore to be seen
[04:41.15]I'm invisible anyway
[04:47.24]I'm nobody's dream
[04:56.92]You're the last one who will kiss me
[05:02.30]I can't forget
[05:11.28]I've disappeared into the distance
[05:17.17]I've become a silhouette
[05:26.05]I've disappeared
[05:31.93]Into the distance
[05:40.91]I've disappeared
[05:46.57]Into the distance
[05:51.94]I've disapp.
