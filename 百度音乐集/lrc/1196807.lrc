[00:39.00]Once upon a time
[00:41.00]Not so long ago
[00:46.00]Tommy used to work on the docks
[00:50.00]Union's been on strike
[00:52.00]He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough
[01:02.00]Gina works the diner all day
[01:06.00]Working for her man, she brings home her pay
[01:10.00]For love - for love
[01:17.00]She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
[01:21.00]'Cause it doesn't make a difference
[01:23.00]If we make it or not
[01:25.00]We've got each other and that's a lot
[01:29.00]For love - we'll give it a shot
[01:35.00]We're half way there
[01:39.00]Livin' on a prayer
[01:41.00]Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
[01:45.00]Livin' on a prayer
[01:53.00]Tommy got his six string in hock
[01:57.00]Now he's holding in what he used
[02:00.00]To make it talk - so tough, it's tough
[02:09.00]Gina dreams of running away
[02:12.00]When she cries in the night
[02:14.00]Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay, someday
[02:24.00]We've got to hold on to what we've got
[02:28.00]'Cause it doesn't make a difference
[02:30.00]If we make it or not
[02:32.00]We've got each other and that's a lot
[02:36.00]For love - we'll give it a shot
[02:42.00]We're half way there
[02:45.00]Livin' on a prayer
[02:48.00]Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
[02:52.00]Livin' on a prayer
[03:16.00]We've got to hold on ready or not
[03:21.00]You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
[03:26.00]We're half way there
[03:30.00]Livin' on a prayer
[03:32.00]Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
[03:38.00]Livin' on a prayer
[03:42.00]We're half way there
[03:45.00]Livin' on a prayer
[03:48.00]Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
[03:53.00]Livin' on a prayer
[03:57.00]We're half way there
[04:01.00]Livin' on a prayer
[04:03.00]Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
[04:08.00]Livin' on a prayer
