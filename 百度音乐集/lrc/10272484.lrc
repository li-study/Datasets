[00:00.00]Snow Patrol - Chocolate
[00:07.70]By Stoneage
[00:28.07]This could be the very minute
[00:32.08]I'm aware I'm alive
[00:36.14]All these places feel like home
[00:44.20]With a name I'd never chosen
[00:48.33]I can make my first steps
[00:52.39]As a child of 25
[00:57.52]This is the straw, final straw in the
[01:05.58]Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
[01:13.71]Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
[01:21.71]I didn't enjoy it at the time
[01:47.21]You're the only thing that I love
[01:51.28]It scares me more every day
[01:55.34]On my knees I think clearer
[02:03.47]Goodness knows I saw it coming
[02:07.53]Or at least I'll claim I did
[02:11.59]But in truth I'm lost for words
[02:16.72]What have I done it's too late for that
[02:24.66]What have I become truth is nothing yet
[02:32.72]A simple mistake starts the hardest time
[02:40.85]I promise I'll do anything you ask...this time
