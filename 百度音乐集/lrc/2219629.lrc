[00:00.00]Ash - Burn Out
[00:05.00]
[01:25.91][00:10.86]Rising in the east
[01:28.09][00:14.23]And fading in the west
[01:31.98][00:17.11]To the north and to sleep
[01:34.52][00:20.45]At the close of day
[01:37.65][00:23.76]The flame goes out
[01:40.39][00:26.05]Only char left in the grate
[01:43.93][00:29.10]Do you in dying become
[01:47.72][00:34.01]But a name
[00:36.28]I can see you're worn down
[00:39.27]The weight upon your shoulders
[00:42.17]All the joy you once had
[00:45.19]Now is gone
[00:48.60]Can't find what you wanted
[00:51.35]Feeling lost in turmoil
[00:54.53]Will you finally
[00:58.97]Be free
[03:26.99][03:02.68][02:14.58][01:50.23][01:01.29]Out into the cold night
[03:29.78][03:05.77][02:17.20][01:53.00][01:03.82]Stare into the dark sky
[03:32.83][03:08.67][02:20.02][01:56.00][01:06.98]Do you sleep forever
[03:35.81][03:11.76][02:23.07][01:59.03][01:10.16]Or burn alive
[03:38.48][03:14.56][02:25.88][02:01.88][01:13.21]Or linger in the half light
[03:41.77][03:17.60][02:28.97][02:05.07][01:16.06]Fade into the dark night
[03:44.79][03:20.83][02:32.22][02:08.11][01:19.07]Do you find contentment
[03:47.71][03:23.87][02:35.03][02:11.12][01:22.43]Do you find your peace
[03:51.58][02:40.37]
