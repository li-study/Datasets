[00:17.55]She can't see the landscape anymore
[00:22.55]It's all painted in her grief
[00:26.62]All of her history etched out at her feet
[00:33.65]Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
[00:42.62]Echoes and warning, mountains of tenderness
[00:50.23]Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
[00:57.40]Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
[01:06.56]Cause it's burning through the bloodline
[01:10.49]it's coming down the family tree
[01:14.56]Rolling in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
[01:22.32]
[01:30.80]She wants the silence but fears the solitude
[01:38.40]She wants to be alone and together with you
[01:45.77]So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
[01:54.47]She's sober at the lighthouse and then washed out to sea
[02:02.08]Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
[02:09.58]Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
[02:18.39]Cause it's burning through the bloodline
[02:22.23]it's coming down the family tree
[02:26.28]Rolling in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
[02:34.30]I wanna give you back the open sky
[02:38.82]Give you back the open sea
[02:42.52]Open up the ages, darling, for you to see
[02:49.42]
[02:51.15]You put the gun into your mouth to die
[02:55.18]You put the lid and spit out
[02:58.28]Cause it's running in the family
[03:01.06]Oh the rich and
[03:06.86]Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
[03:13.66]Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
[03:22.31]Cause it's burning through the bloodline
[03:26.05]it's coming down the family tree
[03:30.80]Rolling in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
