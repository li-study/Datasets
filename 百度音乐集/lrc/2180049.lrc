[00:00.00]Tears And Rain Lyrics
[00:23.04]How I wish I could surrender my soul;
[00:34.48]Shed the clothes that become my skin;
[00:37.32]See the liar that burns within my needing.
[00:45.72]How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
[00:56.99]How I wish I had screamed out loud,
[00:59.50]Instead I've found no meaning.
[01:05.49]I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
[01:14.24]All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
[01:19.84]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[01:25.61]I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
[01:30.60]It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.
[01:42.13]How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
[01:53.33]Hold memory close at hand,
[01:56.17]Help me understand the years.
[02:04.72]How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
[02:16.04]How I wish I would save my soul.
[02:19.34]I'm so cold from fear.
[02:24.58]I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
[02:33.21]All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
[02:38.85]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[02:44.61]I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
[02:50.17]Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
[02:55.82]All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
[03:01.02]It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain
[03:12.25]Ah...Ah...tears and rain...
[03:21.56]Ah...Ah...tears and rain...
[03:35.38]Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
[03:41.29]All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
[03:46.16]It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain
