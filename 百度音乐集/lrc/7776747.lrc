[00:12.14]Music: Kevin Moore
[00:14.77]
[01:23.77]Falling through pages of Martens on angels
[01:28.51]Feeling my heart pull west
[01:33.56]I saw the future dressed as a stranger
[01:37.87]Love in a space-dye vest
[01:40.70]
[01:42.71]Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
[01:47.35]A pool in the shape of a heart
[01:52.08]Beauty projection in the reflection
[01:56.72]Always the worst way to start
[01:59.39]
[02:04.60]<Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".>
[02:04.89]"But he's the sort who can't know
[02:06.42]anyone intimately, least of all a woman.
[02:09.59]He doesn't know what a woman is.
[02:13.06]He wants you for a possession,
[02:14.66]something to look at like a painting or an ivory box.
[02:18.95]Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real,
[02:23.55]or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you.
[02:27.84]I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and
[02:32.09]feelings, even when
[02:33.25]I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our last chance..."
[02:38.15]
[02:39.24]Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
[02:43.80]Learning to swallow the rage
[02:48.53]Found a new girl I think we can make it
[02:53.25]As long as she stays on the page
[02:56.37]
[02:59.64]This is not how I want it to end
[03:09.03]And I'll never be open again
[03:13.57]
[03:18.38]<Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".>
[03:19.86]"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,
[03:22.05]get a job, get my own place, ummm,
[03:25.98]but... I go into the mall where I
[03:28.45]want to work and they tell me, I'm,
[03:31.16]I was too young..."
[03:31.92]
[03:32.14]<Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.>
[03:32.45]"Some people, gave advice before,
[03:33.51]about facing the facts, about
[03:34.82]facing reality. And this is, this
[03:36.39]without a doubt, is his biggest
[03:38.01]challenge ever. He's going to have to face it.
[03:41.38]You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and,
[03:43.79]uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can
[03:47.14]say they know how he feels."
[03:47.88]
[03:48.24]<Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.>
[03:48.45]"That, so they say that, in ya know
[03:49.74]like, Houston or something, you'd
[03:51.38]say it's a hundred and eighty degrees,
[03:52.11]but it's a dry heat.
[03:52.77]In Houston they say that?
[03:54.12]Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.
[03:56.27]Dry until they hit the swimming pool."
[03:57.90]
[03:59.21]<Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".>
[04:04.85]"...I get up with the sun... Listen.
[04:07.66]You have your own room to sleep in,
[04:10.50]I don't care what you do. I don't
[04:11.08]care when. That door gets locked,
[04:14.18]that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock.
[04:20.50]If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd
[04:23.99]better find some
[04:24.99]place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in
[04:28.05]this house.
[04:29.50]Supper is ready..."
[04:30.89]
[04:32.24]There's no one to take my blame
[04:36.25]If they wanted to
[04:41.29]There's nothing to keep me sane
[04:45.54]And it's all the same to you
[04:50.74]There's nowhere to set my aim
[04:55.04]So I'm everywhere
[05:00.40]Never come near me again
[05:04.34]Do you really think I need you
[05:08.22]
[05:09.93]I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
[05:18.99]I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
[05:27.11]
[05:30.37]And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
[05:39.55]And I'll never be open again
[05:49.05]And I'll have no more dreams to defend
[05:58.44]And I'll never be open again
[06:02.22]
