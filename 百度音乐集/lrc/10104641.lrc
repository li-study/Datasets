[00:31.14]Hold on to love. That is what I do,
[00:40.71]Now that I've found you.
[00:46.36]And from above, everything's stinking,
[00:55.95]They r not around you.
[01:00.64]And in the night, I could be helpless
[01:07.38]I could be lonely, sleeping without you.
[01:15.92]And in the day, everything's complex
[01:22.78]There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you.
[01:30.78]But, I miss you when you're gone.
[01:38.06]That is what I do, Bay, Bay, Bay
[01:46.43]And it's going to carry on,
[01:53.35]That is what I knew, Bay, Bay, Bay
[02:18.65]Hold on to my hands,
[02:24.12]I feel me sinking, sinking without you.
[02:33.43]And to my mind, everything's stinking
[02:43.06]Stinking without you.
[02:48.36]And I miss you when you're gone.
[02:55.49]That is what I do, Bay, Bay, Bay
[03:03.84]And it's going to carry on,
[03:10.91]That is what I do, Bay, Bay, Bay
