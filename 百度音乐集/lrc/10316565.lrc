[00:01.02]Meditation
[00:04.35]Olivia Ong
[00:08.57]
[00:16.95]In my loneliness
[00:23.97]When you're gone and I'm all by muself
[00:28.06]And I need your caress
[00:32.15]I just think of you
[00:39.45]And the thought of you holding me near
[00:42.98]Makes my loneliness soon disappear
[00:47.47]Though you're far away
[00:54.41]I have only to close my eyes
[00:58.63]And you are back to stay
[01:02.55]I just close my eyes
[01:09.64]And the sadness that missing you brings
[01:13.42]Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
[01:17.77]Yes I love you so
[01:24.81]And that for me is all I need to know
[01:33.05]I will wait for you
[01:40.25]Till the sun falls from out of the sky
[01:44.24]For what else can I do
[01:48.34]I will wait for you meditating
[01:56.48]How sweet life will be
[01:58.50]When you come back to me
[02:01.65]
[03:04.53]Yes I love you so
[03:11.60]And that for me is all I need to know
[03:19.72]I will wait for you
[03:26.76]Till the sun falls from out of the sky
[03:30.92]For what else can I do
[03:34.85]I will wait for you meditating
[03:43.50]How sweet life will be
[03:45.15]When you come back to me
