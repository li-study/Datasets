[00:13.36]She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
[00:17.14]On a snow white Christmas Eve
[00:20.75]Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
[00:25.42]Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
[00:32.01]It's been a long hard year
[00:35.42]She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
[00:38.69]She was going way to fast
[00:42.34]Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
[00:48.07]She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
[00:51.82]She didn't even have time to cry
[00:54.40]She was sooo scared
[00:57.91]She threw her hands up in the air
[01:02.21]Jesus take the wheel
[01:05.46]Take it from my hands
[01:08.62]Cause I can't do this all on my own
[01:14.09]I'm letting go
[01:16.66]So give me one more chance
[01:20.65]To save me from this road I'm on
[01:27.47]Jesus take the wheel
[01:41.38]It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
[01:45.10]And the car came to a stop
[01:47.93]She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
[01:54.08]And for the first time in a long time
[01:57.68]She bowed her head to pray
[02:00.95]She said I'm sorry for the way
[02:04.07]I've been living my life
[02:07.54]I know I've got to change
[02:10.28]So from now on tonight
[02:14.82]Jesus take the wheel
[02:18.08]Take it from my hands
[02:21.16]Cause I can't do this on my own
[02:26.43]I'm letting go
[02:29.03]So give me one more chance
[02:32.21]To save me from this road I'm on
[02:39.41]Oh, Jesus take the wheel
[02:52.90]Oh, I'm letting go
[02:56.08]So give me one more chance
[02:59.25]Save me from this road I'm on
[03:05.13]From this road I'm on
[03:11.74]Jesus take the wheel
[03:18.95]Oh, take it, take it from me
[03:24.53]Oh, why, oh
