[01:23.70][00:09.66]Underneath the bridge
[01:29.06][00:12.59]The tarp has sprung a leak
[01:32.73][00:17.64]And the animals I've trapped
[01:36.77][00:21.90]Have all become my pets
[01:41.16][00:26.21]And I'm living off of grass
[01:45.28][00:30.78]And the drippings from the ceiling
[01:50.98][00:36.13]But it's ok to eat fish
[01:54.71][00:39.51]Cause they haven't any feelings
[02:54.46][02:36.28][02:18.48][02:00.52][01:03.64][00:45.46]Something in the way
[03:07.95][02:58.88][02:50.76][02:40.82][02:31.94][02:22.92][02:17.06][02:04.43][01:17.06][01:08.18][01:00.06][00:50.06]Ummmmm
[03:03.31][02:45.35][02:27.50][02:09.44][01:12.50][00:54.57]Something in the way, yea
