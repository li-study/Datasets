[00:04.79]In times of loneliness
[00:07.55]when I feel like giving
[00:10.00]everything I own in my life
[00:14.78]in exchange for a moment or two
[00:18.20]just having you by my side
[00:24.12]in times of desperation
[00:26.72]when all could do is holding on
[00:30.07]to what’s left of you
[00:33.56]just thought of you
[00:36.12]will always be true
[00:38.23]you’re the best thing in my life
[00:43.58]
[00:45.19]they say that love comes easy
[00:47.93]as the love that goes
[00:50.25]with the hours of the night
[00:54.89]well you mornings were
[00:57.00]always filled with
[00:59.26]loving still in our eyes
[01:03.86]you see I’m lost
[01:06.84]I’m hopelessly
[01:08.80]lost inside my mind all because of you
[01:13.57]just the thought of you
[01:16.92]will always be true
[01:18.57]you’re the best thing in my life
[01:24.05]and when the morning comes
[01:27.66]andthe sun refuses to rise
[01:34.65]and the night goes on
[01:37.18]without a star in the sky
[01:42.54]I’ll still be missing you
[01:45.89]til the very day that I die
[01:52.18]taking with me all the pain and mistery
[01:58.01]forgotten sings and memories of you
[02:04.06]if you could see me and hear the words
[02:07.70]I wanted to say
[02:11.28]with you I lived a lifetime
[02:15.24]without you can’t face another day
[02:19.87]if I could see you
[02:22.69]if only I could tell you
[02:24.71]just how much I really love you
[02:29.25]just the thought of you
[02:31.99]will always be true
[02:33.77]you’re the best thing in my life
[02:40.63]you’re the best thing
[02:43.36]ever the very best in my life
[02:51.03]
