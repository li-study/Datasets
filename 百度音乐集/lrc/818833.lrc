[00:31.00]Though you say it isn't so
[00:42.00]But if you put me down for another
[00:51.00]I'll know, believe me, I'll know
[00:59.00]'cause the night has a thousand eyes
[01:08.00]And a thousand eyes can't help but see
[01:18.00]if you are true to me
[01:25.00]So remember when you tell those little white lies
[01:36.00]That the night has a thousand eyes
[02:00.00]'cause the night has a thousand eyes
[02:08.00]And a thousand eyes can't help but see
