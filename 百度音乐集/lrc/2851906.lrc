[00:12.79]Midnight,
[00:14.89]and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
[00:17.82]Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line
[00:24.14]Moonlight,
[00:26.05]you're just a heartache in disguise;
[00:29.10]Won't you keep my heart from breaking
[00:31.17]if it's only for a very short time
[00:33.54]CHORUS:
[00:34.85]Playing with the queen of hearts,
[00:37.16]knowing it ain't really smart
[00:40.02]The joker ain't the only fool
[00:42.78]who'll do anything for you
[00:45.66]Laying out another lie,
[00:48.60]thinking 'bout a life of crime
[00:51.48]That's what I'll have to do
[00:54.81]to keep me away from you
[00:57.58]Honey, you know it makes you mad
[01:04.85]Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
[01:09.68]Baby, I know it makes you sad
[01:15.70]But when they're handing out the heartaches
[01:18.09]you know you got to have you some
[01:20.83]CHORUS:
[01:59.40]Lovers, I know you've had a few
[02:03.95]But hide your heart beneath the covers
[02:05.98]and tell 'em they're the only one
[02:09.61]And others, they know just what I'm going through
[02:15.47]And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun
[02:20.36]Playing with the queen of hearts,
[02:23.49]knowing it ain't really smart
[02:26.30]The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you
[02:32.36]CHORUS
[02:34.05]Playing with the queen of hearts
[02:38.48]
