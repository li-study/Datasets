[00:01.16]Bob Dylan - Masters of War
[00:02.73]
[00:03.07]Come you masters of war
[00:07.34]You that build all the guns
[00:11.58]You that build the death planes
[00:16.07]You that build the big bombs
[00:20.33]You that hide behind walls
[00:24.41]You that hide behind desks
[00:28.81]I just want you to know
[00:31.52]I can see through your masks
[00:34.29]
[00:35.57]You that never done nothin\'
[00:39.76]But build to destroy
[00:43.85]You play with my world
[00:47.86]Like it\'s your little toy
[00:52.56]You put a gun in my hand
[00:56.90]And you hide from my eyes
[01:01.07]And you turn and run farther
[01:04.74]When the fast bullets fly
[01:07.92]
[01:08.17]Like Judas of old
[01:11.71]You lie and deceive
[01:16.28]A world war can be won
[01:20.16]You want me to believe
[01:24.78]But I see through your eyes
[01:28.54]And I see through your brain
[01:33.32]Like I see through the water
[01:35.94]That runs down my drain
[01:38.60]
[01:44.20]You fasten the triggers
[01:48.23]For the others to fire
[01:52.54]Then you set back and watch
[01:56.29]When the death count gets higher
[02:00.82]You hide in your mansion
[02:05.24]As young people\'s blood
[02:07.80]Flows out of their bodies
[02:12.47]And is buried in the mud
[02:15.15]
[02:16.79]You\'ve thrown the worst fear
[02:20.66]That can ever be hurled
[02:24.73]Fear to bring children
[02:29.19]Into the world
[02:33.55]For threatening my baby
[02:37.72]Unborn and unnamed
[02:42.33]You ain\'t worth the blood
[02:45.02]That runs in your veins
[02:47.39]
[02:51.22]How much do I know
[02:55.49]To talk out of turn
[02:59.32]You might say that I\'m young
[03:03.63]You might say I\'m unlearned
[03:08.45]But there\'s one thing I know
[03:12.71]Though I\'m younger than you
[03:16.95]Even Jesus would never
[03:19.32]Forgive what you do
[03:21.49]
[03:23.88]Let me ask you one question
[03:27.86]Is your money that good
[03:31.63]Will it buy you forgiveness
[03:36.08]Do you think that it could
[03:40.66]I think you will find
[03:44.60]When your death takes its toll
[03:48.87]All the money you made
[03:51.63]Will never buy back your soul
[03:54.29]
[03:56.11]And I hope that you die
[04:00.27]And your death\'ll come soon
[04:04.03]I will follow your casket
[04:08.22]In the pale afternoon
[04:13.11]And I\'ll watch while you\'re lowered
[04:17.21]Down to your deathbed
[04:20.44]And I\'ll stand o\'er your grave
[04:24.28]\'Til I\'m sure that you\'re dead
[04:27.90]
