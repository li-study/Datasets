[00:36]I long for the warmth of days gone by
[00:45]When you were mine
[00:49]But now those days are memories in time
[00:55]Life抯 empty without you by my side
[01:05]My heart belongs to you
[01:08]No matter what I try
[01:14]When I get courage up to love somebody new
[01:18]It always falls apart 慶ause they just
[01:20]Can抰 compare to you
[01:23]You love won抰 release me
[01:25]I抦 bound under ball and chain
[01:28]Reminiscing our love as I watch four season抯 change
[03:56][02:58][01:34]In comes the winter breeze
[03:57][02:59][01:36]That chills the air and drifts the snow
[04:00][03:02][01:39]And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
[04:05][03:06][01:44]When springtime makes its way here
[04:07][03:09][01:46]Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
[04:15][03:16][01:53]When summer burns with heat
[04:18][03:18][01:55]I always get the hots for you
[04:19][03:21][01:58]Go skinny dippin?in the ocean where we used to do
[04:24][03:26][02:03]When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
[04:27][03:29][02:06]When you抮e not here it doesn抰 feel the same
[02:18]Remember the nights when we closed our eyes
[02:28]And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time
[02:36]Anytime I think about these things is shared with you
[02:41]I break down and cry 慶ause I get so emotional
[02:46]Until you release me I抦 bound under ball and chain
[02:51]Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change
[03:36]This loneliness
[03:38]Has crushed my heart
[03:41]Please let me love again
[03:45]慍ause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
[03:49]Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again
