[00:22.57]we still couldn't undersand what was in each others heads
[00:26.01]complete content some rised to sunset so fly like stars,
[00:30.19]you were everything i wish for
[00:33.57]but yet you made time to speak your mind
[00:36.57]if i wasn't pleasing you,
[00:37.90]took my love in vain
[00:39.53]i was bleeding only one night i held
[00:42.04]your pillow close wishin i was squezing you,
[00:43.54]it's crazy we can only see the bad times when were together
[00:46.67]and remeber the good when were apart
[00:48.66]if we throw our love away does that bring us back to the start
[00:51.54]time heals all wounds but i can't move
[00:54.43]my mouth is our flame not still their if seeing u it lights a spark.
