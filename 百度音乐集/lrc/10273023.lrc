[00:06.45]Mad about the boy
[00:09.87]It's pretty funny
[00:12.28]But I'm mad about the boy
[00:16.05]He has a gay appeal
[00:19.79]That makes me feel
[00:22.24]There's maybe something
[00:25.85]Sad about the boy
[00:29.52]
[00:32.95]Walkin' down the street
[00:35.39]His eyes look out at me
[00:39.77]From people that I meet
[00:42.85]I can't believe it's true
[00:46.90]But when I'm blue
[00:48.85]In some strange way
[00:52.34]I'm glad about the boy
[00:57.48]
[00:59.22]I'm hardly sentimental
[01:04.00]Love isn't so sublime
[01:11.11]I have to pay my rent
[01:16.29]And I can't afford to waste much time
[01:26.54]
[01:28.67]If I could employ
[01:32.57]A little magic
[01:34.95]That would finally destroy
[01:39.75]This dream than pains me
[01:43.41]And enchains me
[01:45.33]But I can't because
[01:50.25]I'm mad about the boy
[01:55.05]Mad about the boy
[02:01.88]
