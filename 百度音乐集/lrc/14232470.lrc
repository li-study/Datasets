[00:00.00]Regina Spektor - Samson
[00:06.55]You are my sweetest downfall
[00:14.22]I loved you first, I loved you first
[00:21.13]Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
[00:31.87]I have to go, I have to go
[00:38.65]Your hair was long when we first met
[00:50.24]Samson went back to bed
[00:53.60]Not much hair left on his head
[00:56.54]He ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed
[01:04.28]And history books forgot about us and the bible didn't mention us
[01:11.06]The bible didn't mention us, not even once
[01:23.28]You are my sweetest downfall
[01:32.04]I loved you first , I loved you first
[01:38.77]Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
[01:49.11]But there just soft light, there just soft light
[01:56.24]Your hair was long when we first met
[02:07.77]Samson came to my bed
[02:11.13]Told me that my hair was red
[02:14.28]He told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
[02:21.62]Oh I cut his hair myself one night
[02:25.01]A pair of dull scissors and the yellow light
[02:28.04]And he told me that I'd done alright
[02:30.71]and kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
[02:35.57]and he kissed me till the morning light
[02:57.80]Samson came back to bed
[03:01.18]not much hair left on his head
[03:04.16]Ate a slice of wonderbread and went right back to bed
[03:11.64]Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
[03:14.76]Yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
[03:17.95]And history books forgot about us
[03:21.23]And the bible didn't mention us, not even once
[03:34.17]You are my sweetest downfall
[03:42.68]I loved you first
