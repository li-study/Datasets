[00:14.01]Well it's not about them
[00:15.33]It's all about us
[00:16.71]Can you hear it again
[00:17.94]Or just take it on trust
[00:19.63]Yeah you still got a way to get out
[00:21.49]of this one story town
[00:24.78]So you swallow your pride
[00:26.33]When you're fillin' with gas
[00:27.67]And you're laughing inside
[00:29.09]about kicking your ass
[00:30.51]And you gotta stand up,
[00:31.93]If you don't then you're just falling down
[01:16.14][00:35.12]So why don't you
[02:09.33][01:18.40][00:37.02]Turn your car around
[02:12.02][01:20.98][00:39.88]Forget your way back home
[02:14.80][01:23.77][00:42.40]Cos it's not me there anymore
[02:20.12][01:29.39][00:47.71]Turn your car around
[02:23.23][01:32.07][00:50.82]You're better off alone
[02:25.72][01:34.65][00:53.27]I'll get myself up off the floor
[01:38.77][00:57.35]
[01:03.60]So I tell you it's black,
[01:04.87]but you know that is white
[01:06.20]See everything's cool
[01:07.64]When you don't have to fight
[01:09.14]There's nothing outside
[01:10.34]In the darkness waiting for you
[01:14.40]And I wish it was true
[01:59.56]We've all heard Tammy sing
[02:01.61]The girls stand by your man
[02:07.79]Like I know you can
[02:30.01](oh yeah yeah)
[02:31.54]Turn your car around
[02:37.01]Turn your car around (ohhhhh)
[02:39.96]Cos it's not me there anymore
[02:42.74]Turn your car around
[02:45.38]And make your way back home
[02:59.10][02:53.56][02:48.18]Turn your car around
[03:02.11][02:55.71][02:50.85]
