[00:13.57]In the early morning rain
[00:18.15]With a dollar in my hand
[00:22.93]And an aching in my heart
[00:27.73]And my pockets full of sand
[00:32.57]I'm a long ways from home
[00:36.94]And I missed my loved one so
[00:42.17]In the early morning rain
[00:47.45]With no place to go
[00:52.11]Out on runway number nine
[00:56.21]Big 707 set to go
[01:01.43]Well I'm out here on the grass
[01:06.19]Where the pavement never grows
[01:11.39]Where the liquor tasted good
[01:15.55]And the women all were fast
[01:20.63]There she goes my friend
[01:25.46]She's rolling out at last
[01:30.25]Hear the mighty engines roar
[01:34.90]See the silver wing on high
[01:39.68]She's away and westward bound
[01:44.38]For above the clouds she flies
[01:49.41]Where the morning rain don't fall
[01:54.14]And the sun always shines
[01:58.96]She'll be flying over my home
[02:03.76]In about three hours time
[02:08.69]This ol' airport's got me down
[02:13.28]It's no earthly good to me
[02:18.40]'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
[02:22.64]Cold and drunk as I might be
[02:27.79]Can't jump a jet plane
[02:32.53]Like you can a freight train
[02:37.38]So I best be on my way
[02:42.22]In the early morning rain
[02:46.91]So I best be on my way
[02:51.78]In the early morning rain
