[00:04.10]Now I've heard there was a secret chord
[00:07.96]That David played, and it pleased the Lord
[00:12.75]But you don't really care for music, do you?
[00:20.15]It goes like this
[00:23.72]The fourth, the fifth
[00:26.08]The minor fall, the major lift
[00:29.92]The baffled king composing Hallelujah
[00:37.80]Hallelujah
[00:41.99]Hallelujah
[00:46.11]Hallelujah
[00:50.13]Hallelujah
[00:58.14]
[00:59.67]Your faith was strong but you needed proof
[01:03.81]You saw her bathing on the roof
[01:07.92]Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
[01:16.40]She tied you
[01:18.25]To a kitchen chair
[01:20.98]She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
[01:25.07]And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
[01:31.47]
[01:32.78]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[01:41.08]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[01:53.92]
[01:54.79]You say I took the name in vain
[01:59.06]I don't even know the name
[02:02.99]But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
[02:10.97]There's a blaze of light
[02:13.71]In every word
[02:16.05]It doesn't matter which you heard
[02:19.91]The holy or the broken Hallelujah
[02:26.69]
[02:26.77]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[02:35.97]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[02:47.32]
[02:49.13]I did my best, it wasn't much
[02:53.14]I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
[02:57.63]I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
[03:05.63]And even though
[03:07.97]It all went wrong
[03:10.04]I'll stand before the Lord of Song
[03:14.14]With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
[03:21.31]
[03:22.03]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:30.57]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:38.81]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:46.72]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:55.17]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:03.92]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:12.31]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:16.64]Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:20.93]Hallelujah
