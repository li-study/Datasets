[00:26.49]I'm standing here looking in the mirror
[00:29.82]Saying "damn" to myself
[00:33.11]I should have known the day would come
[00:36.09]That she would find somebody else
[00:39.22]And all the things I took her through
[00:42.34]Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
[00:45.19]Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone
[00:47.39]
[00:50.85]1 - Cuz when a woman's fed up
[00:52.90](No matter how you beg, no)
[00:57.09]It ain't nothing you can do about it
[00:59.80](Nothing you can do about it)
[01:00.80]It's like running out of love
[01:06.43](No matter what you say, no)
[01:09.27]And then it's too late to talk about it
[01:11.65](Too late to talk about it)
[01:12.61]
[01:13.51]Now let's talk about how it all goes down
[01:16.18]I used to make love to you daily
[01:19.66]When the night fell the same
[01:22.99]And anytime that you were hurt
[01:25.79]I could feel your pain
[01:29.17]And if I had a dollar
[01:32.04]It was yours, yeah
[01:35.28]And whenever we would go out
[01:38.27]I would front the bill
[01:41.53]But now the up is down
[01:44.11]And the silence is sound
[01:47.64]I hurt you too too many times
[01:50.76]Now I can't come around
[01:51.60]
[01:54.57]1 - Cuz when a woman's fed up
[01:55.82](No matter how you beg, no)
[01:58.55]It ain't nothing you can do about it
[02:02.98](Nothing you can do about it)
[02:04.56]It's like running out of love
[02:08.37](No matter what you say, no)
[02:11.01]And then it's too late to talk about it
[02:13.84](Too late to talk about it)
[02:14.60]
[02:17.71]La da da da da la la da da
[02:21.46]La da da da da la la da da
[02:43.79]If you don't want to find out the hard way
[02:49.94]Then listen to this song while the record plays
[02:58.59]1 - Cuz when a woman's fed up
[02:59.43](No matter how you beg, no)
[03:01.80]It ain't nothing you can do about it
[03:03.73](Nothing you can do about it)
[03:07.73]It's like running out of love
[03:11.18](No matter what you say, no)
[03:13.83]And then it's too late to talk about it
[03:15.81](Too late to talk about it)
[03:16.96]
[03:21.27]You can cry a river
[03:23.74]'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
[03:27.94]But she will always remember
[03:30.65]Cuz she's a woman scorned
[03:35.08]And if you ever get her back
[03:37.47]It will never be the same
[03:40.42]She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
[03:43.25]Every time she see your face
[03:46.69]Now your trust is out the door
[03:49.51]She don't want you no more
[03:57.51]You used to tell your boys, not me
[03:58.56]And she would always be there for you
[03:59.63]If you had took the time to see
[04:01.91]What that woman meant to you
[04:05.92]Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
[04:10.20]She was raised in Illinois
[04:14.70]Right outside of Chicago
[04:17.80]Some of the best cookin' you ever had
[04:20.75]Yes, it was and I miss her
[04:25.71]Hey woman, if you're listening
[04:28.21]I said I miss you baby
