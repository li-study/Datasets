[00:07.90]
[00:11.96]I didn't know what to say
[00:15.68]I tried to look the other way
[00:18.32]When I saw you there with him
[00:22.31]Acting like I don't care
[00:24.51]But you can read from how I stare
[00:27.92]That I'm hurting deep inside
[00:31.53]But even though you look so good tonight
[00:36.41]I'll be fine
[00:39.37]But I know that for you
[00:41.59]To be here without me by your side
[00:46.91]It's a love crime
[00:48.96]Why you act so surprised
[00:51.24]I can tell from the guilt in your eyes
[00:56.35]It's a love crime to me
[01:03.65]Love has never been good to me
[01:06.78]Maybe it's just my destiny
[01:10.40]To live my life alone
[01:14.08]Who was I trying to fool
[01:16.43]Thinking our love would break the rule
[01:19.51]Still I'm standing on my own
[01:23.74]And even though you look so good tonight
[01:28.76]I'll be fine
[01:31.24]But I know that for you
[01:33.37]To be here without me by your side
[01:38.30]It's a love crime
[01:40.53]Why you act so surprised
[01:42.75]I can tell from the guilt in your eyes
[01:47.70]It's a love crime to me
[02:02.03]Here I am not knowing
[02:05.28]Tell me what to do
[02:50.50][02:31.66][02:09.44]But I know that for you
[02:52.12][02:32.86][02:11.38]To be here without me by your side
[02:57.88][02:38.39][02:16.42]It's a love crime
[02:59.82][02:40.34][02:18.47]Why you act so surprised
[03:02.14][02:42.67][02:20.81]I can tell from the guilt in your eyes
[03:04.74][02:47.66][02:25.99]It's a love crime to me
