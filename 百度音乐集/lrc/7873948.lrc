[00:02.00]Kerrie Roberts - Outcast
[00:04.00]
[00:10.73]Since I can remember
[00:12.59]Guess I been a problem
[00:14.20]Never had a filter
[00:16.09]Never been the popular one
[00:18.80]To sugar coat what I know is undeniable
[00:21.84]I just can't hide it
[00:23.62]I wear it like a letter
[00:25.44]Everywhere I go
[00:27.25]Everyone is talking
[00:29.25]I can feel them staring
[00:30.81]They hope I'm just pretending
[00:33.05]And giving up my power
[00:34.74]Caving under pressure
[00:36.60]I'm not living for them
[00:38.28]I live for something better
[02:31.57][02:16.99][01:17.56][00:40.79]I'm not good enough
[02:33.41][02:18.77][01:19.47][00:42.50]I'm not what they want
[02:35.11][02:20.55][01:21.48][00:44.49]Let me tell you what
[02:37.02][02:22.27][01:23.18][00:46.41]I know who I am
[02:38.81][02:24.00][01:25.13][00:48.13]So just throw me out
[02:40.77][02:25.99][01:26.84][00:50.02]I'm not fitting in
[02:42.62][02:28.13][01:28.80][00:51.87]I will stand my ground
[02:44.62][02:30.83][01:30.73][00:53.82]And be an outcast
[02:05.76][02:01.75][01:43.61][01:36.31][01:32.60][00:59.41][00:55.63]So-o what if I'm an outcast
[01:02.38]So what if I don't look the
[01:04.21]Part I'm supposed to play
[01:05.92]What if I don't follow
[01:07.89]All the rules they make
[01:09.69]They think I should be perfect
[01:11.53]They love it when I mess up
[01:13.26]No grace in case I blow it
[01:15.16]A good girl shouldn't need it
[02:09.51][01:39.99]So slow and everybody's so fast
[01:54.79][01:47.20]I try to play nice
[01:55.74][01:48.29]I don't want to fight
[01:56.59][01:49.25]But I won't be great
[01:57.51][01:50.16]When it sounds like I'm right
[01:58.52][01:51.26]Cause what I believe
[01:59.41][01:52.10]Is what makes me strong
[02:00.39][01:53.12]If I don't belong
[02:01.41][01:54.01]I hold onto love
[02:13.14]No matter what it costs
[02:15.11]I'll be an outcast
