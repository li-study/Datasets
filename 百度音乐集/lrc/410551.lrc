[00:00.00]I Remember
[00:00.68]I remember it well
[00:03.74]The first time that I saw
[00:07.81]Your head around the door
[00:12.03]'Cause mine stopped working
[00:17.28]I remember it well
[00:19.42]There was wet in your hair
[00:23.23]I was stood in stare
[00:27.19]And time stopped moving
[00:31.66]I want you here tonight
[00:33.73]I want you here
[00:35.95]'Cause I can't believe what I found
[00:38.90]I want you here tonight want you here
[00:44.91]Nothing is taking me down, down, down...
[00:59.84]I remember it well
[01:01.87]Taxied out of a storm
[01:05.83]To watch you perform
[01:09.23]And my ships were sailing
[01:14.96]I remember it well
[01:16.85]I was stood in your line
[01:20.92]And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth...
[01:33.29]I want you here tonight
[01:35.44]I want you here
[01:37.44]'Cause I can't believe what I found
[01:40.62]I want you here tonight want you here
[01:46.23]Nothing is taking me down, down, down...
[01:59.34]Except you my love. Except you my love...
[02:37.90]Come all ye lost
[02:40.23]Dive into moss
[02:43.00]And hope that my sanity covers the cost
[02:46.59]To remove the stain of my love
[02:50.29]In paper mache
[02:56.75]Come all ye reborn
[02:59.12]Blow off my horn
[03:00.97]I'm driving real hard
[03:02.78]This is love, this is porn
[03:05.22]God will forgive me
[03:07.50]But I, I whip myself in scorn, scorn
[03:14.31]I wanna hear what you have to say about me
[03:19.85]Hear if you're gonna live without me
[03:24.26]I wanna hear what you want
[03:27.90]I remember December
[03:32.37]And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
[03:37.77]Hear if you're gonna live without me
[03:41.95]I wanna hear what you want
