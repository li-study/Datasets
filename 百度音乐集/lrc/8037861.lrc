[00:16.91]I watch the western sky
[00:35.26]The sun is sinking
[00:39.48]The geese are flying south
[00:43.17]It sets me thinking
[00:46.40]I did not miss you much
[00:50.48]I did not suffer
[00:55.28]What did not kill me
[00:58.85]Just made me tougher
[01:03.19]I feel the winter come
[01:07.25]His icy sinews,
[01:11.38]Now in the firelight
[01:15.15]The case continues
[01:18.75]Another night in court
[01:23.14]The same old trial
[01:27.27]The same old questions asked
[01:31.04]The same denial
[01:35.49]The shadows closing round
[01:39.03]Like jury members
[01:43.07]I look for answers in
[01:46.65]The fireæŠ¯ embers
[01:51.39]Why was I missing then
[01:55.90]That whole December?
[01:59.30]I give my usual line,
[02:04.07]I don't remember
[02:07.40]Another winter comes
[02:11.55]His icy fingers creep
[02:15.48]Into these bones of mine
[02:19.24]These memories never sleep
[02:23.69]And all these differences
[02:27.39]A cloak I borrow
[02:31.68]We kept our distances
[02:35.04]Why should it follow that
[02:38.69]I must have loved you?
[02:42.26]What is a force that binds the stars?
[03:01.27]I wore this mask to hide my scars
[03:05.47]What is the power that moves the tide?
[03:08.50]Never could find a place to hide
[03:12.59]What moves the earth around the sun?
[03:16.58]What could I do but run and run and run?
[03:20.74]Afraid to love, afraid to fail
[03:24.57]A mast without a sail
[03:28.65]The moon's a fingernail
[03:33.09]And slowly sinking
[03:38.34]Another day begins
[03:42.56]And now I'm thinking
[03:45.07]That this is indifference
[03:49.27]Was my invention
[03:53.04]When everything I did
[03:56.88]Sought your attention
[04:00.20]You were my compass star
[04:04.82]You were my measure
[04:08.35]You were a pirate's map
[04:12.71]Of buried treasure
[04:17.25]If this was all correct
[04:22.19]The last thing I'd expect
[04:25.85]The prosecution rests
[04:28.69]It's time that I confessed
[04:32.87]I must have loved you
[04:36.93]I must have loved you
