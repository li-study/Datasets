[00:-2.00]The Verve - Love Is Noise
[00:-1.00]

[00:14.00]
[00:14.71]Will those feet in modern times
[00:22.17]Walk on soles that are made in China?
[00:30.07]Feel the bright prosaic malls
[00:38.02]And the corridors that go on and on and on
[00:43.53]
[00:46.03]I was blind - couldn't see
[00:49.95]We are one incomplete
[00:53.82]I was blind - in the city
[00:57.37]Waiting for light wind to be saved
[01:00.77]Cause love is noise and love is pain
[01:05.09]Love is these blues that I'm singing again
[01:09.12]Love is noise and love is pain
[01:12.93]Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again
[01:17.64]
[01:24.75]Will those feet in modern times
[01:32.66]Understand this world's affliction
[01:40.31]Recognise the righteous anger
[01:48.86]Understand this world's addiction?
[01:53.67]
[01:56.95]I was blind - couldn't see
[02:00.40]What was here in me
[02:04.66]I was blind - insecure
[02:08.34]I felt like the road was way too long, yeah
[02:12.04]Cause love is noise and love is pain
[02:16.01]Love is these blues that I'm singing again
[02:19.86]Love is noise and love is pain
[02:23.70]Love is these blues that I'm singing again
[02:27.50]Love is noise, love is pain
[02:31.40]Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
[02:35.37]Love is noise, love is pain
[02:39.28]Love is these blues that I'm singing again,
[02:43.16]again, again, again, again, again
[02:47.89]
[03:14.43]Cause love is noise, love is pain
[03:18.30]Love is these blues that you're feeling again
[03:22.13]Love is noise, love is pain
[03:26.08]Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again
[03:31.89]
[03:32.29]Will those feet in modern times
[03:35.43]Walk on soles made in China?
[03:38.42]Will those feet in modern times
[03:42.71]See the bright prosaic malls?
[03:46.12]Will those feet in modern times
[03:50.72]Recognise the heavy burden
[03:54.08]
