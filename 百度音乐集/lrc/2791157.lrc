[00:07.04]First kiss, first touch
[00:08.38]First time you ever said it back
[00:13.33]When I close my eyes I still remember
[00:19.66]Too much, too fast
[00:21.17]Too good to ever make it last
[00:26.39]And when I woke up you were gone
[00:31.67]
[00:32.13]Now I keep dreaming of falling back to sleep
[00:38.44]Cause I know you will be waiting there for me
[00:44.37]And every breath keeps me praying for the night
[00:50.56]Cause I know your on the other side
[00:56.04]But I'm wide awake
[00:59.63]I'm wide awake since you went away
[01:06.48]I'm wide awake
[01:09.01]
[01:10.82]Last hope, last chance
[01:12.29]Last time ever I felt alive
[01:17.21]Was before the morning pulled you under
[01:23.56]Tonight to close to lose the only thing
[01:27.83]That I ever believed could save me now
[01:34.63]
[01:36.15]Now I keep dreaming of falling back to sleep
[01:41.90]Cause I know you will be waiting there for me
[01:48.43]And every breath keeps me praying for the night
[01:54.26]Cause I know your on the other side
[01:59.70]But I'm wide awake
[02:07.41]But I'm wide awake
[02:11.41]
[02:14.98]I'm wide awake
[02:16.95]I'm wide awake
[02:20.12]I can't escape
[02:22.82]I'm wide awake
[02:25.40]
[02:25.86]Now I keep dreaming of falling back to sleep
[02:32.15]Cause I know you will be waiting there for me
[02:38.49]And every breath keeps me praying for the night
[02:44.83]Cause I know your on the other side
[02:49.91]But I'm wide awake
[02:53.73]I'm wide awake since you went away
[03:00.01]I'm wide awake
[03:02.87]
[03:03.41]But I'm wide awake
[03:06.52]I'm wide awake since you went away
[03:11.74]I'm wide awake
[03:15.29]
[03:16.47]I'm wide awake
