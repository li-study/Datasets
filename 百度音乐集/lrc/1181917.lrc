[00:15.58]
[00:16.41]I can't imagine how hard it must be,
[00:20.41]to be you
[00:22.95]Adopting all your history,
[00:25.76]it's hard being me too
[00:30.12]Are your secrets where you left them
[00:33.31]Cause now your ghosts are mine as well
[00:38.10]I think it's time I met them
[00:41.00]and I think it's time you tell
[00:44.67]
[00:45.78]And you should have told me when you met me
[00:50.64]All these things I should know
[00:53.46]I should have asked,
[00:56.26]we should have talked
[00:57.95]About this so long ago
[01:00.89]
[01:01.41]It's not fair,
[01:02.16]it's not fair
[01:04.55]And don't leave me here
[01:07.79]How's this happening to me
[01:10.74]It feels so lonely here
[01:15.64]
[01:16.29]We are in a mess,
[01:17.70]a danger zone
[01:19.83]What will happen next,
[01:21.59]you never know
[01:23.70]We are in a mess,
[01:25.41]a danger zone
[01:27.41]What will happen next,
[01:29.20]you never know
[01:30.86]
[01:31.41]Now we share the closet,
[01:33.54]now you've let me come inside
[01:38.38]And now you're finally undressing,
[01:41.60]and I feel like I might die
[01:46.40]The damage is infectious,
[01:49.36]the confession is too late
[01:54.00]And how can I accept this
[01:56.93]How is this happening to me
[02:00.71]
[02:01.22]It's not fair,
[02:03.09]it's not fair
[02:04.93]And I come up for air
[02:08.82]How's this happening to me
[02:11.98]It feels so lonely here
[02:16.45]
[02:17.07]We are in a mess,
[02:18.72]a danger zone
[02:20.77]What will happen next,

[02:34.13]You never know
[02:37.70]You never know
[02:47.76]
[02:57.88]All of your secrets
[02:59.89]All your lies,
[03:03.03]all of it
[03:04.18]
[03:21.16][03:04.87]We are in a mess,
[03:21.73][03:06.36]a danger zone
