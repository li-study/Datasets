[00:01.12]Bloc Party - Signs
[00:08.10]
[00:56.83]Two ravens in the old oak tree and
[01:01.44]One for you and one for me and
[01:05.46]Bluebells in the late December
[01:09.06]I see signs now all the time
[01:13.15]
[01:13.49]The last time we slept together
[01:17.57]There was something that was not there
[01:21.56]You never wanted to alarm me
[01:25.56]But I’m the one that’s drowning now
[01:29.57]
[01:45.94]I could sleep forever these days
[01:50.06]Because in my dreams I see you again
[01:54.07]But this time fleshed out fuller faced
[01:57.85]In your confirmation dress
[02:01.91]
[02:02.24]It was so like you to visit me
[02:06.37]To let me know you were ok
[02:10.05]It was so like you to visit me
[02:14.50]You always worried about someone else
[02:19.01]
[02:35.07]At your funeral I was so upset
[02:43.47]So upset so upset
[02:47.39]In your life you were larger than this
[02:55.18]Statue-statuesque
[03:01.99]
[03:48.28]I see signs now all the time
[03:52.03]That you’re not dead, you're sleeping
[03:56.21]I believe in anything
[04:00.17]That brings you back home to me
[04:04.29]
[04:04.54]I see signs now all the time
[04:08.30]That you’re not dead, you're sleeping
[04:12.55]I believe in anything
[04:16.43]That brings you back home to me.
