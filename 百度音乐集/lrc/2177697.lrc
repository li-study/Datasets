[00:27.56]Heaven only knows
[00:28.49]Heaven only knows
[00:29.73]Heaven only knows
[00:30.89]Heaven only knows
[00:31.35]
[00:33.25]Last night was the worst night
[00:36.10]Beginning of the end
[00:37.95]Or maybe it began
[00:40.38]Before it here we go again
[00:43.18]Things got so dramatic
[00:45.46]Things got out of hand
[00:48.03]We said words we couldn't imagine
[00:52.30]I don't understand
[00:53.13]
[00:54.22]There you go with the same old thing
[00:58.49]When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
[01:04.03]Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
[01:08.25]Where the end will go
[01:10.27]Will I ever know
[01:12.30]
[01:12.86]Heaven only knows
[01:13.18]Heaven only knows
[01:17.82]Heaven only knows
[01:20.50]Heaven only knows
[01:24.82]
[01:33.78]So let's make this night the best night
[01:35.83]It's time for second chance
[01:38.35]Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
[01:42.68]
[01:43.50]Sometimes when we talking words
[01:45.98]Drowned on by the sound
[01:48.41]Let's get back to touch and we'll get back on solid ground
[01:51.22]
[01:53.56]Let's hold hands
[01:56.01]Like a young romance
[01:58.28]Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
[02:03.53]Can we make love
[02:05.85]Like back way in the day
[02:08.51]We can lose control, baby don't say no
[02:11.06]
[02:12.66]Heaven only knows
[02:15.57]Heaven only knows
[02:17.55]Heaven only knows
[02:19.35]Heaven only knows
[02:19.39]
[02:35.90]So will you come back to me
[02:37.09]Heaven only knows
[02:40.28]So will you come back to me
[02:42.20]
[02:54.60]Make this night the best night
[02:56.53]It's time for second chance
[02:58.99]Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
[03:01.69]
[03:04.07]Heaven only knows
[03:06.57]Heaven only knows
[03:09.16]Heaven only knows
[03:12.52]
