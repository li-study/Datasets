[00:10.00]Freddy:
[00:13.00]When she mentioned how her aunt bit off the spoon,
[00:17.74]She completely done me in.
[00:21.66]And my heart went on a journey to the moon,
[00:25.58]When she told about her father and the gin.
[00:30.98]And I never saw a more enchanting farce
[00:35.55]Than that moment when she shouted
[00:38.56]\"move your bloomin\' \"
[00:41.07](Conversation)...
[01:10.63]I have often walked down this street before;
[01:16.28]But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before.
[01:22.02]All at once am I Several stories high.
[01:27.75]Knowing I\'m on the street where you live.
[01:33.59]Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
[01:39.30]Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
[01:44.95]Does enchantment pour Out of ev\'ry door?
[01:50.79]No, it\'s just on the street where you live!
[01:56.99]And oh! The towering feeling
[02:02.43]Just to know somehow you are near.
[02:08.34]The overpowering feeling
[02:13.74]That any second you may suddenly appear!
[02:19.70]People stop and stare. They don\'t bother me.
[02:25.52]For there\'s no where else on earth that I would rather be.
[02:31.51]Let the time go by, I won\'t care if I
[02:39.36]Can be here on the street where you live.
[02:46.12]
[02:49.55]People stop and stare. They don\'t bother me.
[02:55.06]For there\'s no where else on earth that I would rather be.
[03:01.11]Let the time go by, I won\'t care if I
[03:09.88]Can be here on the street where you live.
