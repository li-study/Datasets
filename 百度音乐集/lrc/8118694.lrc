[00:27.24]Mirror mirror
[00:28.73]How far will I go?
[00:32.05]Despite the foundation, I am falling
[00:37.23]Sweet reflection
[00:40.75]Will you save a place for me?
[00:45.77]Where am I heading?
[00:49.26]Could you grant me a haven?
[00:52.81]For what?
[00:53.67]I am punished, could I ever repent?
[01:05.02]Mother Nature, I'm wide open
[01:09.86]Waiting for you to move me
[01:14.29]Don't keep it from me
[01:19.11]This is a free fall
[01:34.16]I never seem to understand
[01:38.04]The time, the place and who I am
[01:42.36]Define a way to stay alive
[01:46.42]It's like I'm living a lie
[01:50.00]Father time, every time I stop and feel
[01:54.30]You're there to tell me I'm already late
[01:58.53]Don't keep it from me
[02:03.63]This is a free fall
[02:08.52]I never seem to understand
[02:12.60]The time, the place and who I am
[02:16.85]It's like I'm living a lie
[02:50.07]I never seem to understand
[02:54.13]The time, the place and who I am
[02:58.33]Define a way to stay alive
[03:02.47]It's like I'm living a lie
