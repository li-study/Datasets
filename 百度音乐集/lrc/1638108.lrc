[00:07.80]Narrow daylight
[00:10.59]
[00:12.67]Entered my room
[00:16.94]Shining hours were brief
[00:22.26]Winter is over
[00:24.96]Summer is near
[00:26.72]Are we stronger than we believe?
[00:33.39]
[00:37.12]I walked through halls of reputation
[00:42.36]Among the infamous too
[00:47.43]As the camera clings to the common thread
[00:53.08]Beyond all vanity
[00:55.87]Into a gaze to shoot you through
[01:00.07]
[01:02.75]Is the kindness we count upon
[01:05.97]
[01:08.88]Hidden in everyone?
[01:12.42]
[01:15.20]I stepped out in a sunlit grove
[01:19.39]Although deep down I wished it would rain
[01:26.26]Washing away all the sadness and tears
[01:31.30]That will never fall so heavily again
[01:38.52]
[02:08.44]Is the kindness we count upon
[02:14.08]Is hidden in everyone
[02:18.86]
[02:20.77]I stood there in the salt spray air
[02:25.86]Felt wind sweeping over my face
[02:31.66]I ran up through the rocks to the old wooden cross
[02:37.94]It's a place where I can find some peace
[02:41.95]
[02:45.33]Narrow daylight
[02:52.27]Entered my room
[02:56.72]Shining hours were brief
[03:02.04]Winter is over
[03:04.75]Summer is near
[03:06.47]Are we stronger than we believe?
[03:13.85]
[03:15.17]thanks
