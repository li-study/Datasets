[00:10.68]You say my love for you's not real
[00:20.06]But you don't know how real it feels

[02:06.26]Smile now, don't be afraid
[02:14.60]All I want to do is to spend some time with you
[02:21.81]So I can hold you, hold you
[02:28.95]
[02:33.15]So let me whisper in your ear
[02:42.66]Don't you worry they can't hear
[02:51.53]All I want to do is to spend some time with you
