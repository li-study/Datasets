[00:02.00]Sweetbox - Liberty
[00:03.00]
[00:06.20]Liberty...
[00:09.00]Gravity...
[00:12.08]Eternity...
[00:15.07]Memories...
[00:17.96]Freedom...Free
[00:29.80]
[00:39.55]One life wasted
[00:42.57]No one can replace it,
[00:45.20]Candles burning
[00:47.49]But the world's still turning.
[00:50.25]Did you want this?
[00:52.55]Did you think it over?
[00:55.01]Your mother sits there crying
[00:57.30]What do I say to her
[00:59.70]
[01:00.30]Is there liberty?
[01:01.39]Gravity?
[01:02.49]Do memories remain?
[01:04.62]Did you find freedom
[01:06.53]or did you break free?
[01:09.72]Liberty?
[01:11.04]Gravity?
[01:12.29]Do memories remain?
[01:14.42]Did you find freedom?
[01:16.86]or did you break free?
[01:20.47]
[01:28.68]I never knew why you gave up early
[01:31.62]I think of the times you were depressed and if didn’t concern me
[01:33.71]Days we had good and the bad
[01:36.22]But all that’s gone now
[01:37.22]And who wouldn’t be sad?
[01:39.02]Who could have saved you from cutting your life short
[01:41.48]The answer is priceless
[01:42.21]But definitely something to fight for
[01:43.74]Holing on to our memory the tears unfurl
[01:46.16]To the world you were someone
[01:47.82]And to someone the world
[01:48.36]
[01:48.65]Is there liberty?
[01:50.09]Gravity?

[01:59.89]Gravity?
[02:01.08]Do memories remain?
[02:03.18]Did you find freedom?
[02:05.61]or did you break free?
[02:09.65]
[02:17.80]Is there anger, is there pain, and do the faces stay the same?
[02:20.76]Is there justice, is there blame, or do we all just end in vain?
[02:23.09]Tell me… tell me
[02:27.75]Is there mercy, is there fame, did you find a better way?
[02:31.02]Do you hear us, do you see us, do you feel us when we pray?
[02:32.92]Tell me… tell me
[02:36.88]
[02:37.58]Is there liberty?
[02:39.02]Gravity?
[02:40.22]Do memories remain?
[02:41.58]Did you find freedom
[02:44.76]or did you break free?
[02:47.48]Liberty?
[02:48.91]Gravity?
[02:50.21]Do memories remain?
[02:52.29]Did you find freedom?
[02:54.59]or did you break free?
