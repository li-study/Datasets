[00:03.43]Album: Astronaut
[00:25.06]Suddenly it all looks so familiar
[00:30.05]Gone and wrecked it like I always do
[00:34.96]Don't you know it?
[00:36.22]Life is out to kill 'ya
[00:39.81]But you still go getting on with it
[00:43.73][01:29.77]Seen better times than right now
[00:49.14][01:35.23]But I'm not running away
[00:53.37]No nothing's gonna bring me down
[00:58.80][01:44.85]It's just been one of those days
[01:04.25]I'm not the only one
[01:11.20]They can drag me to the gates of hell now
[01:15.70]There's nothing left but I'm still hanging in
[01:20.68]Not for me, ain't no final showdown
[01:25.50]I'm too shattered to do anything
[01:39.41]'Cause nothing's going to bring me down
[01:50.35][02:26.70][02:46.16]I'm not the only one feeling this way
[01:59.95][02:36.17][02:55.86]And I'm not sorry
[02:11.36]Oh~~
[02:40.75]Not running away
[03:00.40]I hear you say
[03:05.72]And I'm not sorry
