[00:14.64]It’s hard to explain
[00:21.01]Inherently it’s just always been strange
[00:27.54]Neither here or there
[00:33.93]Always somewhat out of place everywhere
[00:40.46]Ambiguous
[00:46.69]Without a sense of belonging to touch
[00:53.13]Somewhere halfway
[00:59.47]Feeling there’s no one completely the same
[01:08.11]Standing alone
[01:10.73]Eager to just
[01:13.76]Believe it’s good enough to be what
[01:20.14]You really are
[01:21.72]But in your heart
[01:23.26]Uncertainty forever lies
[01:29.88]And you’ll always be
[01:32.96]Somewhere on the
[01:35.84]Outside
[01:41.26]Early on, you face
[01:47.31]The realization you don’t
[01:50.61]have a space
[01:54.16]Where you fit in
[02:00.26]And recognize you
[02:03.63]Were born to exist
[02:08.43]Standing alone
[02:11.66]Eager to just
[02:14.83]Believe it’s good enough to be what
[02:21.00]You really are
[02:22.64]But in your heart
[02:24.24]Uncertainty forever lies
[02:31.07]And you’ll always be
[02:34.05]Somewhere on the
[02:36.74]Outside
[02:41.46]And it’s hard
[02:43.18]And it’s hard
[02:44.76]And it’s hard
[02:48.43]Irreversibly
[02:54.70]Falling in between
[02:58.52]And it’s hard
[02:59.81]And it’s hard
[03:00.75]To be understood
[03:07.55]As you are
[03:09.17]As you are
[03:11.38]Oh, and God knows
[03:16.26]That you’re standing on your own
[03:19.76]Blind and unguided
[03:22.79]Into a world divided
[03:25.50]You’re thrown
[03:29.05]Where you’re never quite the same
[03:32.47]Although you try-try and try
[03:39.39]To tell yourself
[03:42.05]You really are
[03:43.36]But in your heart-uncertainty forever lies
[03:54.60]And you’ll always be
[03:58.00]Somewhere on the outside
