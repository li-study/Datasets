[00:31.20]Wouldn't you like to take some time
[00:40.00]Feel yourself completely
[00:43.50]Breathing out the song
[00:46.50]That you keep inside
[00:50.00]
[00:55.50]Wouldn't you like to make them smile
[01:05.00]Show them you're a wonder
[01:07.20]Offer them the world
[01:10.50]And the world is...
[01:16.20]You...
[01:30.20]
[01:43.20]Wouldn't you like a second chance
[01:52.20]Use what you've been given
[01:55.90]Prove it to us all
[01:56.80]That there's one more dance
[02:00.00]
[02:07.00]Wouldn't you like to see a change
[02:16.50]Show us we can make one
[02:19.30]Offer us the world
[02:22.00]And the world is...
[02:28.80]You...
[02:50.00]
[03:42.80]On the left side
[03:45.40]Facing us the wrong way
[03:49.00]Spending lifetimes searching for your own disguise
[03:55.20]The feeling keeps you from believing
[04:00.80]In the one thing some of us were born to hide
[04:06.80]A greatness lives within your reaches
[04:13.80]And the hope is
[04:15.20]Maybe when you lie to sleep
[04:19.00]You'll be looking forward to the morning
[04:25.20]And the mirror
[04:27.20]Waking to the face of love
[04:29.50]
[04:35.00]虽然我们渐行渐远
[04:38.00]有些融入信仰的东西永远不会改变
[04:42.00]我爱你 每一句都是真的
