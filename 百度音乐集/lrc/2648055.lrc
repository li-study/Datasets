[00:09]twilight fades
[00:14]through blistered avalon
[00:18]the sky's cruel torch
[00:23]on arching autobahn
[00:27]into the uncertain divine
[00:36]we scream into the last divine
[00:42]you make me real
[00:50]you make me real
[00:59]strong as i feel
[01:08]you make me real
[01:18]sheila rides on crashing nightingale
[01:27]intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
[01:36]with blushing brilliance alive
[01:44]because it's time to arrive
[01:52]you make me real
[02:01]you make me real
[02:10]strong as i feel
[02:18]you make me real
[02:24]lately I just can't seem to believe
[02:31]discard my friends to change the scenery
[02:40]it meant the wrold to hold a bruising faith
[02:49]but now it's just a matter of grace
[02:59]a summer storm graces all of me
[03:07]highway warm sing silent poetry
[03:14]I could bring you the light
[03:25]and take you home into the night
[03:30]you make me real
[03:30]lately I just can't seem to believe
[03:39]discard my friends to change the scenery
[03:48]it meant the wrold to hold a bruising faith
[03:56]but now it's just a matter of grace
