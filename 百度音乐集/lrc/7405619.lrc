[00:24.90]It's four in the morning, the end of December
[00:32.52]I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
[00:37.45]New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
[00:43.76]There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.
[00:50.93]I hear that you're building
[00:54.27]your little house deep in the desert
[01:02.54]You're living for nothing now
[01:06.58]I hope you're keeping some kind of record.
[01:12.34]Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
[01:22.13]She said that you gave it to her
[01:27.83]That night that you planned to go clear
[01:38.61]Did you ever go clear?
[01:43.42]Ah, the last time we saw you
[01:46.91]you looked so much older
[01:49.87]Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
[01:55.92]You'd been to the station to meet every train
[02:02.55]And you came home without Lili Marlene
[02:08.01]And you treated my woman
[02:13.65]to a flake of your life
[02:20.82]And when she came back she was nobody's wife.
[02:31.32]Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
[02:41.42]One more thin gypsy thief
[02:47.72]Well I see Jane's awake --
[02:56.53]She sends her regards.
[03:13.88]And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
[03:21.46]What can I possibly say?
[03:25.90]I guess that I miss you,
[03:28.96]I guess I forgive you
[03:32.80]I'm glad you stood in my way.
[03:38.71]If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
[03:49.71]Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.
[03:59.23]Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
[04:10.29]I thought it was there for good so I never tried.
[04:22.88]And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
[04:31.80]She said that you gave it to her
[04:37.72]That night that you planned to go clear
