[00:31.42]I'm so tired, of playing
[00:35.83]Playing with this bow and arrow
[00:39.30]Gonna give my heart away
[00:41.74]Leave it to the other girls to play
[00:48.43]For I've been a temptress too long
[00:54.68]Just. . Give me a reason to love you
[01:06.31]Give me a reason to be ee,
[01:13.01]a woman I just wanna be a woman
[01:26.94]From this time, unchained
[01:30.64]We're all looking at a different picture
[01:34.72]Thru this new frame of mind
[01:38.09]A thousand flowers could bloom
[01:45.48]Move over, and give us some room
[01:52.12]Give me a reason to love you
[01:59.92]Give me a reason to be a woman
[02:12.41]I just wanna be a woman
[02:55.17]So don't you stop, being a man
[03:03.05]Just take a little look from our side when you can
[03:12.75]Sow a little tenderness
[03:19.57]No matter if you cry
[03:27.13] Give me a reason to love you
[03:34.81]Give me a reason to be a woman
[03:48.40]Its all I wanna be is all woman
[04:06.58]For this is the beginning of forever and ever
[04:20.68]Its time to move over
