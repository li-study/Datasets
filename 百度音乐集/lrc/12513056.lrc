[00:18.03]I've read you well
[00:23.20]I just want to get away
[00:30.51]Cos you used my love
[00:36.83]I just need to get away
[00:44.79]
[00:45.29]My trust in you has been abused
[00:58.66]My trust in you has been overused
[01:11.59]
[01:12.25]Sick of this space
[01:17.06]Wish we could be far away
[01:24.60]Cos I wasted all my youth
[01:30.31]I've never see it again
[01:37.82]
[01:38.31]My trust in you has been abused
[01:51.08]My trust in you has been overused

[02:03.86]Why can you get everything?
[02:26.95]Can you tell me why I just want to run away?
[02:38.53]Can you tell me why I just want to get away?
