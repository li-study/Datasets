[00:04.97]FROM THE BOOK HOPE THROUGH HEARTSONGS
[00:06.97]
[00:08.97]One of my greatest fears is "It".
[00:13.52]I can't touch it, but I can feel it.
[00:17.61]It does not have a taste or smell,
[00:21.86]But I can hear it in my spirit.
[00:26.56]It is deep inside of me,
[00:30.62]It makes me fear my memory
[00:35.10]One day I'll live peacefully,
[00:38.98]Without the fear of "It"
[00:42.60]
[00:43.93]It is something I can't see
[00:47.97]It can never possess me
[00:52.49]It always tries to take control,
[00:56.67]I can defeat it if I believe it.
[01:01.44]It is deep inside of me,
[01:05.40]It makes me fear my memory
[01:09.65]One day I'll live peacefully,
[01:13.79]Without the fear of "It"
[01:17.13]
[01:18.70]It keeps running through my mind,
[01:22.55]I have to fight it time and time
[01:26.88]And time and time
[01:29.11]And time and time again...
[01:35.86]
[01:53.30]It is deep inside of me,
[01:57.47]It makes me fear my memory
[02:04.20]One day I'll live peacefully,
[02:08.07]Without the fear of "It"
[02:11.52]
[02:12.72]The more I understand about it
[02:17.05]The less my world revolves around it
[02:21.60]Then I can just live out my life
[02:25.53]Without the fear of "It"
[02:28.89]
