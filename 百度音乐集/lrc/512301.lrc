[00:00.00]Wait It Out

[00:02.00]by Hamlin
[00:02.69]Where do we go from here?
[00:05.59]How do we carry on?
[00:08.83]I can't get beyond the questions...
[00:10.99]
[00:15.32]Clambering for the scraps,
[00:18.46]in the shatter of us collapsed.
[00:20.41]Is cuts me with every "could have been"...
[00:25.00]
[00:30.38]Pain on, pain on, play repeating.
[00:35.81]With the backup makeshift life in waiting.
[00:38.00]
[00:41.10]Everybody says,
[00:47.19]that time heals everything.
[00:53.40]But what of the wretched hallow?
[00:59.69]The endless in-between?
[01:02.69]Are we just going to wait it out...?
[01:04.00]
[01:05.99]There's nothing to see here now,
[01:09.01]Turning the sign around.
[01:12.06]We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice.
[01:18.84]Stumbling clich√© case,
[01:21.87]Crumpled and puffy faced.
[01:24.98]Dead in the stare of a thousand miles.
[01:28.00]
[01:32.92]All-in-one, only one street-level miracle.
[01:38.92]I'll be an out-in-out, born-again from none more cynical.
[01:42.00]
[01:44.02]Everybody says,
[01:48.91]that time heals everything.
[01:54.29]All in the end.
[01:57.95]But what of the wretched hallow?
[02:02.83]The endless in-between?
[02:05.32]Are we just going to wait it out...?
[02:08.00]
[02:09.83]...and sit here cold?
[02:12.67]We'll be long gone by then, and lackluster.
[02:16.12]In dust we lay around old magazines.
[02:22.74]Fluorescent lighting sets the scene,
[02:25.59]For all we could and should be being,
[02:29.05]In the one life that we've got...
[02:36.11]
[02:54.73]In the one life that we've got.
[02:56.13]
[03:01.30]Everybody says,
[03:07.71]that time heals everything.
[03:14.46]But what of the wretched hallow?
[03:21.15]The endless in-between?
[03:22.81]
[03:23.78]Are we just going to wait it out?
[03:28.37]Sit here cold...
[03:30.98]...just going to sweat it out?
[03:36.16]
[03:46.24]Wait it out.
