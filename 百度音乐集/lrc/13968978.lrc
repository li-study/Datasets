[00:04.52]Corinne Bailey Rae
[00:05.36]
[00:08.29]Three little birds, sat on my window.
[00:13.29]And they told me I don't need to worry.
[00:19.01]Summer came like cinnamon
[00:21.44]So sweet,
[00:22.86]Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.
[00:28.14]Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's alright
[00:37.22]The more things seems to change, the more they seem to stay the same.
[00:45.08]Oh, don't you hesitate.
[00:48.01]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
[00:53.29]You go ahead, let your hair down
[00:58.04]Saphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
[01:02.78]Just go ahead, let your hair down.
[01:07.96]You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
[01:15.29]Blue as the sky, sombre and lonely,
[01:20.27]Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
[01:22.82](just relax, just relax)
[01:25.31]Don't you let those other boys fool you,
[01:30.19]Gotta love that afro hairdo.
[01:35.42]Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
[01:44.22]The more things stay the same, the more they seem to change.
[01:53.07]Don't you think it's strange?
[01:55.38]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
[02:00.64]You go ahead, let your hair down
[02:05.35]Saphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
[02:10.69]Just go ahead, let your hair down.
[02:15.82]You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
[02:20.85]Twas' more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
[02:25.68]Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
[02:30.79]When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer.
[02:38.04]Do what you want to.
[02:40.46]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
[02:45.83]You go ahead, let your hair down
[02:50.44]Saphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
[02:55.85]Just go ahead, let your hair down.
[03:20.69]Oh, You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
