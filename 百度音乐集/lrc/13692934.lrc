[00:19.15]Listen to the ground:
[00:21.30]There is movement all around.
[00:23.04]There is something goin’ down
[00:25.20]And I can feel it.
[00:26.80]
[00:28.00]On the waves of the air,
[00:29.69]There is dancin’ out there.
[00:31.96]If it’s somethin’ we can share,
[00:33.91]We can steal it.
[00:35.53]
[00:37.47]And that sweet city woman,
[00:39.31]She moves through the light,
[00:41.70]Controlling my mind and my soul.
[00:45.67]When you reach out for me
[00:48.26]Yeah, and the feelin’ is bright,
[00:49.22]
[00:49.81]Then I get night fever, night fever.
[00:53.13]We know how to do it.
[00:58.39]Gimme that night fever, night fever.
[01:01.75]We know how to show it.
[01:04.79]
[01:07.48]Here I am,
[01:09.51]Prayin’ for this moment to last,
[01:13.94]Livin’ on the music so fine,
[01:17.26]Borne on the wind,
[01:19.46]Makin’ it mine.
[01:20.60]
[01:24.94]Night fever, night fever.
[01:28.31]We know how to do it.
[01:33.80]Gimme that night fever, night fever.
[01:38.10]We know how to show it.
[01:40.33]
[01:42.73]In the heat of our love,
[01:44.21]Don’t need no help for us to make it.
[01:46.91]Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin’.
[01:51.21]I got fire in my mind.
[01:53.12]I got higher in my walkin’.
[01:55.60]And I’m glowin’ in the dark;
[01:57.47]I give you warnin’.
[01:59.03]
[02:00.77]And that sweet city woman,
[02:02.61]She moves through the light,
[02:05.01]Controlling my mind and my soul.
[02:09.44]When you reach out for me
[02:11.16]Yeah, and the feelin’ is bright,
[02:12.63]
[02:13.02]Then I get night fever, night fever.
[02:16.71]We know how to do it.
[02:22.01]Gimme that night fever, night fever.
[02:25.41]We know how to show it.
[02:26.32]
[02:30.84]Here I am,
[02:33.14]Prayin’ for this moment to last,
[02:37.46]Livin’ on the music so fine,
[02:40.80]Borne on the wind,
[02:43.00]Makin’ it mine.
[02:44.14]
[02:48.47]Night fever, night fever.
[02:51.87]We know how to do it.
[02:57.35]Gimme that night fever, night fever.
[03:00.98]We know how to show it.
