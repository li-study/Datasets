[00:11.73]Maybe we're all different
[00:13.84]But we're still the same
[00:17.19]We all got the blood of Eden
[00:20.08]Running to our veins
[00:22.69]I know sometimes it's hard for you to see
[00:28.31]You cought between just who you are
[00:31.06]And who you want to be
[00:33.73]If you feel alone and lost and need a friend
[00:38.66]Remember every new beginning
[00:42.03]Is some beginning's end

[01:03.95][02:10.64][03:01.84]You're exactly where you're supposed to be
[01:18.17]When everybody's in
[01:20.54]And you're left out
[01:24.03]And you feel drowning
[01:26.48]In a shadow of the dawn
[01:29.55]Everyone's a miracle
[01:31.54]In their own way
[01:34.77]Just listen to yourself
[01:37.21]Not what other people say
[01:40.38]When it seems you're lost alone and feeling down
[01:45.51]Remember everybody's different
[01:48.66]Just take a look around
[02:14.16]Be who you want to be
[02:16.80]Be who you are
[02:19.58]Everyone's a hero
[02:22.43]Everyone's a star
[02:30.73]When you want to give up
[02:32.85]And your heart's about to break
[02:36.16]Remember that you're perfect
[02:38.97]God's make no mistakes
