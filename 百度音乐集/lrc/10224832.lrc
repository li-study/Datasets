[00:24.07]Kiss me like you mean it,
[00:28.30]Treat me like I'm special,
[00:33.12]Cover me with sweetness,
[00:37.63]Cause a time will come,
[00:39.89]When I'm not so young, and beautiful,
[00:46.84]While we're young and beautiful,
[00:51.16]Living free and easy,
[00:55.92]Here without a worry,
[01:00.64]Dancing in our bare feet,
[01:05.94]Cause when the summer's done,
[01:08.73]When I won't be so young, and beautiful.
[01:13.94]It's a crazy ride,
[01:18.57]And baby, you and I,
[01:23.12]Are keeping our sweet love alive,
[01:29.73]Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.
[01:37.52]While we're young and beautiful,
[01:41.70]We'll party down on Main street,
[01:46.95]Wearing next to nothing,
[01:51.47]Feeling every heart beat,
[01:55.91]Having fun, while we're still young and beautiful.
[02:04.89]It's a crazy ride,
[02:09.63]And baby, you and I,
[02:14.19]Are keeping our sweet love alive,
[02:18.66]Tonight, while we're young and beautiful.
