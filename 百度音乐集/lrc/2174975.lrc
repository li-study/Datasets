[00:02.40]Vedera----Back to the middle
[00:03.36]
[00:04.37]It's on the road that I'm drawn back to you
[00:10.55]As he miles remenber me as I go
[00:18.66]It's in the silence of a night's dream that I recall the words at devotion we
[00:31.45]And I can't remenber where our bodies roamed
[00:35.49]I can't remenber  all alone how our love got lost out in the cold
[00:44.78]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[00:52.88]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[00:59.95]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[01:08.09]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[01:15.14]I separated all I thought I knew
[01:21.32]into pile of books collopsed upon my floor
[01:29.22]I memorized the words in code and true
[01:35.49]But I can't carry them with me no more
[01:41.75]And I can't remenber where our bodies roamed
[01:46.10]I can't remenber  all alone how our love got lost out in the cold
[01:55.42]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[02:03.31]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[02:10.29]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[02:17.32]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[02:25.45]Don't tell you've   been swept  away
[02:31.85]I can't believe it about you !
[02:35.40]I can't believe it about you !
[02:39.89]Don't tell you've   been swept  away
[02:46.28]I can't believe it about you !
[02:49.96]I can't believe it about you !
[02:53.59]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[03:01.80]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[03:08.11]But  you're the only song I hear in this great wandering mess of my years
[03:15.96]you're the only one I know  who brings back to the middle
[03:22.93]And you will draw me near when the sky open and we appear
[03:30.04]and you'll bring me once again back to the middle
