[00:13.14](Nick) Before you're pointing at me,
[00:15.31]There is a possibility,
[00:18.08]You better turn that finger around
[00:23.83]Defense comes easily
[00:26.46]So don't you tread on me
[00:29.19]Cause I will knock you down
[00:33.93]
[00:34.74]Some days it seems it's not worth it
[00:37.46]The fight in me is all gone
[00:39.95]And I'm not trying to be perfect
[00:42.63]To just get one damn thing done.
[00:45.35]Before I lose control
[00:48.17]I pick myself up off the floor.
[00:50.14]
[00:50.87]Before you're pointing at me,

[01:04.32]So don't you tread on me
[01:07.12]Cause I will knock you down
[01:11.91]
[01:12.68]Never come a day that’ll solve you
[01:15.03]Consequently I could never leave you
[01:17.70]In the shadow of those living battleships,
[01:20.72]I love our canoe
[01:23.39]I’m ready for the falls and the still waters
[01:26.85]we will find our true
[01:28.72]Oh there’s a clock in my head
[01:31.89]And despite what it said
[01:34.60]Another one in the wall
[01:37.31]We don’t agree at all
[01:39.99]And this just gives ‘em to me
[01:42.60]And despite what you see
[01:45.47]You must see me as calm, but I go off like a bomb
[01:48.07]
[01:50.47]Before you're pointing at me,
[01:52.84]There is a possibility,
[01:55.55]You better turn that finger around

[02:11.45]
[02:16.01]Woah
[02:20.27]Ohh in the comfort of strangers
[02:23.57]You don’t see the danger of just letting it flow
[02:28.99]This I know.
[02:31.82]
[02:33.80]Before you're pointing at me,
[02:36.13]There is a possibility,
