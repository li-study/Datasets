[00:00.00]John Mayer - New Deep
[00:25.08]
[00:27.08]I'm so alive
[00:30.20]I'm so enlightened
[00:32.84]I can barely survive
[00:36.60]A night in my mind
[00:39.89]I've got a plan
[00:43.24]I'm gonna find out just how boring I am
[00:49.80]And have a good time
[00:52.19]Cause ever since I tried
[00:54.24]Trying not to find
[00:55.73]Every little meaning in my life
[00:58.85]It's been fine
[01:00.52]I've been cool
[01:02.27]With my new golden rule
[01:05.36]Numb is the new deep
[01:08.84]Done with the old me
[01:12.05]And talk is the same cheap it's been
[01:17.17]
[01:32.86]Is there a God?
[01:36.01]Why is he waiting?
[01:38.78]Don't you think of it odd
[01:42.37]When he knows my address?
[01:45.82]And look at the stars
[01:49.15]Don't it remind you just how feeble we are?
[01:55.31]Well it used to, I guess
[01:58.20]Cause ever since I tried
[01:59.90]Trying not to find
[02:01.53]Every little meaning in my life
[02:04.73]It's been fine
[02:06.37]I've been cool
[02:08.09]With my new golden rule
[02:11.33]Numb is the new deep
[02:14.66]Done with the old me
[02:17.98]And talk is the same cheap it's been
[02:23.16]
[02:25.77]I'm a new man
[02:28.80]I wear a new cologne and
[02:32.04]You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
[02:38.52]I know what you'll say
[02:41.86]'This won't last longer than the rest of the day'
[02:47.94]But you're wrong this time
[02:50.90]You're wrong
[02:52.66]
[02:54.25]Numb is the new deep
[02:57.54]Done with the old me
[03:00.71]I'm over the analyzing
[03:04.13]Tonight
[03:05.95]
[03:08.72]Stop trying to figure it out
[03:11.33](you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
[03:15.12]Deep will only bring you down
[03:19.38]You know,
[03:19.78]I used to be the back porch poet with a book of rhymes
[03:24.45]Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
[03:28.87]Never gonna find the perfect rhyme
[03:32.86]For 'heavier things'
[03:36.11]
