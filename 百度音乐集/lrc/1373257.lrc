[00:16.00]You're only just a dream boat
[00:19.00]Sailing in my head
[00:23.00]You swim my secret oceans
[00:26.00]Of coral blue and red
[00:29.00]Your smell is incense burning
[00:33.00]Your touch is silken yet
[00:36.00]It reaches through my skin
[00:39.00]Moving from within
[00:43.00]And clutches at my breast
[03:08.00][01:45.00][00:45.00]But it's only when I sleep
[03:11.00][01:49.00][00:49.00]See you in my dreams
[03:15.00][01:52.00][00:53.00]Got me spinning round and round
[03:19.00][01:56.00][00:57.00]Turning upside down
[03:22.00][01:59.00][00:59.00]But I only hear you breathe
[02:02.00][01:02.00]Somewhere in my sleep
[02:06.00][01:06.00]Got me spinning round and round
[02:10.00][01:10.00]Turning upside down
[02:12.00][01:12.00]But it's only when I sleep
[01:15.00]And when I wake from slumber
[01:19.00]Your shadow's disappeared
[01:22.00]Your breath is just a sea mist
[01:25.00]Surrounding my body
[01:29.00]I'm working through the daytime
[01:32.00]But when it's time to rest
[01:35.00]I'm lying in my bed
[01:39.00]Listening to my breath
[01:42.00]Falling from the edge
[02:25.00]But it's only when I sleep...
[02:41.00](Up to the sky)
[02:44.00](Where angels fly)
[02:47.00](I'll never die)
[02:51.00](Hawaiian high)
[02:55.00]It's reaching through my skin
[02:58.00]Moving from within
[03:01.00]And clutches at my breast
[03:24.00](In bed I lie)
[03:27.00](No need to cry)
[03:31.00](My sleeping cry)
[03:34.00](Hawaiian high)
