[00:13]I kept the right ones out
[00:17]And let the wrong ones in
[00:20]Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
[00:27]There were times in my life
[00:30]When I was goin' insane
[00:34]Tryin' to walk through
[00:37]The pain
[00:41]When I lost my grip
[00:45]And I hit the floor
[00:48]Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
[00:55]I was so sick and tired
[00:58]Of a livin' a lie
[01:02]I was wishin' that I
[01:05]Would die
[01:09][02:49]It's Amazing
[01:12][02:52]With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
[01:22][03:03]It's Amazing
[01:26][03:06]When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
[01:37][03:17]It's Amazing
[01:40][03:20]And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
[01:50]That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
[01:57]And how high can you fly with broken wings?
[02:04]Life's a journey not a destination
[02:11]And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
[02:21]You have to learn to crawl
[02:25]Before you learn to walk
[02:28]But I just couldn't liten to all that righteous talk
[02:35]I was out on the street,
[02:38]Just a tryin' to survive
