[00:00.74]New Moon On Monday
[00:05.21]Duran Duran
[00:11.32]Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
[00:14.76]With your dance on the eventide
[00:19.09]You got me coming up with answers
[00:22.95]All of which I deny
[00:26.89]I said it again
[00:28.33]Could I please rephrase it
[00:30.76]Maybe I can catch a ride
[00:34.66]I couldn't really put it much plainer
[00:38.32]But I'll wait till you decide
[00:42.73]Send me your warning siren
[00:46.10]As if I could ever hide
[00:50.61]Last time La Luna
[00:54.32]I light my torch and wave it for the
[00:58.37]New moon on Monday
[01:01.69]And a firedance through the night
[01:06.34]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[01:14.33]New moon on Monday
[01:17.49]And a firedance through the night
[01:22.19]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[01:32.52]~~~~~~
[01:38.20]Breaking away with the best of both worlds
[01:41.48]A smile that you can't disguise
[01:45.89]Every minute I keep finding
[01:49.79]Clues that you leave behind
[01:53.74]Save me from these reminders
[01:57.16]As if I'd forget tonight
[02:01.20]This time La Luna
[02:05.09]I light my torch and wave it for the
[02:09.44]New moon on Monday
[02:12.73]And a firedance through the night
[02:17.41]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[02:25.27]New moon on Monday
[02:28.50]And a firedance through the night
[02:32.98]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[02:41.06]~~~~~~
[03:00.87]I light my torch and wave it for the
[03:04.63]New moon on Monday
[03:07.90]And a firedance through the night
[03:12.51]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[03:20.50]New moon on Monday
[03:23.62]And a firedance through the night
[03:28.32]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[03:36.26]New moon on Monday
[03:39.40]And a firedance through the night
[03:44.16]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
[03:52.14]New moon on Monday
[03:55.29]And a firedance through the night
[03:59.90]I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
