[00:01.12]Needtobreathe - Something Beautiful
[00:04.11]
[00:08.67]In your ocean, I'm ankle deep
[00:12.72]I feel the waves crashin' on my feet
[00:17.12]It's like I know where I need to be
[00:21.46]But I can't figure out, yeah I can't figure out
[00:26.28]
[00:26.60]Just how much air I will need to breathe
[00:31.06]When your tide rushes over me
[00:35.19]There's only one way to figure out
[00:39.52]Will ya let me drown, will ya let me drown
[00:44.41]
[00:45.50]Hey now, this is my desire
[00:49.16]Consume me like a fire, 'cause I just want something beautiful
[00:55.38]To touch me, I know that I'm in reach
[00:59.13]'Cause I am down on my knees, I'm waiting for something beautiful
[01:06.75]Oh, something beautiful
[01:16.04]
[01:19.26]And the water is risin' quick
[01:23.56]And for years I was scared of it
[01:27.61]We can't be sure when it will subside
[01:31.98]So I won't leave your side, no I can't leave your side
[01:37.32]
[01:38.13]Hey now, this is my desire
[01:41.57]Consume me like a fire, 'cause I just want something beautiful
[01:47.87]To touch me, I know that I'm in reach
[01:51.57]'Cause I am down on my knees, I'm waiting for something beautiful
[01:59.22]Oh, something beautiful
[02:18.28]
[02:28.97]In a daydream, I couldn't live like this
[02:33.83]I wouldn't stop until I found something beautiful
[02:38.81]When I wake up, I know I will have
[02:43.86]No, I still won't have what I need
[02:48.32]
[02:48.61]Hey now, this is my desire
[02:51.60]Consume me like a fire, 'cause I just want something beautiful
[02:58.74]To touch me, I know that I'm in reach
[03:01.66]'Cause I am down on my knees, I'm waiting for something beautiful
[03:09.37]Oh, something beautiful (fade out)
