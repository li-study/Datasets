[00:22.16]I didn't mean it
[00:23.42]When I said I didn't love you so
[00:25.60]I should have held on tight
[00:26.87]I never should've let you go
[00:29.03]I did nothing  I was stupid
[00:31.27]I was foolish
[00:32.05]I was lying to myself
[00:35.74]I could not fathom that I would ever
[00:37.22]Be without your love
[00:39.29]Never imagined I'd be
[00:40.58]Sitting here beside myself
[00:42.80]I didn't know you  I didn't know me
[00:44.45]But I thought I knew everything
[00:45.28]I never felt
[00:48.90]The feeling that I'm feeling now
[00:49.97]Now that I don't  Hear your voice
[00:55.65][00:52.03]Or even touch or even kiss your lips
[00:57.45][00:53.39]Cause I don't have a choice
[01:02.83]When you left  I lost a part of me
[01:06.96]It's still so hard to believe
[01:10.30]Come back baby please
[01:12.60]We belong together
[01:15.68]Who else am I gonna lean on
[01:17.39]When times get rough
[01:19.06]Who's gonna talk to me
[01:20.40]Till the sun comes up
[01:22.54]Who's gonna take your place
[01:23.99]Baby nobody else  We belong together
[01:30.28]I can't sleep at night
[01:32.02]When you're all on my mind
[01:33.65]Bobby Womack's on the radio
[01:36.02]Singing to me
[01:37.11]If you think you're lonely now
[01:39.59]Wait a minute
[01:40.65]This is too deep, too deep
[01:42.30]I gotta change the station
[01:43.68]So I turn the dial
[01:45.88]Trying to catch a break
[01:47.10]And then I hear Babyface
[01:49.78]I only think of you
[01:52.28]And it's breaking my heart
[01:54.01]I'm trying to keep it together
[01:55.69]But I'm falling apart
[01:57.60]I'm feeling all out of my element
[01:59.58]I'm throwing things
[02:00.83]Crying  Trying to figure out
[02:01.88]Where the hell I went wrong
[02:02.79]The pain reflected in this song
[02:04.81]Ain't even half of what
[02:06.18]I'm feeling inside  I need you
[02:08.31]Need you back in my life baby
[02:38.57][02:11.41]When you left  I lost a part of me
[02:43.14][02:15.73]It's still so hard to believe
[02:46.34][02:18.92]Come back baby please
[02:48.73][02:21.19]We belong together
[02:51.25][02:24.45]Who else am I gonna lean on
[02:52.76][02:26.00]When times get rough
[02:54.35][02:27.53]Who's gonna talk to me
[02:55.63][02:28.76]Till the sun comes up
[02:57.78][02:30.77]Who's gonna take your place
[02:59.34][02:32.36]There ain't nobody else
[03:02.40][02:35.27]We belong together
