[00:02.00]Simply Red - Holding Back The Years
[00:04.00]
[01:10.03][00:12.11]Holding back the years,
[00:17.53]Thinking of the fear I've had for so long.
[00:23.40]When somebody hears,
[00:28.26]Listen to the fear that's gone.
[00:36.96]Strangled by the wishes of pater,
[00:42.42]Hoping for the arm of mater,
[00:48.04]Get to me sooner or later,
[02:10.18][02:04.99][01:59.49][01:01.70][00:56.15]I'll keep holding on,
[01:15.68]Chance for me to escape from all I know.
[01:21.25]Holding back the tears.
[01:26.50]There's nothing here has grown.
[01:34.67]I've wasted all my tears,
[01:40.20]Wasted all those years.
[01:45.83]Nothing had the chance to be good,
[01:51.88]Nothing ever could, yeah.
[02:15.71]I'll keep holding on.
[02:22.53]So tight.
