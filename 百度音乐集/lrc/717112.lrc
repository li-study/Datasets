[00:00.49]王杰 - Right Here Waiting
[00:45.66]
[00:49.57]Oceans apart day after day
[00:55.85]And I slowly go insane
[01:00.58]I hear your voice on the line
[01:06.47]But it doesn't stop the pain
[01:10.96]If I see you next to never
[01:16.39]How can we say forever
[01:21.32]Wherever you go
[01:23.84]Whatever you do
[01:26.23]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:31.90]Whatever it takes
[01:34.48]Or how my heart breaks
[01:36.86]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:44.52]
[01:48.04]I took for granted, all the times
[01:54.42]That I thought would last somehow
[01:59.30]I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
[02:05.01]But I can't get near you now
[02:09.85]Oh, can't you see it baby
[02:15.10]You've got me goin, crazy
[02:20.08]Wherever you go
[02:22.60]Whatever you do
[02:25.05]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:30.58]Whatever it takes
[02:33.11]Or how my heart breaks
[02:35.53]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:44.64]I wonder how we can survive
[02:49.69]This romance
[02:52.54]
[02:52.88]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:58.04]I'll take the chance
[03:12.12]
[03:24.15]Oh, can't you see it baby
[03:29.38]You've got me goin, crazy
[03:34.27]Wherever you go
[03:36.65]Whatever you do
[03:39.04]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:44.95]Whatever it takes
[03:47.31]Or how my heart breaks
[03:49.74]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:59.30]
[04:03.90]Waiting for you
[04:05.44]
