[00:18.85]
[00:20.85]I worry
[00:22.18]I weigh three times my body
[00:25.86]I worry
[00:27.17]I throw my fear around
[00:30.93]But this morning
[00:33.16]There's a calm I can't explain
[00:36.66]The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
[00:40.73]
[00:51.16]By the time I recognize this moment
[00:56.26]This moment will be gone
[01:01.11]But I will bend the light pretending
[01:06.07]That it somehow lingered on
[01:10.13]Well all I got's
[01:11.42]
[01:24.76]And I will wait to find
[01:29.48]If this will last forever
[01:34.55]And I will wait to find
[01:39.62]If this will last forever
[01:44.62]And I will pay no mind
[01:48.86]When I won't and it won't cause it can't
[01:54.14]It just can't
[01:56.08](It's not supposed to)
[01:58.38]
[02:01.72]Was there a second of time I looked around?
[02:06.70]Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
[02:12.06]Was anything enough to kiss the ground
[02:15.95]And say I'm here now
[02:18.41]And she is here now
[02:20.77]
[02:53.67]So much wasted in the afternoon
[03:03.66]So much sacred in the month of June
[03:12.34]How about you?
[03:16.04]
[03:25.56]And I will wait to find
[03:30.51]If this will last forever
[03:35.66]And I will wait to find
[03:39.79]That it won't and it won't it won't
[03:45.67]And I will pay no mind
[03:50.52]worry about the way the weather
[03:55.98]And I will waste no time
[04:00.30]Remembering our life together
[04:03.97]
