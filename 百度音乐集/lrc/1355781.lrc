[00:38.11]I will be the answer
[00:42.68]At the end of the line
[00:47.07]I will be there for you
[00:51.61]Why take the time
[00:55.98]In the burning of uncertainty
[01:00.90]I will be your solid ground
[01:05.86]I will hold the balance
[01:09.82]If you can't look down
[01:11.34]
[01:17.68]If it takes my whole life
[01:21.82]I won't break, I won't bend
[01:26.86]It will all be worth it
[01:31.08]Worth it in the end
[01:35.30]Because I can only tell you that I know
[01:40.12]That I need you in my life
[01:45.24]When the stars have all gone out
[01:48.38]You'll still be burning so bright
[01:54.98]
[01:59.33]Cast me gently
[02:04.11]Into morning
[02:08.63]For the night has been unkind
[02:16.95]Take me to a
[02:21.34]Place so holy
[02:25.44]That I can wash this from my mind
[02:31.73]And break choosing not to fight
[02:38.54]
[02:44.59]If it takes my whole life
[02:48.83]I won't break, I won't bend
[02:53.30]It will all be worth it
[02:57.04]Worth it in the end
[03:01.76]Because I can only tell you that I know
[03:06.42]That I need you in my life
[03:11.63]When the stars have all gone out
[03:14.56]You'll still be burning so bright
[03:21.22]
[03:31.09]Cast me gently
[03:35.30]Into morning
[03:39.89]For the night has been unkind
[03:47.30]
