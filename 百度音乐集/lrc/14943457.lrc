[00:00.00]Norah Jones - Come Away With Me
[00:21.31]
[00:23.31]Come away with me in the night
[00:32.11]Come away with me
[00:34.14]And I will write you a song
[00:41.70]
[00:45.58]Come away with me on a bus
[00:54.39]Come away where they can't tempt us
[01:01.02]With their lies
[01:05.44]
[01:06.82]And I want to walk with you
[01:12.07]On a cloudy day
[01:15.63]In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
[01:20.82]So won't you try to come
[01:25.54]Come away with me and we'll kiss
[01:30.29]On a mountaintop
[01:34.39]Come away with me
[01:37.24]And I'll never stop loving you
[01:44.26]
[02:31.65]And I want to wake up with the rain
[02:36.85]Falling on a tin roof
[02:41.34]While I'm safe there in your arms
[02:45.44]So all I ask is for you
[02:50.37]To come away with me in the night
[02:55.34]
[02:59.24]Come away with me
[03:05.75]
