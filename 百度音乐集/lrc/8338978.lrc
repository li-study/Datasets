[00:04.29]Maroon 5
[00:06.42]
[00:16.38]Now as the summer fades
[00:18.45]I let you slip away
[00:21.00]You say I''m not your type
[00:23.51]But I can make you sway
[00:25.07]
[00:25.68]It makes you burn to learn
[00:28.12]You''re not the only one
[00:30.17]I left you, be a field
[00:31.97]Put down your blazing gun
[00:33.76]Now you''ve gone somewhere else
[00:35.89]Far away
[00:37.07]I don''t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
[00:43.09]But you feel my breath
[00:45.23]On your neck
[00:46.22]Can t believe I''m right behind you (right behind you)
[00:51.51]Cause you keep me coming back for more
[00:56.65]And I feel a little better than I did before
[01:00.97]If I never see your face again
[01:03.74]I don''t mind
[01:05.53]Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
[01:11.31]
[01:15.37]Sometimes you move so well
[01:17.27]It''s hard not to give in
[01:19.91]I''m lost, I can''t tell
[01:21.59]Where you end and I begin
[01:23.52]
[01:24.36]It makes me burn to learn
[01:26.34]You''re with another man
[01:29.09]I wonder if he''s half
[01:30.91]The lover that I am
[01:32.58]Now you''ve gone somewhere else
[01:35.04]Far away
[01:36.03]I don''t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
[01:42.22]But you feel my breath
[01:44.22]On your neck
[01:45.05]Can''t believe I''m right behind you (right behind you)
[01:50.43]Cause you keep me coming back for more
[01:55.53]And I feel a little better than I did before
[01:59.81]If I never see your face again
[02:02.74]I don''t mind
[02:04.37]Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
[02:10.42]
[02:11.46]Baby, baby
[02:12.64]Please believe me
[02:13.82]Find it in your heart to reach me
[02:16.10]Promise not to leave me behind
[02:18.42](Promise not to leave me behind)
[02:20.82]Take me back, but take it easy
[02:23.06]Make me think but don''t deceive me
[02:25.26]Talk to me by taking your time
[02:28.16](Talk to me, talk to me)
[02:29.18]Cause you keep me coming back for more
[02:33.67]And I feel a little better than I did before
[02:38.19]And if I never see your face again
[02:41.05]I don''t mind
[02:43.06]Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
[02:47.06](talk to me, talk to me)
[02:49.11]Keep me coming back for more
[02:51.53]And I feel a little better than I did before
[02:56.28]If I never see your face again
[02:59.13]I don''t mind
[03:00.96]Cause we got much further than I thought we get tonight
