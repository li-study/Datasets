[00:11.20]How you spend your minutes are what matters
[00:16.58]All tomorrows come from yesterdays
[00:21.52]When you're feeling broken, bruised
[00:23.58]And sometimes shattered
[00:26.29]Blow out the candles on the cake
[00:29.02]Like everything's a big mistake
[00:32.14]It seems you always wait for life to happen
[00:37.44]And your last buck can't buy a lucky break
[00:42.70]If all we've got is us
[00:44.86]Then life's worth living
[00:47.63][01:35.26]And if you're in, you know I'm in
[00:50.67][01:38.33]I'm ready and I'm willing
[00:53.16][01:03.71][01:14.29][01:40.93][01:51.39][02:02.08][02:15.36][02:17.73][02:41.98][02:52.55][03:03.20][03:13.80][03:24.39][03:29.51][03:34.79]I am
[00:56.00][01:43.66][02:44.81][03:06.10]When you think that no one needs you
[00:58.74][01:46.50][02:47.53][03:08.77]Sees you or believes you
[01:01.10][01:48.82][02:49.97][03:11.20]No one's there to understand
[01:06.44][01:54.20][02:55.28][03:16.70]I'll be there to be that someone
[01:09.41][01:57.16][02:58.22][03:19.44]When you think that no one
[01:11.93][01:59.64][03:00.70][03:22.05]Is there to hold your hand
[01:20.28]We're just who we are
[01:21.89]There's no pretending
[01:24.67]It takes a while to learn to live
[01:27.42]In your own skin
[01:30.18]Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending
[02:05.42]I ain't got no halo hanging over my head
[02:10.43]I ain't gonna judge you
[02:13.07]I'm just here to love you
[03:40.09]
