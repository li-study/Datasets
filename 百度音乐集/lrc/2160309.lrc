[01:50.21]But you ain\'t comin\' in.
[01:53.96]Shed the light on all the ones who never thought they would become
[01:58.30]A father, mother asking why this world can be so cold.
[02:04.69]Doesn\'t come down when she calls,
[02:07.97]\"It\'s time for breakfast.\"
[02:10.73]The memories begin to fall.
