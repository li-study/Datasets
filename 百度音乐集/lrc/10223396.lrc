[00:06.25]One Note Samba
[00:08.52]to-music
[00:12.18]This is just a little samba
[00:15.23]Built upon a single note
[00:18.57]Other notes are sure to follow
[00:22.05]But the root is still that note
[00:23.23]
[00:23.83]Now this new note is the consequence of
[00:25.92]the one we've just been through
[00:28.05]As i'm bound to be the unavoidable
[00:32.47]consequence of you
[00:34.76]There's so many people who can
[00:37.11]talk and talk and talk
[00:37.87]And just say nothing or nearly nothing
[00:39.25]I have used up all the scale i know
[00:41.46]and at the end i've come
[00:43.10]To nothing i mean nothing
[00:43.88]
[00:44.44]So i come back to my first note
[00:46.43]as i must come back to you
[00:48.90]I will pour into that one note
[00:51.69]all the love i feel for you
[00:54.01]Any one who wants
[00:56.67]the whole show show do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ci-do
[01:00.33]He will find himself with no show
[01:01.78]better play the note you know
[03:50.19]This is just a little samba
[03:50.62]Built upon a single note
