[00:11.86]I grew up as an orphan in a big old house
[00:14.48]I had no mother and no father, they had left me out
[00:17.03]Confused was the word for me, the confusion
[00:19.89]It planted a seed, in me
[00:22.83]
[00:24.71]And I was placed in this home as a five year old
[00:27.24]I was presented to my forster mother, she was so old
[00:29.87]She took advantage of my company
[00:32.31]It was nothing but slavery, slavery
[00:36.00]
[00:37.73]She's dead in the house
[00:43.10]She's dead in the house
[00:47.61]She's dead in the house
[00:50.01]
[00:53.70]You grow up under pressure and psychic terror
[00:56.18]Then eventually your brain will just flip out and go "error"
[00:58.79]The satisfaction of a murder for a little boy
[01:01.19]Is so unhealthy, but it helped me on my journey to joy
[01:03.89]And I prepared for a sweet revenge
[01:06.37]No regrets ever since, ever since
[01:11.27]
[01:12.43]Dead in the house
[01:17.05]Oh she's dead in the house
[01:21.71]She's dead, dead in the house
[01:26.73]Oh she's dead
[01:30.01]Spread out she's all over the place in the house
[01:32.59]And she's dead
[01:34.15]
[01:43.14]A chainsaw is nice it's a healthy tool
[01:45.67]Or perhaps a good old fashioned drowning in the garden pool
[01:48.20]Or a brick in the head for all the stuff she said
[01:50.71]A machete-massacre, I'll shred her up in my head
[01:53.45]There's a blood thirsty killer and a caterpillar
[01:56.11]It would crush her into pieces, I would gladly drill her
[01:58.83]A big hole in the skull to fill with gasoline
[02:01.25]Light a match and watch the fire sprinkle out what a scene
[02:03.96]I would be happy oh so happy, by the time I'm done
[02:06.51]I would be running around the house with a taser gun
[02:09.10]And tase all the different body parts, electrifying
[02:11.96]This must be the greatest day ever, no I ain't lying
[02:14.68]As happy as a boy can be
[02:17.07]On his way to puberty, puberty
[02:21.42]
[02:22.81]Dead in the house
[02:27.66]Oh she's dead, dead in the house
[02:32.92]She's dead, dead in the house
[02:38.19]Oh she's dead
[02:40.86]Spread out she's all over the place in the house
[02:49.01]And she's dead
[02:53.49]
[02:59.90]End
