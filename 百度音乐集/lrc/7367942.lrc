[01:17.17]outside
[01:21.97]the storm clouds gathering,
[01:29.93]moved silently along the dusty boulevard.
[01:42.72]where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
[01:55.64]so they can in turn
[01:58.69]reach up and kiss the sky.
[02:07.12]they are driven by a strange desire
[02:15.15]
[02:20.26]unseen by the human eye
[02:28.64]someone is calling.
