[00:18.24]I believe for every drop of rain that falls
[00:25.40]A flower grows
[00:30.92]I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
[00:38.01]A candle glows
[00:43.72]I believe for everyone who goes astray
[00:51.18]Someone will come to show the way
[01:00.62]I believe
[01:04.00]oh~ I believe
[01:17.38]I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
[01:24.80]Will still be heard
[01:30.16]I believe that someone in the great somewhere
[01:37.38]Hears every word
[01:42.94]Every time I hear a new born baby cry
[01:50.12]Or touch a leaf or see the sky
[01:58.60]Then I know why
[02:02.21]I believe
[02:08.22]
[02:08.34]Every time I hear a new born baby cry
[02:15.40]Or touch a leaf or see the sky
[02:24.00]Then I know why
[02:29.50]I believe~
