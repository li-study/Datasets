[00:28.38]They asked me how I knew my true love was true.
[00:37.50]Oh,
[00:39.60]I of course replied
[00:43.50]"something here inside cannot be denied."
[00:55.38]They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind."
[01:04.62]Oh,When your heart's on fire,
[01:11.06]you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
[02:17.49][01:22.78]So I chaffed them
[02:20.07][01:25.94]and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love.
[02:31.23][01:36.72]Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love.
[02:45.01][01:50.39]Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide. Oh,
[02:56.87][02:02.08]So I smile and say
[03:00.38][02:05.30]"when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes!"
[03:44.50][03:16.50]smoke gets in your eyes
[04:00.74][03:40.09]
[03:51.59](smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes)
