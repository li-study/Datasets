[00:05.50]
[00:06.43]My best friend gave me the best advice
[00:12.10]He said each day's a gift and not a given right
[00:16.50]Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
[00:23.50]And try to take the path less traveled by
[00:27.18]That first step you take is the longest stride
[00:33.32]
[00:35.62]If today was your last day
[00:39.33]And tomorrow was too late
[00:40.64]Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
[00:45.41]Would you live each moment like your last
[00:48.54]Leave old pictures in the past?
[00:51.33]Donate every dime you had
[00:57.69]If today was your last day?
[01:00.01]
[01:05.52](What if, what if, if today was your last day?)
[01:10.16]
[01:10.33]Against the grain should be a way of life
[01:16.80]What's worth the price is always worth the fight
[01:20.58]Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
[01:27.37]So live like you'll never live it twice
[01:31.41]Don't take the free ride in your own life
[01:37.72]
[01:39.50]If today was your last day
[01:41.97]And tomorrow was too late
[01:44.46]Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
[01:49.29]Would you live each moment like your last?
[01:52.62]Leave old pictures in the past?
[01:55.36]Donate every dime you had?
[01:59.53]
[02:00.27]And would you call those friends you never see?
[02:03.31]Reminisce old memories?
[02:05.93]Would you forgive your enemies?
[02:11.00]And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
[02:13.60]Swear up and down to God above
[02:16.41]That you'd finally fall in love
[02:22.38]If today was your last day?
[02:24.98]
[02:27.40]If today was your last day
[02:29.88]Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
[02:37.40]You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
[02:43.62]Regardless of who you are
[02:48.17]
[02:48.22]So do whatever it takes
[02:51.55]'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
[02:58.81]Let nothin' stand in your way
[03:02.05]Cause the hands of time are never on your side
[03:09.73]
[03:10.20]If today was your last day
[03:13.05]And tomorrow was too late
[03:15.04]Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
[03:20.33]Would you live each moment like your last?
[03:23.23]Leave old pictures in the past?
[03:25.93]Donate every dime you had?
[03:29.50]
[03:30.89]And would you call those friends you never see?
[03:34.03]Reminisce old memories?
[03:36.44]Would you forgive your enemies?
[03:41.49]And would you find that one you're dreamin' of
[03:44.29]Swear up and down to God above
[03:46.94]That you'd finally fall in love
[03:52.64]If today was your last day?
