[00:01.56]Desert Rose
[00:02.39]Sting
[00:03.63]
[00:54.60]I dream of rain
[00:58.93]I dream of gardens in the desert sand
[01:03.17]I wake in pain
[01:07.41]I dream of love as time runs through my hand
[01:11.76]I dream of fire
[01:16.04]Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
[01:20.48]And in the flames
[01:24.58]Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
[01:28.79]This desert rose
[01:33.10]Each of her veils a secret promise
[01:37.67]This desert flower
[01:40.89]No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
[01:45.11]And as she turns
[01:50.23]This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
[01:54.77]This fire burns
[01:58.72]I realise that nothing's as it seems
[02:03.15]I dream of rain
[02:06.93]I dream of gardens in the desert sand
[02:11.66]I wake in pain
[02:15.25]I dream of love as time runs through my hand
[02:20.26]I dream of rain
[02:24.52]I lift my gaze to empty skies above
[02:28.72]I close my eyes, this rare perfume
[02:32.13]Is the sweet intoxication of her love
[02:39.00]
[03:11.87]I dream of rain
[03:15.49]I dream of gardens in the desert sand
[03:20.22]I wake in pain
[03:24.51]I dream of love as time runs through my hand
[03:28.79]Sweet desert rose
[03:32.67]Each of her veils, a secret promise
[03:37.35]This desert flower
[03:41.20]No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
[03:46.10]Sweet desert rose
[03:50.22]This memory of Eden haunts us all
[03:54.28]This desert flower,this rare perfume
[03:57.58]Is the sweet intoxication of the fall
[04:05.24]
