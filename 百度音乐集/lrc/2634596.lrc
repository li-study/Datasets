[00:08.55]The battle line is drawn, it's all in black and white.
[00:13.61]Hope is pulling forward, can feel it from behind, it's time.
[00:21.61]It's time to make a move, so what will you decide?
[00:26.53]The clock is ticking on, don't let it pass you by, it's time.
[00:34.80]It's time.
[02:55.99][01:40.60][00:38.23]The time is now, for lifting souls.
[03:00.14][01:45.38][00:42.56]The time is now, for letting go.

[01:29.07]Let's lead the resistance,
[01:31.29]Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, it's time.

[03:14.04][01:59.27]It's time to make a stand,

[03:21.96][02:07.02]From your skin, to your core,
[02:21.26]Sisters, Brothers, thieves, and lovers,
[02:30.14]Come on, come on, eternity
[02:39.38]Turn your faces, with fine eyed places,
[02:48.32]Heaven's grace will set you free.
[04:11.78]Oh, come rushing through the door...
