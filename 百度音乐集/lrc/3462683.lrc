[00:10.81]Every point of view has another angle
[00:15.99]And every angle has its merit
[00:19.19]But all comes down to faith
[00:23.13]Thats the way I see it
[00:26.42]
[00:29.68]You can say that love is not divine and
[00:34.14]You can say that life is not eternal
[00:38.33]all we have is know"
[00:41.99]But I don't believe it
[00:46.26]
[00:47.43]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[00:52.21]And the restless soul is searching
[00:56.72]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[01:01.50]And it's a void only he can fill
[01:09.73]
[01:17.11]Does the world seem gray with empty longing
[01:21.53]Wearing every shade of cynical
[01:25.43]And do you ever feel that
[01:29.42]There is something missing
[01:34.88]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[01:39.14]And the restless soul is searching
[01:43.95]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[01:48.38]And it's a void only he can fill
[01:58.03]That's my point of view...
[02:02.17]
[02:22.36]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[02:26.76]And the restless soul is searching
[02:31.37]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[02:36.05]And it's a void
[02:41.00]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[02:46.00]And the restless soul is searching
[02:50.39]There's a god shaped hole in all of us
[02:55.21]And it's a void only he can fill
[03:04.26]Only he can fill
[03:09.10]That's my point of view...
[03:36.83]

[03:41.57]Fade out...
