[00:12.55]Baby slow down
[00:18.04]The end is not as fun as the start
[00:23.44]Please stay a child somewhere in your heart
[00:33.99][02:02.01]I'll give you everything you want
[00:39.43][02:07.29]Except the thing that you want
[00:45.07][02:13.06]You are the first one of your kind
[00:54.49][02:22.48][03:50.49]And you feel like no-one before
[01:00.27][02:28.28][03:56.51]You steal right under my door
[01:05.76]And I kneel 'cause I want you some more
[01:11.45][02:39.46]I want the lot of what you got
[01:14.17][02:42.16]And I want nothing that you're not
[01:18.47][02:46.30][03:30.20][03:41.07]Everywhere you go you shout it
[01:23.54][03:35.84]You don't have to be shy about it
[01:40.35]Some things you shouldn't get too good at
[01:45.34]Like smiling, crying and celebrity
[01:51.00]Some people got way too much confidence baby, baby
[02:33.71][04:01.68]I kneel 'cause I want you some more
[02:51.63]You don't have to be shy about it, no
[03:18.19]Come on now show your soul
[03:22.54]You've been keeping your love under control
[03:47.21]Oh my my
[04:07.56]I want you some more, I want you some more...
