[00:00.02]'TIL KINGDOM COME
[00:01.05]One... two...
[00:09.85]Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
[00:17.94]I feel my time... my time has come
[00:25.87]Let me in... unlock the door
[00:34.94]I never felt this way before
[00:41.32]
[00:43.10]And the wheels just keep on turning
[00:47.43]The drummer begins to drum
[00:51.44]I don't know which way I'm going
[00:55.66]I don't know which way I've come
[00:59.42]
[01:09.49]Hold my head... inside your hands
[01:17.56]I need someone... who understands
[01:26.40]I need someone... someone who hears
[01:33.38]For you I've waited all these years
[01:39.28]
[01:39.70]For you I'd wait... 'Til Kingdom Come
[01:43.58]Until my day... my day is done
[01:56.28]and say you'll come... and set me free
[02:04.60]just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
[02:12.45]
[02:21.65]In your tears... and in your blood
[02:29.90]In your fire... and in your flood
[02:38.06]I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
[02:45.37]I wouldn't change a single thing
[02:49.55]
[02:50.58]And the wheels just keep on turning
[02:54.70]The drummers begin to drum
[02:58.82]I don't know which way I'm going
[03:02.90]I don't know what I've become
[03:07.60]
[03:08.18]For you I'd wait... 'Til kingdom come
[03:16.58]Until my days... my days are done
[03:25.03]Say you'll come... and set me free
[03:33.59]Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
[03:41.40]
[03:42.05]Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
[03:46.32]Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
