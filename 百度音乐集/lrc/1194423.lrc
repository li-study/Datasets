[00:09.38]THE KILLERS LYRICS
[00:10.42]
[00:11.26]When You Were Young
[00:11.90]
[00:19.64]You sit there in your heartache
[00:22.64]Waiting on some beautiful boy to
[00:26.59]To save you from your old ways
[00:30.16]You play forgiveness
[00:31.74]Watch it now
[00:32.73]Here he comes
[00:33.34]
[00:33.92]He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
[00:37.12]But he talks like a gentleman
[00:39.17]Like you imagined
[00:40.95]When you were young
[00:41.97]
[00:48.66]Can we climb this mountain
[00:50.80]I dont know
[00:52.16]Higher now than ever before
[00:55.19]I know we can make it if we take it slow
[00:59.39]Let's take it easy
[01:01.18]Easy now
[01:02.16]Watch it go
[01:03.09]
[01:03.48]We're burning down the highway skyline
[01:06.28]On the back of a hurricane
[01:08.68]That started turning
[01:10.23]When you were young
[01:17.64]When you were young
[01:21.61]
[01:25.09]And sometimes you close your eyes
[01:27.55]And see the place where you used to live
[01:31.37]When you were young
[01:35.64]
[01:56.23]They say the devil's water
[01:58.48]It ain't so sweet
[02:00.40]You dont have to drink right now
[02:04.73]But you can dip your feet
[02:08.09]Every once in a little while
[02:15.04]
[02:35.33]You sit there in your heartache
[02:38.41]Waiting on some beautiful boy to
[02:42.48]To save you from your old ways
[02:45.69]You play forgiveness
[02:47.10]Watch it now
[02:48.19]Here he comes
[02:49.21]
[02:49.98]He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
[02:52.65]But he talks like a gentleman
[02:54.87]Like you imagined
[02:56.49]When you were young
[03:00.52](Talks like a gentleman)
[03:02.24](Like you imagined)
[03:03.82]When you were young
[03:08.43]
[03:11.20]I said he doesnt look a thing like Jesus
[03:18.95]He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
[03:29.41]But more than you'll ever know
