[00:01.12]Manchester Orchestra - I Can Feel A Hot One
[00:03.43]
[00:07.87]I could feel a hot one taking me down
[00:11.47]For a moment, I could feel the force
[00:15.72]Fainted to the point of tears
[00:18.99]And you were holding on to make a point
[00:22.96]What's the point?
[00:25.24]
[00:30.98]I'm but a clean man, stable and alone man
[00:35.04]Make it so I won't have to try
[00:38.79]The faces always stay the same
[00:42.28]So I face the fact that I'm just fine
[00:45.37]I said that I'm just fine
[00:48.24]
[00:54.21]I remember, head down,
[00:56.35]After you had found out
[00:58.22]Manna is a hell of a drug
[01:02.08]And I need a little more, I think
[01:05.35]Because enough is never quite enough
[01:09.27]What's enough?
[01:15.61]
[01:17.38]I took it like a grown man crying on the pavement
[01:21.40]Hoping you would show your face
[01:25.22]But I haven't heard a thing you've said
[01:28.68]In at least a couple hundred days
[01:32.41]What'd you say?
[01:35.96]
[01:40.64]I was in the front seat, shaking it out
[01:44.29]And I was asking if you felt alright
[01:48.40]I never want to hear the truth
[01:51.72]I want to hear your voice, it sounded fine
[01:54.80]My voice, it sounded fine
[01:59.28]
[02:03.92]I could feel my heartbeat taking me down
[02:07.36]And for the moment, I would sleep alright
[02:11.56]I'm dealing with a selfish fear
[02:14.88]To keep me up another restless night
[02:18.00]Another restless night
[02:22.96]
[02:27.13]The blood was dry, it was sober
[02:30.81]The feeling of audible cracks
[02:36.73]And I could tell it was over
[02:40.21]From the curtains that hung from your neck
[02:45.53]
[02:46.38]And I realized that then you were perfect
[02:49.77]And my teeth ripping out of my head
[02:53.97]And it looked like a painting I once knew
[02:57.02]Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact
[03:03.13]
[03:03.61]To pray for what I thought were angels
[03:07.60]Ended up being ambulances
[03:13.37]And the Lord showed me dreams of my daughter
[03:16.94]She was crying inside your stomach
[03:21.33]
[03:23.11]And I felt love again
[03:39.73]
