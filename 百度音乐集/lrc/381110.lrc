[00:14.40]Would you know my name
[00:21.40]If I saw you in heaven?
[00:26.46]Would you be the same
[00:32.73]If I saw you in heaven?
[00:39.00]I must be strong and carry on,
[00:49.90]Because I know I don't belong here in heaven.
[00:58.36]
[01:09.98]Would you hold my hand
[01:15.90]If I saw you in heaven?
[01:22.50]Would you help me stand
[01:29.04]If I saw you in heaven?
[01:35.25]I'll find my way through night and day,
[01:45.72]Because I know I just can't stand here in heaven.
[01:54.90]
[02:07.00]Time can bring you down,
[02:09.22]Time can bend your knees,
[02:13.16]
[02:15.29]Time can break your heart.
[02:22.80]Have you begging please,
[02:27.00]Begging please.
[02:31.90]
[02:57.15]Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
[03:06.71]And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.
[03:15.60]
[03:28.20]Would you know my name
[03:34.60]If I saw you in heaven?
[03:40.14]Would you be the same
[03:46.39]If I saw you in heaven?
[03:53.32]I must be strong and carry on,
[04:03.14]Because I know I don't belong here in heaven.
