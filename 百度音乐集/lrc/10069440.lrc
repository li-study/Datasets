[00:04.00]Michael Jackson
[00:06.50]
[00:54.42]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:00.78]It's not warm when she's away
[01:07.10]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:10.61]And she's always gone too long
[01:13.62]Anytime she goes away
[01:20.02]Wonder this time where she's gone
[01:26.64]Wonder if she's gone to stay
[01:32.77]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:36.07]And this house just ain't no home
[01:39.13]Anytime she goes away
[01:42.38]
[01:48.43]And I know, I know...
[02:02.11]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[02:10.90]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[02:17.51]Only darkness everyday
[02:23.23]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[02:26.62]And this house just ain't no home
[02:29.63]Anytime she goes away
[02:38.85]Anytime she goes away
[02:54.58]Anytime she goes away
[03:00.92]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[03:10.20]It's not warm when she's away
