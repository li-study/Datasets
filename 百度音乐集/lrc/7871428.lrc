[00:00.05]Dream Theater - Take The Time Lyrics
[01:08.05]"Hold it now... wait a minute... come on... whew..."
[01:11.05]Just let me catch my breath...
[01:14.05]I've heard the promises　I've seen the mistakes
[01:17.05]I've had my fair share of tough breaks
[01:19.05]I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
[01:22.05]Take the time, reevaluate
[01:25.05]It's time to pick up the pieces, Go back to square one
[01:29.05]I think it's time for a change
[01:44.05]There is something that I feel
[01:47.05]To be something that is real
[01:50.05]I feel the heat within my mind
[01:54.05]And craft new changes with my eyes
[01:57.05]Giving freely wandering promises
[02:01.05]A place with decisions I'll fashion
[02:04.05]I won't waste another breath
[02:06.05]
[02:10.05]You can feel the waves coming on
[02:13.05](It's time to take the time)
[02:16.05]Let them destroy you or carry you on
[02:19.05](It's time to take the time)
[02:22.05]You're fighting the weight of the world
[02:24.05]But no one can save you this time
[02:28.05]Close your eyes　You can find all you need in your mind
[02:32.05]
[02:34.05]The unbroken spirit　Obscured and disquiet　Finds clearness this trial demands
[02:40.05]And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
[02:43.05]For the fortune lies still in his hands
[02:47.05]If there's pensive fear, a wasted year
[02:51.05]A man must learn to cope
[02:53.05]If his obsession's real, suppression that he feels must turn to hope
[03:00.05]Life is no more assuring than love
[03:03.05](It's time to take the time)
[03:07.05]There are no answers from voices above
[03:10.05](It's time to take the time)
[03:13.05]You're fighting the weight of the world
[03:15.05]And no one can save you this time
[03:18.05]Close your eyes　You can find all you need in your mind
[03:23.05]
[03:25.05]I close my eyes
[03:28.05]And feel the water rise around me
[03:31.05]Drown the bear of time
[03:35.05]Let my senses fall away
[03:38.05]I can see much clearer now, I'm blind
[03:44.05]"Adesso che ho perso la vista, ci vedo meglio e di piu"
[03:47.05]
[06:03.05]You can feel the waves coming on
[06:06.05](It's time to take the time)
[06:10.05]Let them destroy you or carry you on
[06:13.05](It's time to take the time)
[06:16.05]You're fighting the weight of the world
[06:18.05]But no one can save you this time
[06:21.05]Close your eyes　You can find all you need in your mind
[06:31.05]
[07:15.05]Find all you need in your mind　If you take the time
[07:25.05]Find all you need in your mind　If you take the time
[07:33.05]
