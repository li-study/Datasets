[00:00.46]It's Going To Take Some Time
[00:07.06] Carpenters
[00:13.06]
[00:15.01]It's going to take some time this time
[00:18.76]To get myself in shape
[00:23.14]I really fell outta line this time
[00:27.45]I really missed the gate
[00:31.39]The birds on the telephone line (this time)
[00:35.58]Are crying out to me (this time)
[00:39.46]And I won't be so blind next time
[00:43.49]And I'll find some harmony
[00:46.83]
[00:47.59]And it's going to take some time this time
[00:52.14]And that keep me demays
[00:55.71]And like the young trees in the winter time
[01:00.31]I'll learn how to bend
[01:04.81]After all the tears we've spend
[01:08.08]How could we make amends
[01:12.00]So it's one more round for experience
[01:16.29]And I'm on the road again
[01:20.35]And it's going to take some time,
[01:24.11]This time
[01:29.11]And that keep me demays
[01:37.46]I'll learn how to bend
[01:40.82]
[01:57.88]And it's going to take some time this time
[02:01.59]No matter what I plan
[02:05.29]And like the young trees in the winter time
[02:09.88]I'll learn how to bend
[02:13.84]After all the tears we've spend
[02:17.13]How could we make amends
[02:21.00]So it's one more round for experience
[02:25.14]And I'm on the road again...
[02:29.34]And it's going to take some time
[02:33.03]This time
