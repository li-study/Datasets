[00:17.54]It's undeniable how brilliant you are
[00:23.18]In an unreliable world you shine like a star
[00:28.44]It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
[00:33.69]It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
[00:37.96]
[00:38.16]February 5th, Friday morning, purple dawn
[00:40.48]Broke a yawn, as a I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
[00:43.85]A moment like a poem, you wish you could hold it
[00:46.32]I shut my eyes like it's frozen, it's gone when I open
[00:49.37]It slipped passed the clouds right there where it lingered
[00:51.92]Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
[00:54.62]My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
[00:57.42]ON a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning
[00:59.86]If only I could touch past the phony
[01:02.57]If only they were there now to hold me
[01:04.13]As the questions keep droning
[01:05.27]
[01:05.46]You're the only one who stuck it out last night
[01:07.98]The only other one who caught the other line
[01:10.54]You're the only one when this world collides
[01:13.24]The one that I can't deny
[01:15.42]
[01:17.08]It's undeniable how brilliant you are
[01:21.72]In an unreliable world you shine like a star
[01:27.03]It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
[01:31.25]It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
[01:37.26]
[01:47.87]It's my last year here
[01:49.06]My first class moved to portable 'a'
[01:50.81]Under construction since summer
[01:52.71]And it's cold today
[01:53.89]I can see my breath, and what's left of the west parking lot
[01:56.92]And all the spaces that we fought
[01:58.58]And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
[02:00.95]In past piles of rubble, in puddles of rain water
[02:03.86]That hurt last night when I left like that
[02:06.42]When I won't come back
[02:07.85]Speaking my peace to the past
[02:09.55]I can't help but wonder, who is this wind at my back
[02:11.93]A whisper to walk on, come on from all that
[02:14.66]You're the only one who stuck it out last night
[02:17.50]The only other one who caught the other line
[02:20.12]You're the only one when this world collides
[02:22.80]The one that I can't deny
[02:26.00]It's undeniable how brilliant you are
[02:31.44]In an unreliable world you shine like a star
[02:36.28]It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
[02:41.39]It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
[02:46.42]
[02:58.07]How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind
[03:02.80]You found me on a summer breeze
[03:08.72]How am I gonna run away when the autom breaks
[03:13.74]Now that you found me in the spring
[03:17.46]Come on and sing it out
[03:19.43]It's undeniable how brilliant you are
[03:24.70]In an unreliable world you shine like a star
[03:30.10]It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
[03:35.03]It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
[03:40.46]It's undeniable how brilliant you are
[03:45.91]In an unreliable world you shine like a star
[03:51.17]It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
[03:56.38]It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
