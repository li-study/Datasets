[02:32.37]And as I head through the woods on the way back
[02:36.28]The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty
[02:40.33]It's like I'm walked into a glade of heaven
[02:44.11]And there's music playing
[02:45.82]This money is cold in my hand
[02:48.01]And a voice somewhere is saying
