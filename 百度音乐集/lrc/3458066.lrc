[00:00.00]A Million Miles Away
[00:03.55]
[00:16.54]Here we lay face to face once again
[00:24.40]Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
[00:30.98]And I'm wondering who will be the first
[00:34.84]to say what we both know
[00:38.56]We're just holding on to could have beens
[00:42.31]and we should be letting go
[00:46.05]
[00:47.30]It feels like you're a million miles away
[00:51.57]as you're lying here with me tonight
[00:55.30]I can't even find the words to say
[00:59.25]I can find a way to make it right
[01:02.71]And we both know that the story's ending
[01:06.52]We play the part but we're just pretending
[01:10.77]and I can't hide the tears
[01:12.78]'cause even though you're here
[01:14.94]It feels like you're a million miles away
[01:19.45]
[01:22.36]away...
[01:24.63]
[01:26.37]Was it me, or was it you that broke away
[01:34.67]For what we were
[01:36.02]is like a season love is change
[01:40.58]And every time I think about it
[01:44.39]it tears me up inside
[01:48.24]Like the rivers of emotion
[01:51.98]but I got no more tears to cry
[01:56.46]
[01:57.10]It feels like you're a million miles away
[02:01.51]as you're lying here with me tonight
[02:04.97]I can't even find the words to say
[02:08.99]I can find a way to make it right
[02:12.16]And we both know that the story's ending
[02:16.13]We play the part but we're just pretending
[02:21.22]and I can't hide the tears
[02:22.47]'cause even though you're here
[02:24.65]It feels like you're a million miles away
[02:31.26]away...
[02:54.06]We can try to talk it over
[02:57.90]but we walked that road before
[03:01.65]While our song is playing its last note
[03:05.75]We both know for sure
[03:10.12]that it's time to close that door
[03:14.09]
[03:14.91]It feels like you're a million miles away
[03:18.69]as you're lying here with me tonight
[03:22.64]I can't even find the words to say
[03:26.30]I can find a way to make it right
[03:29.81]And we both know that the story's ending
[03:33.59]We play the part but we're just pretending
[03:37.90]and I can't hide the tears
[03:39.92]'cause even though you're here
[03:41.99]It feels like you're a million miles away..
[03:47.65]..
[03:54.21]a million miles away.
