[00:24.01]Care about the moonlight
[00:27.02]and holding you tight
[00:29.13]and asking my questions.
[00:32.81]Everyone loves a situation.
[00:40.43]Long walks on the beach.
[00:43.63]The press will impeach.
[00:45.96]Lately I\'m finding
[00:49.22]I am the book and you are the binding.
[00:57.53]I guess they\'ll read everything about you.
[01:08.73]Though the press miht shoot me down
[01:12.79]I\'m still true.
[01:17.38]I sell my book for free.
[01:23.74]That\'s what you do to me.
[01:28.92]
[01:29.84]Oh, you are you are you are my family tree.
[01:38.66]Be good to me
[01:43.06]Take care of me.

[02:02.58]There\'s hotels in the sea,
[02:05.85]Trash in the sky,
[02:08.04]The net-dustry\'s growing.
[02:11.35]Stick to love songs kid,
[02:14.35]that\'s all you\'re knowing.
[02:19.06]They push you away
[02:22.33]or tie you up.
[02:24.71]It don\'t really matter.
[02:27.97]But if your head is up you won\'t get much sadder.
[02:36.79]But who am I to preach a word or two
[02:47.33]when I can\'t even lift my own head without you?
[02:56.53]In my mental state kept you from coming around
[03:06.94]I hope the world would shoot me down for losing you.
[03:16.79]A broken branch I\'d be
[03:22.34]if you weren\'t grown to me.
[03:28.55]Oh, you are you are you are my family tree
[03:37.36]Be good to me
[03:41.85]Be good to me
[03:45.84]Be good to me
[03:50.56]Take care of me.
