[00:01.48]Natasha Bedingfield - Not Givin' Up
[00:03.74]
[00:06.00]Rubbing salt in my wounds
[00:08.52]Like it don't hurt, like it don't hurt me
[00:13.26]Your sweet bitter love songs
[00:15.76]That seduce me with a sinister beat
[00:22.17]I'm bringing out the worst in you
[00:24.06]It was never my intention to
[00:25.80]That was just unfair to do
[00:28.39]Salt in my wounds
[00:30.78]Getting burned up
[00:32.67]With the negative heat
[00:36.79]How can I stay mad with you?
[00:43.05]When I'm so in love with you
[00:49.53]Oh yeah yeah
[00:51.32]Oh oh oh
[00:53.18]I don't know what we argue about
[00:54.79]Oh oh oh
[00:56.25]When all we do is scream and shout
[00:58.49]I still believe in our love right now
[01:00.64]And its gonna work out some how
[01:02.43]You and me we got common ground
[01:04.19]I'm not giving up, no
[01:05.07]Are you looking for a way out?
[01:08.34]Are you looking for an exit?
[01:12.64]It seems like all the fuss you're making
[01:15.23]Is a sign that you're not quite sure
[01:18.80]Well, I don't recommend you to
[01:21.39]Coz what we got's to good to lose
[01:23.22]And I can tell you know that too
[01:25.81]Or is it just aggravation
[01:27.96]You're picking on me
[01:29.91]You're rubbing salt in my wounds
[01:34.53]How can I stay mad with you?
[01:41.94]When I'm so in love with you
[01:48.68]Oh oh oh
[01:49.86]I don't know what we argue about
[01:51.86]Oh oh oh
[01:53.24]When all we do is scream and shout
[01:55.66]I still believe in our love right now
[01:57.65]And its gonna work out some work
[01:59.42]You and me we got common ground
[02:01.26]I'm not giving up, no
[02:03.22]Oh oh oh
[02:04.42]I don't know what we argue about
[02:06.72]Oh oh oh
[02:08.47]When all we do is scream and shout
[02:10.47]I still believe in our love right now
[02:12.28]And its gonna work out some work
[02:14.02]You and me we got common ground
[02:16.09]I'm not giving up, no
[02:17.85]Maybe just a kind word now and then
[02:21.01]Could turn it around and make us a happy end
[02:24.42]But if this is it and the moment is gone
[02:28.23]Well then I guess I must have just got it wrong
[02:31.86]Wise as it sounds it just doesn't make sense
[02:35.24]And as long as it takes I'm gonna keep on trying
[02:41.40]Coz I'm not giving up on us
[02:43.60]I'm not giving up, no
[02:45.96]How can I stay mad with you?
[02:51.86]I'm not giving up, no
[02:53.61]When I'm so in love with you
[02:59.74]Oh oh oh
[03:01.89]I don't know what we argue about
[03:04.13]Oh oh oh
[03:05.78]When all we do is scream and shout
[03:07.71]I still believe in our love right now
[03:09.52]And its gonna work out some work
[03:11.60]You and me we got common ground
[03:13.32]I'm not giving up, no
[03:19.70]No way, no way
[03:21.20]I'm not giving up, no
[03:26.92]No way, no way
[03:28.40]I'm not giving up, no
[03:31.95]End
