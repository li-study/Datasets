[00:00.00]Self Control
[00:16.00]
[00:17.57]Oh, the night is my world
[00:22.07]City light painted girl
[00:26.08]In the day nothing matters
[00:30.93]It's the night time that flatters
[00:35.47]In the night, no control
[00:39.95]Through the wall something's breaking
[00:44.22]Wearing white as you're walkin'
[00:48.95]Down the street of my soul
[00:53.00]
[00:54.57]You take my self, you take my self control
[00:58.95]You got me livin' only for the night
[01:03.42]Before the morning comes, the story's told
[01:07.90]You take my self, you take my self control
[01:11.00]
[01:12.47]Another night, another day goes by
[01:16.97]I never stop myself to wonder why
[01:21.44]You help me to forget to play my role
[01:25.90]You take my self, you take my self control
[01:28.00]
[01:29.49]I, I live among the creatures of the night
[01:36.58]I haven't got the will to try and fight
[01:41.36]Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
[01:45.67]That tomorrow never comes
[01:46.00]
[01:47.22]A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
[01:54.53]I know the night is not as it would seem
[01:58.90]I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
[02:03.08]That this night will never go
[02:04.00]
[02:05.15]Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[02:14.08]Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[02:17.00]
[02:18.70]Oh, the night is my world
[02:23.10]City light painted girl
[02:27.61]In the day nothing matters
[02:32.11]It's the night time that flatters
[02:36.00]
[02:37.39]I, I live among the creatures of the night
[02:43.88]I haven't got the will to try and fight
[02:48.45]Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
[02:52.83]That tomorrow never knows
[02:53.00]
[02:54.53]A safe night, I'm living in the forest of a dream
[03:01.87]I know the night is not as it would seem
[03:06.26]I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
[03:10.38]That this night will never go
[03:11.00]
[03:12.54]Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[03:22.63]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:27.06]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:31.53]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:36.06]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:40.55]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:45.02]You take my self, you take my self control
[03:49.64]You take my self, you take my self control
