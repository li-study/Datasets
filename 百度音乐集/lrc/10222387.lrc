[00:02.83]送给我最爱的人
[00:12.20]If he brings you happiness,
[00:17.33]Then I wish you all the best.
[00:22.59]It's your happiness that matters
[00:27.58]Most of all.
[00:33.03]But if he ever breaks your heart,
[00:38.30]If the teardrops ever start,
[00:42.63]I'll be there
[00:45.27]Before the next teardrop falls.
[00:54.16]Si te quiere de verdad,
[00:59.42]Y te da felicidad,
[01:04.91]Te deseo lo mas bueno pa' los dos.
[01:15.41]Pero si te hace llorar,
[01:20.51]A mi me puedes hablar.
[01:25.38]Y estare contigo cuando triste estas.
[01:35.53]I'll be there
[01:39.14]Anytime you need me
[01:43.99]By your side
[01:47.62]To dry away
[01:51.65]Any teardrops that you cry.
[01:56.96]And if he ever leaves you blue,
[02:02.39]Just remember - I love you.
[02:06.52]And I'll be there
[02:09.50]Before the next teardrop falls.
[02:16.98]I'll be there
[02:20.27]Before the next teardrop falls
[02:20.35]愿上帝保佑你永远快乐！
