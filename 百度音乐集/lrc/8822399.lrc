[01:25]I got a Black Magic Woman.
[01:29]I got a Black Magic Woman.
[01:34]Yes, I got a Black Magic Woman,
[01:36]She's got me so blind I can't see;
[01:42]But she's a Black Magic Woman and
[01:44]she's trying to make a devil out of me.
[01:49]Don't turn your back on me, baby.
[01:52]Don't turn your back on me, baby.
[01:57]Yes, don't turn your back on me, baby,
[02:00]Don't mess around with your tricks;
[02:05]Don't turn your back on me, baby,
[02:07]'cause you might just wake up my magic sticks.
[02:58]You got your spell on me, baby.
[03:02]You got your spell on me, baby.
[03:06]Yes, you got your spell on me, baby,
[03:09]Turnin' my heart into stone;
[03:15]I need you so bad,
[03:17]Magic Woman I can't leave you alone.
