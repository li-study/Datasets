[00:01.92]Time To Pretend
[00:04.99]Mgmt
[00:07.56]
[00:29.63]I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw,
[00:32.52]I'm in the prime of my life.
[00:39.08]Let's make some music, make some money,
[00:41.64]find some models for wives.
[00:48.58]I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin,
[00:51.19]and fuck with the stars.
[00:58.10]You man the island and the cocaine
[01:00.92]and the elegant cars.
[01:03.38]
[01:07.29]This is our decision,
[01:09.32]to live fast and die young.
[01:12.35]We've got the vision,
[01:14.22]now let's have some fun.
[01:17.27]
[01:26.25]Yeah, it's overwhelming,
[01:28.50]but what else can we do.
[01:31.47]Get jobs in offices,
[01:33.37]and wake up for the morning commute.
[01:36.30]
[01:45.96]Forget about our mothers and our friends
[01:52.21]We're fated to pretend
[01:58.36]To pretend
[02:01.72]We're fated to pretend
[02:07.83]To pretend
[02:09.66]
[02:14.18]I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals
[02:17.43]and digging up worms
[02:23.55]I'll miss the comfort of my mother
[02:26.20]and the weight of the world
[02:33.15]I'll miss my sister, miss my father,
[02:35.77] miss my dog and my home
[02:41.99]Yeah, I'll miss the boredem and the freedom
[02:45.31]and the time spent alone.
[02:47.44]
[02:51.74]There's really nothing, nothing we can do
[02:56.61]Love must be forgotten,
[02:58.86]life can always start up anew.
[03:10.67]The models will have children,
[03:13.17]we'll get a divorce
[03:15.59]We'll find some more models,
[03:17.97]everyting must run it's course.
[03:21.49]
[03:29.74]We'll choke on our vomit
[03:32.07]and that will be the end
[03:36.62]We were fated to pretend
[03:42.97]To pretend
[03:46.30]We're fated to pretend
[03:52.44]To pretend
[03:54.08]

[04:01.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[04:06.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah
