[00:03.06]Maroon 5 - Makes Me Wonder
[00:08.06]
[00:17.52]I wake up with blood-shot eyes
[00:19.24]Struggled to memorize
[00:21.54]The way it felt between your thighs
[00:23.26]Pleasure that made you cry
[00:24.26]
[00:25.96]Feels so good to be bad
[00:27.67]Not worth the aftermath, after that
[00:30.57]After that
[00:31.67]Try to get you back
[00:32.06]
[00:33.89]I still don’t have the reason
[00:37.68]And you don’t have the time
[00:42.05]And it really makes me wonder
[00:44.25]
[00:47.94]Give me something to believe in
[00:49.89]Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
[00:53.33]Anymore
[00:55.44]I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
[01:00.68](Yeah)
[01:01.35]So this is goodbye
[01:02.36]
[01:03.88]God damn my spinning head
[01:05.65]Decisions that made my bed
[01:07.56]Now I must lay in it
[01:09.64]And deal with things I left unsaid
[01:11.06]
[01:12.23]I want to dive into you
[01:13.96]Forget what you’re going through
[01:15.74]I get behind, make your move
[01:17.90]Forget about the truth
[01:19.00]
[01:19.70]I still don’t have the reason
[01:24.42]And you don’t have the time
[01:28.80]And it really makes me wonder
[01:30.37]
[01:33.96]Give me something to believe in
[01:36.14]Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
[01:39.98]Anymore
[01:42.27]I wonder if it even makes a difference,
[01:45.43]It even makes a difference to try
[01:47.06]
[01:50.59]And you talk about how you\'re feeling
[01:52.97]But I don’t believe it’s true anymore
[01:56.43]Anymore
[01:58.64]I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
[02:03.33](Oh no)
[02:04.55]So this is goodbye
[02:06.00]
[02:07.09]I’ve been here before
[02:09.09]One day a week
[02:10.71]And it won’t hurt anymore
[02:13.06]
[02:15.37]You caught me in a lie
[02:17.47]I have no alibi
[02:19.66]The words you say don\'t have a meaning
[02:22.47]Cause
[02:23.06]
[02:23.39]I still don’t have the reason
[02:27.05]And you don’t have the time
[02:31.33]And it really makes me wonder
[02:33.51]
[02:36.39]And I...and so this is goodbye
[02:38.06]
[02:40.86]Give me something to believe in
[02:43.52]Cause I don’t believe in you anymore
[02:47.01]Anymore
[02:49.60]I wonder if it even makes a difference,
[02:52.74]It even makes a difference to try
[02:55.06]
[02:57.82]And you talk about how you\'re feeling
[03:00.35]But I don’t believe it’s true anymore
[03:03.78]Anymore
[03:06.02]I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
[03:10.67](Oh no)
[03:11.83]So this is goodbye
[03:13.26]
[03:15.40](Oh no)
[03:16.16]So this is goodbye, yeah
[03:19.45](Oh no)
[03:20.31]So this is goodbye, yeah
[03:23.25](Oh no)
[03:24.50]So this is goodbye, yeah
