[00:03.19]DIXIE CHICKS "Lullaby"
[00:05.74]
[00:18.46]They didn't have you where I come from
[00:27.19]Never knew the best was yet to come
[00:36.26]Life began when I saw your face
[00:44.70]And I hear your laugh like a serenade
[00:49.95]
[00:54.16]How long do you want to be loved
[01:02.42]Is forever enough, is forever enough
[01:11.73]How long do you want to be loved
[01:20.38]Is forever enough
[01:22.50]Cause I'm never, never giving you up
[01:28.86]
[01:46.35]I slip in bed when you're asleep
[01:53.87]To hold you close and feel your breath on me
[02:02.49]Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
[02:11.02]So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you
[02:18.60]
[02:20.31]How long do you want to be loved
[02:28.69]Is forever enough, is forever enough
[02:37.86]How long do you want to be loved
[02:46.38]Is forever enough
[02:48.33]Cause I'm never, never giving you up
[02:52.40]
[03:42.99]As you wander through this troubled world
[03:51.72]In search of all things beautiful
[04:00.46]You can close your eyes when you're miles away
[04:10.30]And hear my voice like a serenade
[04:15.09]
[04:18.53]How long do you want to be loved
[04:26.74]Is forever enough, is forever enough
[04:35.54]How long do you want to be loved
[04:44.27]Is forever enough
[04:46.17]Cause I'm never, never giving you up
[04:50.18]
[04:50.80]How long do you want to be loved
[04:55.03]Is forever enough, is forever enough
[05:05.96]How long do you want to be loved
[05:14.30]Is forever enough
[05:16.39]Cause I'm never, never giving you up
[05:22.95]Is forever enough
[05:25.33]Cause I'm never, never giving you up
[05:33.90]
