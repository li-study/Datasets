[00:13.00]He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
[00:24.00]I was thirsting for for knowledge and he had a car
[00:35.00]I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
[00:41.00]When one restless summer we found love growing wild
[00:46.00]On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
[00:53.00]Funny how those memories they last
[00:57.00]Like strawberry wine and seventeen
[01:03.00]The hot July moon saw everything
[01:09.00]My first taste of love oh bittersweet
[01:15.00]Green on the vine
[01:20.00]Like strawberry wine
[01:25.00]
[01:29.00]I still remember when thirty was old
[01:41.00]My biggest fear was September when he had to go
[01:51.00]A few cards and letters and one long distance call
[01:57.00]We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
[02:04.00]But year after year I come back to this place
[02:10.00]Just to remember the taste
[02:14.00]Of strawberry wine and seventeen
[02:20.00]The hot July moon saw everything
[02:26.00]My first taste of love oh bittersweet
[02:32.00]Green on the vine
[02:37.00]Like strawberry wine
[02:45.00]The fields have grown over now
[02:48.00]Years since they've seen a plow
[02:51.00]There's nothing time hasn't touched
[02:56.00]Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
[03:03.00]I've been missing so much
[03:06.00]
[03:19.00]Like strawberry wine and seventeen
[03:24.00]The hot July moon saw everything
[03:30.00]My first taste of love oh bittersweet
[03:37.00]Green on the vine
[03:41.00]Like strawberry wine and seventeen
[03:48.00]The hot July moon saw everything
[03:54.00]My first taste of love oh bittersweet
[04:00.00]Green on the vine
[04:05.00]Like strawberry
[04:08.00]
[04:18.00]strawberry
