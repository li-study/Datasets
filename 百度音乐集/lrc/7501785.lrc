[00:01.88]
[00:03.53]It's like a shot through the heart,
[00:06.48]Like a light in the dark,
[00:08.82]That morning when you left me in my bed
[00:12.78]
[00:15.46]And when you walked out the door,
[00:18.10]You said I wouldn't see you anymore,
[00:20.83]And I thought you were joking,
[00:23.43]Now I can't close what you've opened
[00:26.34]
[00:28.00]Gone crazy,
[00:30.71]It's like I've left it too late,
[00:34.08]One wish to have one chance to say
[00:39.15]
[00:39.56]What if I told you that I can't forget you?
[00:42.65]Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
[00:48.07]Cause I remember everything you said.
[00:51.68]And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
[00:54.59]Sometimes I wish I never met you,
[00:57.33]Doesn't matter what I do,
[01:00.19]I'm trying but I can't forget you
[01:03.19]
[01:09.46]If I saw you again,
[01:12.28]Would you wanna just be friends?
[01:14.85]Cause I know I won't feel like this again,
[01:18.92]
[01:21.42]And would you wanna hear me out?
[01:24.13]What would we even talk about?
[01:26.96]Well I'd start with, "I'm sorry, and I wish you'd never left me"
[01:32.31]
[01:34.02]Can't stop this,
[01:37.09]I don't think I'll be saved,
[01:40.07]One wish to have one chance to say
[01:45.35]
[01:45.66]What if I told you that I can't forget you?
[01:48.64]Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
[01:54.06]Cause I remember everything you said.
[01:57.58]And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
[02:00.61]Sometimes I wish I never met you,
[02:03.39]Doesn't matter what I do,
[02:06.15]I'm trying but I can't forget you
[02:09.03]
[02:10.14]Gone crazy,
[02:12.75]It's like I've left it too late,
[02:16.15]One wish to have one chance to say
[02:21.32]
[02:33.62]What if I told you that I can't forget you?
[02:36.48]Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
[02:42.10]Cause I remember everything you said.
[02:45.65]And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
[02:48.68]Sometimes I wish I never met you,
[02:51.36]Doesn't matter what I do,
[02:54.12]I'm trying but I can't forget you
[02:57.13]
[02:57.59]What if I told you that I can't forget you?
[03:00.64]Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
[03:05.92]Girl, I remember everything you said
