[00:06.04]Let me hold you
[00:08.04]For the last time
[00:10.31]It's the last chance to feel again
[00:14.47]But you broke me
[00:16.68]Now I can't feel anything
[00:20.17]
[00:23.04]When I love you,
[00:25.27]It's so untrue
[00:27.27]I can't even convince myself
[00:31.54]When I'm speaking,
[00:33.83]It's the voice of someone else
[00:37.82]
[00:40.12]Oh it tears me up
[00:45.01]I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
[00:49.26]I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay
[00:56.64]
[00:57.15]You can't play on broken strings
[01:01.26]You can't feel anything
[01:05.08]that your heart don't want to feel
[01:09.33]I can't tell you something that ain't real
[01:13.72]
[01:14.10]Oh the truth hurts
[01:16.46]And lies worse
[01:18.72]How can I give anymore
[01:22.40]When I love you a little less than before
[01:29.05]
[01:31.07]Oh what are we doing
[01:35.40]We are turning into dust
[01:39.49]Playing house in the ruins of us
[01:46.80]
[01:48.07]Running back through the fire
[01:52.43]When there's nothing left to save
[01:56.66]It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late
[02:03.51]
[02:05.31]Oh it tears me up
[02:10.04]I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
[02:14.44]I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay
[02:21.97]
[02:22.41]You can't play on broken strings
[02:26.17]You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
[02:35.00]I can't tell something that ain't real
[02:39.70]
[02:40.19]Well the truth hurts,
[02:42.23]And lies worse
[02:44.33]How can I give anymore
[02:48.19]When I love you a little less than before
[02:55.38]
[02:56.83]But we're running through the fire
[03:00.96]When there's nothing left to save
[03:04.92]It's like chasing the very last train
[03:09.56]When we both know it's too late (too late)
[03:15.71]
[03:16.13]You can't play on broken strings
[03:19.92]You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
[03:28.76]I cant tell you something that ain't real
[03:32.89]
[03:33.53]Well truth hurts,
[03:35.82]And lies worse
[03:37.93]How can I give anymore
[03:41.67]When I love you a little less than before
[03:49.61]
[03:59.33]Let me hold you for the last time
[04:03.27]It's the last chance to feel again
[04:08.32]
