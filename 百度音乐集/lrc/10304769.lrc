[00:08.00]Motel sitting in the dark
[00:11.00]Empty room like an empty heart
[00:15.00]Love will start but they never stay
[00:19.00]They don't look back as they drive away
[00:24.00]Maybe I
[00:28.00]Fix this broken head light
[00:32.00]Feeling the cracks and pain arise
[00:35.00]And maybe love will stop here tonite
[00:40.00]And if she knocks on my door
[00:42.00]i'll give her the key
[00:45.00]Just one look in her eyes and i know i'll be
[00:48.00]Everything that she sees in me
[00:52.00]More than i ever thought i could be but
[00:55.00]These are the days
[01:00.00]When all that i can do is dream
[01:03.00]But i don't wanna spend forever
[01:08.00]living in the in between
[01:13.00]I'm stuck here in a place without love
[01:15.00]And i just can't let it stay this way
[01:19.00]But for now i'm gonna have to face it
[01:24.00]These are the days
[01:32.00]Gotta use this lonely time
[01:36.00]To change the picture in my frame of mind
[01:40.00]Outside the window theres a sunny day
[01:44.00]I wanna feel it on my face
[01:48.00]You and I
[01:52.00]Are out looking for the same thing
[01:56.00]And these walls of wondering
[02:00.00]Waiting for someone to share this feeling
[02:04.00]And if she knocks on my door
[02:07.00]i'll give her the key
[02:09.00]Just one look in her eyes and i know i'll be
[02:12.00]Everything that she sees in me

[02:56.00]These are the moments that are still locked here
[03:00.00]There still inside even if she will not hear
[03:04.00]Like it or not this is what i got
