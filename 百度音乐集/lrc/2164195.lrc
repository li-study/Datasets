[00:58.45]I like to go out every now and then
[01:02.30]I can't wait to do it again
[01:06.19]But I haven't had the time
[01:10.81]Lately
[01:14.27]I like to step out every once in a while
[01:18.89]I kind of like to do it in style
[01:22.90]I haven't had the time
[01:26.96]Lately
[01:31.70]Lately I've been stayin' at home
[01:35.60](Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)
[01:39.73]Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone
[01:43.85](Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)
[01:51.71]And I dream I'm on vacation
[01:55.86]'Cause I like the way that sounds
[01:59.98]It's a perfect occupation
[02:04.27]For me
[02:08.90]I don't mind being by myself
[02:12.72]If there's no one else around
[02:16.69]It's the last good time in town
[02:38.59]Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
[02:43.25]Stay up late with the same old mob
[02:47.16]But it hasn't crossed my mind
[02:51.79]Lately
[02:55.97]Put on a suit, work downtown
[03:00.12]Then come up when the sun goes down
[03:03.88]No, I haven't had the time
[03:08.50]Lately
[03:12.70]Lately I've been stayin' at home
[03:20.37](Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)
[03:21.06]Closin' the curtains, play jazz on trombone
[03:24.95](Jazz on trombone, jazz on trombone)
[03:32.55]And I dream I'm on vacation
[03:36.79]No, you won't see me around
[03:41.00]It's a perfect situation
[03:45.37]For me
[03:49.77]I don't mind being by myself
[03:53.68]'Cause I know you'll come on down
[03:57.59]It's the last good time in town
[05:12.71]Lately I've been stayin' at home
[05:16.58](Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)
[05:20.72]Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone
[05:24.88](Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)
[05:32.65]And I dream I'm on vacation
[05:36.68]'Cause I like the way that sounds
[05:40.96]It's a perfect occupation
[05:45.20]For me, yes it is
[05:49.85]I don't mind being by myself
[05:53.75]If you don't see me around
[05:57.75]It's the last good time, last good time in town
