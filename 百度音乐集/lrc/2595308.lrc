[00:10.87]
[00:29.47]Too many sorries went around
[00:38.62]And he became a familiar sound
[00:47.89]Got so tired of the melody
[00:57.13]Melodies were meant to be free
[01:05.83]You got me picking up all my pieces
[01:10.37]Put them back in my pocket
[01:12.93]In case I need them
[01:15.13]Hoping it's not if but when
[01:20.31]Hoping it's not so much later but so soon
[01:26.20]Oh
[01:29.17]
[01:42.76]When we last talked we didn't expect a thing
[01:52.51]Couldn't believe but your love did sting
[02:01.32]If I found myself walking backwards into you
[02:11.18]Would you spill out all your memories too
[02:20.47]We're picking up all our pieces
[02:24.86]Put them back in our pockets and just leave them
[02:29.73]Hoping it's not if but when
[02:34.33]Hoping the same old melody will feel new
[02:41.02]Oh
[02:45.45]
