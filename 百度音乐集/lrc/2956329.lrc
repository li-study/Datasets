[00:04.43]Yea, yea
[00:06.82]Oh ohh
[00:11.95]I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
[00:16.80]I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside
[00:21.88]Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
[00:27.67]And why can't I let go
[00:31.89]There's gotta be more to life...
[00:35.05]Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
[00:42.78]Cause the more that I'm...
[00:45.84]Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
[00:49.41]Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more
[00:55.86]Than wanting more
[01:00.59]I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
[01:05.55]Here in this moment I'm half way out the door
[01:09.96]Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing
[01:16.19]There's gotta be more to life...
[01:19.52]Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
[01:27.08]Cause the more that I'm...
[01:30.18]Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
[01:33.58]Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more
[01:41.79]Than wanting more
[01:48.86]Than waiting on something other than this
[01:52.79]Why am I feelin' like there's something I missed.....
