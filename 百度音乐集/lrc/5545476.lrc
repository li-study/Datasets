[00:16.36]The wind blows,
[00:17.26]Gonna take a field trip,
[00:19.10]Gonna let our minds slip,
[00:21.03]Gonna be warm,
[00:23.76]A new start,
[00:24.81]A life behind the windshield,
[00:26.75]Travel by our own wheels,
[00:28.92]Head over heels,
[00:31.32]And we’ll go with the sun,
[00:39.72]Through all the bliss and all the wonders,
[00:43.59]I’ve got my eyes set on you,
[00:47.50]But if there’s something to be,
[00:51.01]I’ll be something,
[00:52.95]You will be something.
[00:55.58]
[01:10.63]The wind blows,
[01:11.49]Gonna take you outdoors,
[01:13.26]Gonna see the places we’ve never seen,
[01:17.97]The sun shows,
[01:18.92]A day in life of ease goes,
[01:20.90]Travel with the morning in our eyes,
[01:25.34]You’re the summer in my skies,
[01:33.95]Through all the bliss and all the wonders,
[01:37.77]I’ve got my eyes set on you,
[01:41.72]But if there’s something to be,
[01:45.18]I’ll be something,
[01:46.91]You will be something.
[01:49.69]Days of bliss and days of wonders,
[01:53.59]Those we only slept through,
[01:57.01]Still if there’s something to be,
[02:00.76]I’ll be that something,
[02:02.62]You will be something.
