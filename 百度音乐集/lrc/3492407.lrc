[00:10.14]
[00:11.24]I could pretend that I was okay
[00:15.74]I wind around the parties, drink in hand
[00:21.34]I could pretend when you went away
[00:25.91]That I had changed and I no longer hear the band
[00:31.68]
[00:31.97]But I won't lie
[00:34.01]I found a love
[00:34.62]I had to rediscover
[00:36.96]I was emotionally scarred we could not get it away
[00:45.26]There are times when it breaks and I feel amazed
[00:53.12]
[00:53.32]Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
[00:58.61]Angels in the sky will descend on our love
[01:04.43]And it's hard to deny what is happening
[01:07.85]Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
[01:10.96]We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things we know
[01:13.33]
[01:14.26]I've been a soldier for much too long
[01:18.67]I'd willingly surrender all my arms
[01:24.25]If you decided you won't be long
[01:29.08]I'd wait here patient for you
[01:32.23]Look for you every morning
[01:34.91]
[01:35.12]Had this love
[01:36.19]These were sparks
[01:37.41]We tried to push it on but
[01:39.90]I was afraid of the dark
[01:42.58]We could not get it away
[01:47.33]Never mind what they say
[01:52.05]I would feel the same
[01:55.68]
[01:55.92]Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
[02:01.12]Angels in the sky will descend on our love
[02:06.52]And it's hard to describe what is happening
[02:10.18]Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
[02:12.83]We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things you know
[02:16.15]
[02:27.03]If I could choose then my heart would be in it,
[02:30.43]My charms would be in it,
[02:32.74]My love would be in it
[02:36.25]
[02:46.71]Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
[02:52.05]Angels in the sky will descend on our love
[02:57.94]And it's hard to describe what is happening
[03:01.68]Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
[03:04.47]We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things you know
[03:07.86]
