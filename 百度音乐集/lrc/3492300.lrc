[00:23.17]Fragile seams
[00:26.14]I opened up too quick and all my dreams
[00:31.27]Were walking out I'd slowly
[00:33.33]Lost my fire
[00:36.04]With every single man a river cried
[00:40.99]
[00:41.95]I had no sensation
[00:46.85]Completely numb, left with no satisfaction
[00:51.67]I thought no-one could ever get me high again
[00:58.87]I swear, I was not looking
[01:03.11]
[01:04.09]Oh, waited so long
[01:08.98]I thought the real thing was a fake
[01:11.79]I thought it was a tool to break me down
[01:15.53]You proved me wrong again
[01:21.80]
[04:32.87][04:12.25][02:49.11][02:29.07][01:24.13]If love were liquid it would drown me
[04:35.39][04:14.66][02:52.10][02:31.46][01:27.00]In a placeless place would find me
[04:37.83][04:17.14][02:54.49][02:33.97][01:29.32]In a heart shape come around me and then
[04:40.27][04:19.90][02:57.21][02:36.75][01:32.52]Melt me slowly down
[04:42.79][04:22.02][02:59.53][02:38.83][01:34.34]If love were human it would know me
[04:45.54][04:24.85][03:02.20][02:41.60][01:37.08]In a lost space come and show me
[04:48.10][04:27.50][03:04.67][02:44.02][01:39.76]Hold me and control me and then
[04:50.83][04:30.10][03:07.71][02:46.93][01:42.52]Melt me slowly down
[04:53.36][03:51.15][01:44.70]Like chocolate
[01:48.09]Tastes so good
[01:50.96]My heart's been mended who'd have thought it would
[01:56.20]An empty bet and still I won the cash
[02:01.34]A man who I love and who
[02:03.57]Loves me back
[02:05.74]
[02:08.55]Oh, waited so long
[02:13.48]For love to heal me so I'd feel it
[02:16.31]Thought it wasn't breathing then you came
[02:20.58]You proved me wrong again
[02:27.20]
[03:09.82]Like chocolate come here
[03:14.73]Zoom in, catch the smile
[03:20.37]There's no doubt it's from you
[03:25.45]And I'm addicted to it now
[03:29.77]
[03:52.29][03:31.24]Just one look boy to melt me down
[03:54.36][03:33.56]Just one heart here to save me now
[03:56.82][03:36.09]Your candy kisses are sweet I know
[03:59.41][03:38.73]Hold me tight baby don't let go
[04:02.01][03:41.41]Just one look boy to melt me down
[04:04.50][03:43.85]Just one heart here to save me now
[04:07.14][03:46.44]Your candy kisses are sweet I know
[04:09.70][03:49.10]Hold me tight baby don't let go.
