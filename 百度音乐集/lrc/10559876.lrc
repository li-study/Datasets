[00:00] WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN

[00:18.25]When a man loves a woman
[00:24.69]Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
[00:29.74]He'd trade the world
[00:31.60]For a good thing he's found
[00:35.75]If she is bad, he can't see it
[00:41.82]She can do no wrong
[00:46.48]Turn his back on his best friend
[00:47.89]If he puts her down
[00:53.63]When a man loves a woman
[00:59.71]Spend his very last dime
[01:04.09]Trying to hold on to what he needs
[01:10.90]He'd give up all his comforts
[01:17.40]And sleep out in the rain
[01:21.88]If she said that's the way
[01:24.49]It ought to be
[01:30.89]When a man loves a woman
[01:37.11]I give you everything I got (yeah)
[01:48.34]Trying to hold on
[01:51.01]To your precious love
[01:55.66]Baby please don't treat me bad
[02:03.25]When a man loves a woman
[02:09.93]Deep down in his soul
[02:14.28]She can bring him such misery
[02:20.54]If she is playing him for a fool
[02:27.08]He's the last one to know
[02:31.88]Loving eyes can never see
[02:38.12]Yes when a man loves a woman
[02:44.39]I know exactly how he feels
[02:49.62]'Cause baby, baby, baby
[03:00.66]I am a man
