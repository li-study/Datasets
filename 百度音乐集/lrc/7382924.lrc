[00:02.54]Whistle down the wind-Tina Arena
[00:04.38]Music by Andrew Lloyd Webber
[00:07.20]
[00:10.66]Whistle down the wind
[00:16.94]Let your voices carry
[00:22.38]Drown out all the rain
[00:24.79]Light a patch of darkness
[00:27.86]Treacherous and scary
[02:10.98][00:32.44]Howl at the stars
[02:16.25][00:37.93]Whisper when you're sleepy
[02:21.06][00:42.93]I'll be there you hold you
[02:23.72][00:45.59]I'll be there to stop
[02:26.40][00:48.21]The chills and all the weeping
[02:30.73][00:52.57]Make it clear and strong
[02:35.92][00:58.03]So the whole night long
[03:12.97][02:41.25][01:34.31][01:03.08]Every signal that you send
[03:15.67][02:44.10][01:36.97][01:06.09]Until the very end
[02:46.89][01:08.78]I will not abandon you my precious friend
[02:52.54][01:13.69]So try and stand the tide
[02:57.73][01:19.31]Then you'll raise a banner
[03:02.48][01:23.88]Send a flare up in the sky
[03:05.36][01:26.94]Try to burn a torch
[03:08.11][01:29.36]And try to build a bonfire
[03:18.18][01:39.33]I'm there
[03:23.29][01:44.49]So whistle down the wind
[03:26.37][01:47.26]For I have always been
[03:31.02][01:49.80]Right there
[03:37.64][01:54.50]Oh yeah
