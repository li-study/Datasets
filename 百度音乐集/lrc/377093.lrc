[03:22.12][01:35.46][00:16.25]Time has told me
[00:24.28]You're a rare rare find
[03:32.87][00:30.20]A troubled cure
[03:38.75][00:36.28]For a troubled mind.
[03:45.91][00:43.06]And time has told me
[03:51.68][00:49.41]Not to ask for more
[00:55.89]Someday our ocean
[04:04.60][01:02.01]Will find its shore.
[01:08.34]So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
[01:15.19]What I really don't want to be
[01:21.48]Leave the ways that are making me love
[01:28.59]What I really don't want to love.
[01:41.44]You came with the dawn
[01:47.92]A soul with no footprint
[01:54.87]A rose with no thorn.
[02:00.98]Your tears they tell me
[02:07.78]There's really no way
[02:14.58]Of ending your troubles
[02:20.55]With things you can say.
[02:27.68]And time will tell you
[02:33.66]To stay by my side
[02:39.52]To keep on trying
[02:40.01]'til there's no more to hide.
[02:53.68]So leave the ways that are making you be
[02:59.18]What you really don't want to be
[03:06.56]Leave the ways that are making you love
[03:12.86]What you really don't want to love.
[03:58.31]For some day our ocean
