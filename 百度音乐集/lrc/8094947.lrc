[00:20.59]Daybreak
[00:21.45]At the bottom of lake
[00:22.61]It's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
[00:25.22]And I won't get out
[00:26.34]'til I figure it out
[00:27.69]Though I'm weak like I can't believe
[00:30.15]So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
[00:32.95]Just let me show you
[00:35.21]But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
[00:37.78]'cause I don't know if I know you
[00:39.47]
[00:50.74]Doing fine but don't waste my time
[00:52.98]Tell me what it is you want to say
[00:55.59]You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
[00:58.27]I've been out in the rain all day
[01:00.46]So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
[01:03.32]As far as I can throw you
[01:05.58]And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
[01:08.35]'cause I don't know if I know you
[01:10.09]
[01:11.60]Don't tell me you wanted me
[01:16.56]Don't tell me you thought of me
[01:21.61]I won't, I swear I won't
[01:26.69](Did)
[01:31.82]I'll try, I swear I'll try
[01:36.90](Lie)
[01:37.63]
[01:41.45]Mother Mary quite contrary
[01:43.84]Kiss the boys and make them wary
[01:46.38]Things are getting just a little bit scary
[01:48.98]It's a wonder I can still breathe
[01:51.33]
[01:51.81]Never been much of a doubting Thomas
[01:53.89]But nothing breaks like a broken promise
[01:56.37]You tell me 'bout your two more coming
[01:58.97]But once is just enough for me
[02:01.76]
[02:02.23]Don't tell me you wanted me
[02:07.16]Don't tell me you thought of me
[02:12.21]I won't, I swear I won't
[02:16.72](Did)
[02:22.37]I'll try, I swear I'll try
[02:26.98](Lie)
[02:27.40]
[02:44.74]I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
[02:48.29]She comes in apparently to fill the void
[02:52.08]All dogs need a leash and
[02:53.91]At least I'll forget it
[02:55.78]And she would never hurt me though
[02:58.62]She's never said it
[02:59.61]But I'm not gonna ask her today
[03:03.45]I don't wanna scare her away
[03:07.29]Your town, I'm all alone
[03:10.44]And I just can't stare at the phone
[03:15.00]I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
[03:18.40]And you can tell your stepfather I said so
[03:22.00]
[04:23.08]Don't tell me you wanted me
[04:27.78]Don't tell me you thought of me
[04:32.87]I won't, I swear I won't
[04:37.31](Did)
[04:43.02]I'll try, I swear I'll try
