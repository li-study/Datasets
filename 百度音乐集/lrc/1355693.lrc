[00:16.51]As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
[00:23.51]I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
[00:30.75]I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
[00:36.85]I said "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya"
[00:43.90]
[00:59.11]I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
[01:06.23]I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
