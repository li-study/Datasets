[00:48.66]New Year\'s Day
[00:48.84]Yeah...
[00:49.02]
[00:49.19]All is quiet on New Year\'s Day
[00:49.54]A world in white gets underway
[00:49.71]I want to be with you
[00:49.88]Be with you night and day
[00:50.05]Nothing changes on New Year\'s Day
[00:50.21]On New Year\'s Day
[00:50.37]
[00:50.56]I will be with you again
[00:50.73]I will be with you again
[00:50.91]
[00:51.10]Under a blood red sky
[00:51.28]hA crowd has gathered in black and white
[00:51.45]Arms entwined, the chosen few
[00:51.63]The newspapers says, says
[00:51.81]Say it\'s true it\'s true...
[00:51.98]And we can break through
[00:52.17]Though torn in two
[00:52.35]We can be one
[00:52.54]
[00:52.73]I...I will begin again
[00:52.92]I...I will begin again

[00:53.83]
[00:54.02]I will be with you again
[00:54.22]I will be with you again
[00:54.42]

[00:54.81]And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
[00:55.00]Though I want to be with you
[00:55.19]Be with you night and day
[00:55.38]Nothing changes
[00:55.57]On New Year\'s Day
[00:55.75]On New Year\'s Day
