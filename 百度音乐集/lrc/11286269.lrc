[00:07.59]The loveliness of Paris
[00:11.97]Seems someshow sadly gay
[00:17.10]The glory that was Rome
[00:20.65]Is of another day
[00:24.42]
[00:25.02]I've been terribly alone
[00:28.23]And forgotten in Manhattan
[00:31.97]I'm going home
[00:35.54]To my city by the bay
[00:41.95]
[00:44.50]I left my heart
[00:51.49]In San Francisco
[01:00.61]High on the hill
[01:06.33]It calls to me.
[01:14.11]To be where little cables cars
[01:22.77]Climb halfaway to the stars!
[01:31.15]The morning fog may chill the air.
[01:42.06]
[01:42.75]I don't care!
[01:44.50]My love waits there in San Francisco
[02:00.31]Above the blue and windy sea.
[02:13.23]When I come home to you
[02:23.68]San Francisco
[02:29.44]Your golden sun will shine for me!
[02:45.98]
