[00:01.74]Let Me Love You
[00:03.67]Tamara, Vrcak & Adrian
[00:12.94]Let’s go,
[00:13.93]Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
[00:15.74]What you going to do if I let you know
[00:17.67]You’re the only one I’ve been dreaming for
[00:20.22]I’ve never fell in love like this before
[00:22.96]Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
[00:24.82]Where the moon is full
[00:25.94]and the lights are low
[00:27.19]We can do it so slow
[00:28.12]kiss…
[00:29.42]until the dawn brakes…
[00:32.10]You always knew how to make me cry
[00:36.58]I feel so helpless without you
[00:39.81]I’m starting to lose my mind
[00:43.79]I wanna be with you tonight
[00:48.83]The stars above go
[00:51.32]like they’re making love
[00:55.05]I’m running under the moonlight
[00:57.85]alone in the sleepless nights
[01:01.77]just to be by your side
[01:06.13]Let me love you, just let me love you
[01:13.40]unfold your angel wings
[01:15.33]fly out for my wildest dreams
[01:17.32]Let me love you, just let me love you
[01:22.30]Kiss me and let me die
[01:24.35]before you tell me goodbye
[01:29.20]Let’s go,
[01:30.26]Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
[01:31.57]What you going to do if I let you know
[01:32.87]You’re the only one I’ve been dreaming for
[01:35.42]I’ve never fell in love like this before
[01:38.04]Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
[01:40.04]Where the moon is full
[01:41.04]and the lights are low
[01:42.28]We can do it so slow
[01:43.46]kiss…
[01:44.52]until the dawn brakes…
[01:46.14]You always knew how to make me cry
[01:51.80]Who needs a smile when my tears
[01:54.97]are so full of love inside
[01:58.77]And they are stronger than my pride
[02:05.36]Let me love you, just let me love you
[02:10.03]unfold your angel wings
[02:12.02]fly out for my wildest dreams
[02:14.01]Let me love you, just let me love you
[02:19.04]Kiss me and let me die
[02:21.04]before you tell me goodbye
[02:32.29]Let me love you, just let me love you
[02:37.46]Kiss me and let me die
[02:39.57]before you tell me goodbye
