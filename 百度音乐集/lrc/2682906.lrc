[00:03.80]Wish You Were Here (Live)
[00:23.11]Pink Floyd
[00:29.53]
[01:28.45]So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
[01:42.15]Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, A smile from a veil?
[01:54.38]Do you think you can tell?
[01:56.13]
[01:58.22]And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts, Hot ashes for trees?
[02:09.47]Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?
[02:16.54]And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
[02:26.55]
[03:02.21]How I wish, how I wish you were here.
[03:07.71]We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
[03:16.45]Running over the same old ground.
[03:19.94]What have you found? The same old fears.
[03:24.94]Wish you were here.
[03:27.37]
