[00:00.00]Gentle On My Mind

[00:30.69]It's knowing that your door is always open
[00:34.21]And your path is free to walk
[00:40.65]That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
[00:43.39]Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
[00:49.96]And it's knowing I'm not shackled
[00:51.96]By forgotten words and bonds
[00:54.55]And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
[01:02.00]That keeps you in the backroads
[01:04.48]By the rivers of my memry
[01:06.69]That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
[01:10.27]
[01:17.91]It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
[01:21.04]Planted on their columns now that binds me
[01:28.24]Or something that somebody said
[01:30.67]Because they thought we fit together walking
[01:37.42]It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
[01:40.81]Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
[01:49.27]That you are moving on the backroads
[01:51.67]By the rivers of my memry
[01:53.95]And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
[01:57.84]
[02:38.65]Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
[02:41.14]And the junkyards and the highways come between us
[02:48.68]And some other woman crying to her mother
[02:52.00]'Cause she turned and I was gone
[02:58.44]I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
[03:02.97]And the summer sun might burn me til I'm blind
[03:10.43]But not to where I cannot see you walking on the backroads
[03:14.85]By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
[03:18.91]
[03:26.53]I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling
[03:30.06]Crackling caldron in some train yard
[03:36.49]My beard a roughning coal pile and
[03:38.66]A dirty hat pulled low across my face
[03:45.71]Through cupped hands round a tin can
[03:47.84]I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
[03:55.12]That you're waving from the backroads
[03:57.94]By the rivers of my memry
[03:59.96]Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
[04:04.11]
