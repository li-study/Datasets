[00:00.00]With one light on in one room
[00:04.00]I know you're up when I get home
[00:09.98]With one small step upon the stair
[00:14.79]I know your look when I get there
[00:19.83]If you were a king up there on your throne
[00:24.66]would you be wise enough to let me go
[00:30.36]for this queen you think you own
[00:38.02]Wants to be a hunter again
[00:43.27]wants to see the world alone again
[00:48.02]to take a chance on life again
[00:53.07]so let me go
[00:59.59]The unread book and painful look
[01:04.16]the tv's on, the sound is down
[01:09.05]One long pause
[01:12.77]then you begin
[01:14.30]oh look what the cat's brought in
[01:19.59]If you were a king up there on your throne
[01:24.92]would you be wise enough to let me go
[01:30.09]for this queen you think you own
[01:37.48]Wants to be a hunter again
[01:42.73]wants to see the world alone again
[01:47.69]to take a chance on life again
[01:52.88]so let me go
[01:58.77]let me leave
[02:04.78]For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
[02:10.42]and I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow
[02:15.61]and all the time I'm thinking, thinking
[02:24.86]I want to be a hunter again
[02:30.19]want to see the world alone again
[02:34.33]to take a chance on life again
[02:39.69]so let me go.
[02:45.28]I want to be a hunter again
[02:51.08]want to see the world alone again
[02:55.80]to take a chance on life again
[03:00.97]so let me go.
[03:06.10]let me leave
[03:10.50]let me go
