[00:07.00]
[00:07.64]In the morning when I walk along
[00:11.46]And it's been raining all night
[00:15.31]It seems the rain is all the tears that I cried last night
[00:24.21]
[00:25.08]When I walk along through autumn leaves
[00:27.77]That must have fallen last night
[00:31.55]It seems the leaves are all the tears that I cried at night
[00:38.91]
[00:39.94]If he doesn't come back soon
[00:44.47]The streets will never be dry
[00:47.83]If he doesn't come back- the road-sweeper
[00:52.94]Will never clear away my tears
[00:55.92]
[00:56.41]And I know I just won't sleep tonight
[00:59.93]I'll watch the rain and hear the wind
[01:04.23]Blowing all my tears down to the street
[01:12.28]
[01:13.38]If he doesn't come back soon
[01:16.52]The streets will never be dry
[01:20.57]If he doesn't come back- the road-sweeper
[01:25.70]Will never clear away my tears
[01:28.80]
[01:29.22]And I know I just won't sleep tonight
[01:32.48]I'll watch the rain and hear the wind
[01:36.48]Blowing all my tears down to the street
[01:44.91]
