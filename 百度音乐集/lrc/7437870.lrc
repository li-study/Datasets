[00:11.15]Least you can say, you let somethin fly when somethin flew
[00:14.47]These niggaz get hit and call they lawyer
[00:16.42]And try to sue you, that's a bitch nigga for ya
[00:19.05]I'm tough like Mayoga, and De La Hoya, I saw ya
[00:22.61]Man niggaz'll stack nines for that Cola
[00:25.24]Cause zips in my shit, I don't grow stems

[00:30.65]Why say somethin about my name?
[00:32.64]Don't jump out the window, it's safer jumpin out a plane
[00:35.50]I can't ditch my bitch, it's somethin 'bout her brain
[00:38.19]If she put her mind to it she could suck out a vein
[00:40.77]You don't want a lead shower stay the fuck out the rain
[00:43.50]There's so much ammo niggaz don't gotta aim
[00:46:00]
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
[00:46.50]You don't get a warnin, there's no heads up when it's on
[00:49.74]Here it comes, ready or not
[00:51.59]Don't be out there snorin, one eye blink and you're gone
[00:54.92]Keep it cocked - and ready to pop
[00:56.99]The man makes no mistakes, it's been on since the day I was born
[01:00.23]Stop drop, or get lead in your knot
[01:02.36]I'm known in hip-hop, but I'm still ridin around with my chrome
[01:05.81]Here it comes - ready or not

[01:10.63]Glock-16 with the Napoleon complex
[01:12.95]I'm in and out the projects, my lifestyle pleasant
[01:15.35]You? You live life like a barbaric peasant
[01:18.88]Me without my gun in the streets is like a Muslim eatin pig feet
[01:22.69]Fuck the pigs on the street
[01:24.27]They all wanna off a nigga - and when these rappers
[01:26.79]get shot they ain't gangsta, they turn into corporate niggaz
[01:30.08]You die if it's rated R
[01:32.06]If it's PG-13 you leave with a scar
[01:34.89]R.I.P. to Troy and Bags, big shout to Hommo
[01:37.46]They got fishin money cooked, buy me the Apollo
[01:40.41]These model hoes swallow, I buy another bottle
[01:42.82]of this M.O.B. nigga, that's my motto
[01:46.49]These rappers ain't kings, they pawns
[01:49.40]And got dust bunnies on they guns
[01:50:50]
[Chorus]
[01:50.57]You don't get a warnin, there's no heads up when it's on

[Lloyd Banks]
[02:12.28]I think God spent a lil' extra time on me
[02:14.92]Pop planted a miracle seed my mom ain't see
[02:17.60]I got a high intelligence level, I ain't no dummy
[02:20.33]I ain't satisfied with 10 mil', that ain't no money
[02:23.01]My talents are blood deep, you can't take those from me
[02:25.74]And my sense of humor's shot, I don't take jokes funny
[02:28.56]My paranoia rolls with my bullet holes
[02:31.23]givin me a third eye, my foes can get a magazine full of those
[02:34.14]The hip-hop cops follow my Suburban
[02:36.69]Hopin they can find a pistol on him when they search him
[02:39.32]I'm icier in person, they like me when I'm cursin
[02:42.05]So here's a dirty version, you only heard me urban
[02:44.78]If niggaz try to hurt him, the I-30's squirtin
[02:47.46]Right through your curtain, don't stop 'til you murk him
[02:50.28]Mechanical workin, Hechler handle's jerkin
[02:52.87]That'll pull the Gate in after you Heavenly church him
[02:55:50]
[Chorus]
[02:55.91]You don't get a warnin, there's no heads up when it's on

[03:00.89]Don't be out there snorin, one eye blink and you're gone
[03:04.27]Keep it cocked - and ready to pop
[03:06.39]The man makes no mistakes, it's been on since the day I was born
[03:09.59]Stop drop, or get lead in your knot
[03:11.71]I'm known in hip-hop, but I'm still ridin around with my chrome
[03:14.90]Here it comes - ready or not
