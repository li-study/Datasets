[00:54.91]Honey you can have me
[00:56.11]When you want me
[00:58.71]If you simply ask me to be there
[01:03.59]And your the only one who
[01:05.30]Makes me come running
[01:08.50]Cause what you got is far
[01:10.39]Beyond compare
[02:32.85][01:12.96]And it's just like honey
[02:38.10][01:17.12]When your love comes over me
[02:44.27][01:24.28]Oh baby i've got a dependency
[01:28.04]Always strung out for another
[01:30.45]Taste of your honey
[02:53.58][01:33.16]It's like honey when it washes over me
[02:57.39][01:35.58]You know sugar never ever was so sweet
[02:58.40][01:37.81]And i'm dying for you cryin' for you i adore you
[03:03.55][01:42.91]One hit of your love addicted me
[03:05.85][01:45.86]Now i'm strung out on you darlin'
[03:08.01][01:47.74]Don't you see every night and day
[03:10.85][01:51.91]I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
[02:03.84][01:54.26]Honey i can't describe
[02:08.76][01:59.26]How good it feels inside
[02:14.03]I can't be elusive
[02:15.90]With you honey
[02:19.09]Because it's blatant
[02:19.62]That i'm feeling you
[02:23.15]And it's too hard for me
[02:25.50]To leave abruptly
[02:29.04]Cause your the only thing
[02:30.65]I wanna do
[02:48.21]Always strung out for another taste of honey
