[00:27.00]You are the candle, love's the flame
[00:33.00]A fire that burns through wind and rain
[00:39.00]Shine your light on this heart of mine
[00:45.00]Till the end of time
[03:37.00][00:51.00]You came to me like the dawn through the night
[03:41.00][00:56.00]Just shinin' like the sun
[03:48.00][01:03.00]Out of my dreams and into my life
[03:53.00][01:07.00]You are the one, you are the one
[04:02.00][02:41.00][01:18.00]Said I loved you but I lied
[04:08.00][02:48.00][01:24.00]'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
[04:14.00][02:53.00][01:30.00]Said I loved you but I was wrong
[04:20.00][02:59.00][01:36.00]'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
[03:05.00][01:42.00]Said I loved you but I lied
[01:51.00]With all my soul I've tried in vain
[01:57.00]How can mere words my heart explain
[02:02.00]This taste of heaven so deep so true
[02:09.00]I've found in you
[02:14.00]So many reasons in so many ways
[02:19.00]My life has just begun
[02:22.00]Need you forever, I need you to stay
[02:31.00]You are the one, you are the one
[04:26.00]Said I loved you
[04:29.00]But this is more than love I feel inside
[04:35.00]Said I loved you....But I lied
[04:51.00]
