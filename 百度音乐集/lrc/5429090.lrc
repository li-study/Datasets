[00:23.09]Well this Christmas,
[00:24.92]I am falling like snowflakes at your door
[00:30.70]As my guardian angel singing for someone else
[00:40.20]Eternity stings, when love has turned into pain
[00:47.90]Woo 'love' must be something I don't deserve
[00:57.82]This is my private Christmas Song

[01:15.96]As tonight, I am craving for those endless kisses
[01:25.75]A melody written for someone
[01:28.63]just as a child has its parents
[01:32.04]
[01:32.42]This song is something you never care for
