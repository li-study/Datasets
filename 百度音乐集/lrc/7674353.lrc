[00:08.00]
[01:36.59][00:23.07]Just let me tell you now
[00:29.47]When I had you to myself I didn't want you around
[00:34.58]Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
[00:39.17]But someone picked you from the bunch
[00:41.86]One glance was all it took
[00:44.14]Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
[00:49.58]Oh baby give me one more chance
[01:40.02][00:52.72](To show you that I love you)
[01:41.96][00:54.72]Won't you please let me back in your heart
[01:46.15][00:58.75]Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
[01:50.21][01:03.16](Let you go, baby)
[02:31.59][01:51.58][01:04.27]But now since I see you in his arms
[01:08.56](I want you back) Yes I do now
[01:10.55](I want you back) Ooh ooh baby
[01:12.62](I want you back) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:15.17](I want you back) Nah, nah, nah, nah
[01:17.82]Tryin' to live without your love is one long, sleepless night
[01:22.30]Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
[01:27.07]Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
[01:31.95]Following the girl I didn't even want around
[01:37.07]Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
[02:05.50]All I want, all I need, all I want, all I need
[02:15.30]Just one more chance
[02:17.56]Show you that I love you, baby
[02:22.58]Forget what happened then
[02:25.71]Let me live again
[02:27.55]Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
[02:36.52]Spare me of this cost
[02:39.04]Give back what I lost
[02:41.51]Oh baby I need one more chance
[02:44.08]I tell you that I love you
[02:46.19]I want you back!
