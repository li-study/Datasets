[00:00.68]Pistol Annies - Lemon Drop
[00:03.15]
[00:07.78]My muffler's tied on with a guitar string
[00:10.75]I owe 7,000 dollars to a bank machine
[00:14.23]Before this car is ever really mine
[00:20.32]And some fine day I'll drive her downtown
[00:23.73]Get a burger, fries and a royal crown
[00:26.54]Thankin' God that I'll never
[00:28.34]Have to pay another dime
[00:31.81]
[00:33.07]My life is like a lemon drop
[00:35.93]I'm suckin' on the bitter to get to the sweet part
[00:39.94]I know there are better days ahead
[00:44.64]
[00:45.72]I got dirty shirts and worn out jeans
[00:48.65]I owe two dozen quarters to a washin' machine
[00:51.98]Before these clothes will ever really shine
[00:58.14]But I got me a man, that just don't care
[01:01.27]If his little darlin's got underware
[01:04.62]I know someday I'm gonna be his wife
[01:09.93]
[01:11.02]My life is like a lemon drop
[01:13.80]I'm suckin' on the bitter to get to the sweet part
[01:17.66]I know there are better days ahead
[01:22.44]
[01:23.48]I got thrift store curtains in the windows of my home
[01:26.71]I'm payin' for a house that the landlord owns
[01:29.74]Bought a TV on a credit card
[01:33.04]It'll take me ten years to pay if off
[01:36.34]But some fine day I'll be drinkin' a beer
[01:39.24]In a big backyard I own free and clear
[01:42.59]All I know, there's better days ahead
[01:47.66]
[02:00.52]So I play my hopes and play my dreams
[02:04.44]Just like two coins in a slot machine
[02:07.45]Sing "Glory, Hallelujah" if everything works out fine
[02:13.63]
[02:14.28]My life is like a lemon drop
[02:16.97]I'm suckin' on the bitter to get to the sweet part
[02:20.75]I know there are better days ahead
[02:25.30]
[02:26.53]Lord I know there are better days ahead
[02:32.48]Thank God
