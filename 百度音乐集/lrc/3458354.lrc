[00:12.33]
[00:42.79]I don't know if you can see
[00:45.85]The changes that have come over me
[00:49.46]In these last few days I've been afraid
[00:53.21]That I might drift away
[00:58.99]I've been telling old stories, singing songs
[01:02.49]That make me think about
[01:04.76]where I've come from
[01:06.73]That's the reason why I seem
[01:09.95]So far away today
[01:13.66]
[01:15.94]Let me tell you that I love you
[01:19.19]That I think about you all the time
[01:22.87]Caledonia, you're calling me,
[01:26.56]now I'm going home
[01:30.56]But if I should become a stranger
[01:33.96]Know that it would make me more than sad
[01:38.00]Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
[01:43.26]
[01:57.30]Now I have moved
[01:58.55]and I've kept on moving
[02:00.17]Proved the points
[02:01.73]that I needed proving
[02:04.39]Lost the friends
[02:05.56]that I needed losing
[02:07.56]Found others on the way
[02:12.58]I have kissed the fellas
[02:15.11]and left them crying
[02:16.68]Stolen dreams, yes,
[02:18.86]there's no denying
[02:20.45]I have traveled hard,
[02:21.95]sometimes with conscience flying
[02:24.67]Somewhere with the wind
[02:27.63]
[02:29.71]Let me tell you that I love you
[02:32.58]That I think about you all the time
[02:36.80]Caledonia, you're calling me,
[02:40.17]now I'm going home
[02:44.11]But if I should become a stranger
[02:47.45]Know that it would make me more than sad
[02:51.52]Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
[02:56.78]
[03:10.02]Now I'm sitting here before the fire
[03:14.02]The empty room, the forest choir
[03:17.61]The flames have cooled,
[03:19.52]don't get any higher
[03:20.95]They've withered,
[03:22.89]now they've gone
[03:25.29]
[03:26.67]But I'm steady thinking,
[03:28.61]my way is clear
[03:30.14]And I know what I will do tomorrow
[03:33.98]When hands have shaken,
[03:36.03]the kisses float
[03:37.29]Then I will disappear
[03:41.28]
[03:42.97]Let me tell you that I love you
[03:45.65]That I think about you all the time
[03:49.56]Caledonia, you're calling me,
[03:53.16]now I'm going home
[03:56.91]But if I should become a stranger
[04:00.10]Know that it would make me more than sad
[04:03.57]Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
[04:08.85]
[04:18.98]Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
