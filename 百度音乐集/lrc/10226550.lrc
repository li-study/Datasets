[00:05.00]John Denver
[00:07.00]
[00:08.31]All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
[00:11.83]I'm standing here outside your door
[00:15.31]I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
[00:22.55]But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn'
[00:26.36]The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
[00:29.74]Already I'm so lonesome I could die
[00:33.00]
[00:36.50]So kiss me and smile for me
[00:41.00]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[00:44.17]Hold me like you'll never let me go
[00:50.92]'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
[00:55.66]I don't know when I'll be back again
[00:59.65]Oh baby, I hate to go
[01:04.00]
[01:09.30]There's so many times I've let you down
[01:12.84]So many times I've played around
[01:16.43]I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
[01:23.38]Every place I go I think of you
[01:27.10]Every song I sing I'll sing for you
[01:30.90]When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring
[01:37.17]
[01:38.44]So kiss me and smile for me
[01:42.39]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[01:45.81]Hold me like you'll never let me go
[01:52.60]'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
[01:57.30]I don't know when I'll be back again
[02:00.56]Oh baby, I hate to go
[02:09.00]
[02:11.23]Now the time has come to leave you
[02:14.44]One more time, oh let me kiss you
[02:18.58]And close your eyes and I'll be on my way
[02:24.76]Dream about the days to come
[02:29.20]When I won't have to leave alone
[02:32.81]About the times that I won't have to say
[02:37.00]
[02:40.24]So kiss me and smile for me
[02:44.32]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[02:47.79]Hold me like you'll never let me go
[02:54.05]'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
[02:58.81]I don't know when I'll be back again
[03:02.47]Oh baby, I hate to go
[03:08.82]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[03:13.55]I don't know when I'll be back again
