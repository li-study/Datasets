[00:03.54]Made by ＢＩＧ UNCLE
[00:10.52]Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
[00:12.01]Hand grenade pins in every line
[00:13.78]Throw \'em up and let something shine
[00:15.35]Going out of my fucking mind
[00:17.14]Filthy mouth, no excuse
[00:18.61]Find a new place to hang this noose
[00:20.36]String me up from atop these roofs
[00:22.03]Knot it tight so I won\'t get loose
[00:23.80]Truth is, you can stop and stare
[00:25.47]Run myself out and no one cares
[00:27.15]Dug the trench out, laid down there
[00:28.88]With a shovel up that\'ll reach somewhere
[00:30.59]Yeah, someone pour it in
[00:32.19]Make it a dirt dance floor again
[00:33.85]Say your prayers and stomp it out
[00:35.74]When they bring that chorus in
[00:37.00]
[00:37.26]I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
[00:40.07]I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away

[00:50.77]I bleed it out, go, stop the show
[00:52.91]Drop your words and let sloppy flow
[00:54.56]Shotgun, opera, lock and load
[00:56.27]Cock it back and then watch it go
[00:58.01]Mama, help me, I\'ve been cursed
[00:59.71]Death is rollin\' in every verse
[01:01.32]Candy paint on his brand new hearse
[01:03.00]Can\'t contain him, he knows he works
[01:04.86]Fuck, this hurts, I won\'t lie
[01:06.53]Doesn\'t matter how hard I try
[01:08.27]Half the words don\'t mean a thing
[01:09.97]And I know that I won\'t be satisfied
[01:11.62]So I try ignoring him
[01:13.30]Make it a dirt dance floor again
[01:15.06]Say your prayers and stomp it out

[01:37.40]I\'ll make you face this
[01:40.69]I\'ve pulled myself so far
