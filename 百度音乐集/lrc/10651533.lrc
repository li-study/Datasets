Sirens of the Sea
Oceanlab

Take my hand take my hand yeah take my hand
Follow me follow me yeah let's go
To the sand to the sand the purest sand

Into the sea into the sea yeah let's go

I... Cannot... Resist... Your call

Take my hand take my hand yeah take my hand
Follow me follow me yeah let's go
To the sand to the sand the purest sand
Into the sea into the sea yeah let's go

Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire set me free
Let us lie here all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea

I... Cannot... Resist... Your call
