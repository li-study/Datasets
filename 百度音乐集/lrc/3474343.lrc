[00:10.31]
[00:16.31]We're walking in the air
[00:20.39]We're floating in the moonlit sky
[00:26.97]The people far below are sleeping as we fly
[00:34.49]
[00:35.67]I'm holding very tight
[00:39.85]I'm riding in the midnight blue
[00:46.44]I'm finding I can fly so high above with you
[00:53.13]
[01:08.28]Far across the world
[01:12.38]The villages go by like trees
[01:18.89]The rivers and the hills
[01:21.19]The forests and the streams
[01:25.79]
[01:27.83]Children gaze open mouth
[01:32.10]Taken by surprise
[01:35.36]Nobody down below believes their eyes
[01:43.91]We're surfing in the air
[01:48.17]We're swimming in the frozen sky
[01:54.58]We're drifting over icy
[01:56.92]Mountains floating by
[02:01.95]
[02:18.89]Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
[02:26.26]Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep
[02:38.07]
[03:29.68]We're walking in the air
[03:33.48]We're floating in the midnight sky
[03:39.47]And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
[03:46.66]I'm holding very tight
[03:50.49]I'm riding in the midnight blue
[03:56.52]I'm finding I can fly so high above with you
[04:08.92]
