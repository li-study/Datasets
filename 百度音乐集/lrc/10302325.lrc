[00:23.39]What I thought wasn’t mine
[00:27.28]In the light
[00:29.02]Was one of a kind,
[00:32.37]A precious pearl
[00:34.53]When I wanted to cry
[00:37.92]I couldn’t cause I
[00:40.71]Wasn’t allowed
[00:43.27]Gomen nasai for everything
[00:48.80]Gomen nasai, I know I let you down
[00:54.00]Gomen nasai till the end
[00:56.86]I never needed a friend
[00:59.91]Like I do now
[01:05.61]What I thought wasn't all
[01:09.01]So innocent
[01:11.49]Was a delicate doll
[01:14.80]Of porcelain
[01:16.98]When I wanted to call you
[01:20.40]And ask you for help
[01:22.62]I stopped myself
[01:25.61]Gomen nasai for everything
[01:31.10]Gomen nasai, I know I let you down
[01:36.37]Gomen nasai till the end
[01:39.20]I never needed a friend
[01:42.27]Like I do now
[02:10.80]What I thought was a dream
[02:14.53]An mirage
[02:16.30]Was as real as it seemed
[02:19.63]A privilege
[02:21.85]When I wanted to tell you
[02:25.25]I made a mistake
[02:27.35]I walked away
[02:30.51]Gomen nasai, for everything
[02:36.00]Gomen nasai,
[02:39.18]Gomen nasai,
[02:41.91]Gomen nasai,
[02:44.19]I never needed a friend,
[02:47.47]Like I do now
[02:50.34]Gomen nasai, I let you down
[02:55.94]Gomen nasai,
[02:58.71]Gomen nasai,
[03:01.20]Gomen nasai till the end
[03:03.97]I never needed a friend
[03:10.10]Like I do now
