[00:02.26]Anything for you
[00:07.13]Gloria Estefan
[00:11.56]
[00:27.62]Anything for you
[00:31.51]Though you're not here
[00:34.39]Since you said we're through
[00:37.68]It seems like years
[00:40.55]Time keeps draggin on and on
[00:43.79]And forever's been and gone
[00:46.90]Still I can't figure what went wrong
[00:53.09]I'd still do anything for you
[00:57.48]I'll play your game
[01:00.75]You hurt me through and through
[01:04.17]But you can have your way
[01:07.20]I can pretend each time I see you
[01:10.35]That I don't care and I don't need you
[01:13.73]And though you'll never see me cryin'
[01:17.32]You know inside I feel like dying
[01:23.24]And I'd do anything for you
[01:27.36]In spite of it all
[01:30.44]I've learned so much from you
[01:33.66]You made me strong
[01:36.24]But don't you ever think that I don't love you
[01:39.98]That for one minute I forgot you
[01:43.18]But sometimes things don't work out right
[01:46.49]And you just have to say goodbye
[01:50.28]I hope you find somone to please you
[01:53.24]Somone who'll care and never leave you
[01:57.23]But if that someone ever hurts you
[02:00.22]You just might need a friend to turn to
[02:06.49]And I'd do anything for you
[02:10.72]I'll give you up
[02:13.90]If that's what I should do
[02:16.97]To make you happy
[02:19.82]I can pretend each time I see you
[02:23.20]That I don't care and I don't need you
[02:26.64]And though inside I feel like dying
[02:30.04]You know you'll never see me crying
[02:33.12]Don't you ever think that I don't love you
[02:36.56]That for one minute I forgot you
[02:40.14]But sometimes things don't work out right
[02:43.31]And you just have to say goodbye
