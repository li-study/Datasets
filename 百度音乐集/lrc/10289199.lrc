[00:20.13]My child arrived just the other day;
[00:22.75]He came to the world in the usual day,
[00:26.01]But there were planes to catch and bills to pay,
[00:29.31]He learned to walk while I was away.
[00:32.50]And he was talking before I knew it,
[00:34.17]And as he grew he'd say:
[00:36.10]"I'm going to be like you,dad,
[00:39.25]You know I'm going to be like you."
[00:43.87]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[00:47.24]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[00:50.39]"When you coming home,dad?"
[00:52.39]"I don't know when,
[00:53.42]But we'll get together then,
[00:56.51]You know we'll have a good time then."
[00:59.15]
[01:08.54]My son turned ten just the other day.
[01:11.32]He said,"Thanks for the ball,dad,come on,let's play.
[01:14.54]Can you teach me to throw?"
[01:15.81]I said,"Not today,I've got a lot to do."
[01:18.84]He said,"That's OK."
[01:20.62]And he walked away,but his smile never dimmed;
[01:23.25]He said I'm going to be like him,yeah.
[01:26.87]You know I'm going to be like him.
[01:31.41]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[01:34.58]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[01:37.63]"When you coming home,dad?"
[01:39.10]"I don't know when,
[01:40.46]But we'll get together then,
[01:43.41]You know we'll have a good time then."
[01:46.08]
[02:13.14]Well,he came from college just the other day,
[02:16.02]So much like a man,I just had to say,
[02:19.52]"Son,I'm proud of you,can you sit for a while?"
[02:22.93]He shook his head and said with a smile,
[02:26.32]"What I'd really like,Dad,is to borrow the car keys.
[02:30.35]See you later,can I have them please?"
[02:34.83]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[02:38.24]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[02:41.70]"When you coming home,son?"
[02:43.66]"I don't know when,
[02:45.04]But we'll get together then,son
[02:48.32]You know we'll have a good time then."
[02:51.76]
[03:13.18]I've long since retired,my son's moved away
[03:16.87]I called him up just the other day.
[03:21.08]I said,"I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
[03:24.88]He said,"I'd love to,Dad,if I can fine the time.
[03:30.00]You see,my new job's a worry and the kids have the flu,
[03:33.61]But it's sure nice talking to you,dad.
[03:36.94]It's sure been nice talking to you."
[03:41.69]And as I hung up the phone,it occurred to me,
[03:45.31]He'd grown up just like me
[03:48.62]My boy was just like me.
[03:53.27]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[03:56.48]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[04:00.36]"When you coming home,son?"
[04:03.80]"I don't know when,
[04:04.88]But we'll get together then,
[04:07.05]You know we'll have a good time then."
