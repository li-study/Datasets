[00:14.83]You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
[00:26.70]You're nobody 'til somebody cares.
[00:38.67]Why you may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold,
[00:51.53]But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old.
[01:02.92]Why the world still is the same, you never change it,
[01:16.55]As sure as the stars shine above;
[01:28.92]You're nobody 'til somebody loves you,
[01:41.43]So find yourself somebody to love.
