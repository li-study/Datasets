[00:15.54]Every little kiss I tend to hold
[00:20.86]Precious in my heart you've turned to gold
[00:24.71]Love's not the word to explain
[00:29.21]Just how I feel
[00:31.51]It seemed like a dream but I'm wide-awake
[00:35.96]And like the earth inside it made me shake
[00:39.28]Like a summer fairytale, but it was real
[00:46.11]You set off a brand new kind of spark inside of me
[00:53.55]And I wouldn't leave your lips even to breathe
[00:59.64]
[01:00.39]Chorus:
[01:01.21]The first time I saw you, you were lighting up the sky
[01:08.10]Like bright flashing fireworks on the 4th of July
[01:15.90]I won't forget and I don't regret
[01:20.61]Losing my myself deep inside of your eyes
[01:27.30]That night I'll remember for the rest of my life
[01:35.88]
[01:38.21]I cherish all the moments that we spent
[01:42.07]I only wish it never had to end
[01:45.99]I can take a journey in my mind to yesterday
[01:52.96]I'll use the moon and stars to guide me there
[01:57.26]A place so far away but yet so near
[02:01.36]Just to hold you one more time, I'd be ok
[02:07.58]You set off a brand new kind of spark inside of me
[02:14.25]And I wouldn't leave your lips even to breathe
[02:21.45]
[02:22.04]Chorus:
[02:22.41]The first time I saw you, you were lighting up the sky
[02:29.17]Like bright flashing fireworks on the 4th of July
[02:37.16]I won't forget and I don't regret
[02:41.68]Losing my myself deep inside of your eyes
[02:47.91]That night I'll remember for the rest of my life
[02:55.42]
[02:57.94]I feel I left my world, my life, my breath behind
[03:03.79]But I know the sun will shine through
[03:10.69]Cause I know that again I'll see you
[03:16.16]This can't be goodbye
[03:19.93]We'll meet again on the 4th of July
[03:21.34]
[03:28.03]Chorus:
[03:28.47]The first time I saw you, you were lighting up the sky
[03:34.80]Like bright flashing fireworks on the 4th of July
[03:42.55]I won't forget and I don't regret
[03:46.86]Losing my myself deep inside of your eyes
[03:57.33]That night I'll remember for the rest of my life
