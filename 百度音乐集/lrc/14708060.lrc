[00:00.00]Sinead O'Connor - I Am Stretched On Your Grave
[00:06.00]
[00:11.79]I am stretched on your grave
[03:34.62][00:16.72]And will lie there forever
[03:39.88][00:21.28]If your hands were in mine
[03:44.76][00:26.69]I'd be sure we'd not sever
[03:52.49][00:34.05]My apple tree my brightness
[03:58.78][00:40.45]It's time we were together
[04:07.65][00:49.68]For I smell of the earth
[04:12.60][00:54.66]And am worn by the weather
[01:01.91]
[01:04.87]When my family thinks
[01:09.65]That I'm safe in my bed
[01:15.45]From night until morning
[01:19.77]I am stretched at your head
[01:27.49]Calling out to the air
[01:33.94]With tears hot and wild
[01:37.33]My grief for the girl
[01:42.88]That I loved as a child
[01:49.98]
[01:54.12]Do you remember
[01:59.18]The night we were lost
[02:03.75]In the shade of the blackthorn
[02:08.63]And the chill of the frost
[02:16.20]Thanks be to Jesus
[02:22.05]We did what was right
[02:26.11]And your maiden head still
[02:31.01]Is your pillar of light
[02:39.39]
[02:42.07]The priests and the friars
[02:47.39]Approach me in dread
[02:52.05]Because I still love you
[02:57.16]My love and you're dead
[03:04.36]I still would be your shelter
[03:10.39]Through rain and through storm
[03:14.15]And with you in your cold grave
[03:19.83]I cannot sleep warm
[03:26.02]
[03:29.80]So I'm stretched on your grave
[04:19.21]
