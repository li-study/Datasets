[00:06.95]U2
[00:13.04]
[00:20.44]She's a rainbow and she loves the peaceful life
[00:25.05]Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
[00:30.13]There's a part of me in chaos that's quiet
[00:34.27]And there's a part of you that wants me to riot
[00:38.49]
[00:39.14]Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit
[00:44.04]Every sweet-tooth needs just a little hit
[00:48.73]Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot
[00:52.93]How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?
[00:57.24]
[00:58.90]Change of heart comes slow...
[01:03.80]
[01:05.96]It's not a hill, it's a mountain
[01:10.38]As you start out the climb
[01:15.16]Do you believe me or are you doubting?
[01:20.27]We're gonna make it all the way to the light
[01:24.67]But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
[01:31.20]
[01:39.69]Every generation gets a chance to change the world
[01:44.12]??Divination?? that will listen to your boys and girls
[01:48.77]Is the sweetest melody the one we haven't heard?
[01:53.56]Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?
[01:58.16]The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear
[02:02.63]
[02:04.26]But change of heart comes slow...
[02:08.81]
[02:11.09]It's not a hill, it's a mountain
[02:15.65]As you start out the climb
[02:20.39]You see for me I've been shouting
[02:25.70]But we're gonna make it all the way to the light
[02:29.76]But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
[02:36.10]
[02:44.65]Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone
[02:53.98]Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone
[03:00.69]
[03:01.80]Ha, ha, ha
[03:03.38]
[03:18.54]It's not a hill, it's a mountain
[03:22.92]You see for me I've been shouting
[03:27.95]You see for me I've been shouting
[03:33.14]Let's shout until the darkness, squeeze out sparks of light
[03:37.30]You know we'll go crazy
[03:40.01]You know we'll go crazy
[03:42.28]You know we'll go crazy, if we don't go crazy tonight
[03:49.42]
