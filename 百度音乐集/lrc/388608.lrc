[00:17.05]Now the king told the boogie men
[00:20.76]You have to let that raga drop
[00:24.86]The oil down the desert way
[00:28.21]Has been shakin\' to the top
[00:32.33]The shiek he drove his Cadillac
[00:35.66]He went a\' cruisnin\' down the ville
[00:39.71]The muezzin was a\' standing
[00:43.12]On the radiator grille
[00:47.27]The shareef don\'t like it
[00:51.18]Rockin\' the Casbah
[00:53.00]Rock the Casbah

[01:02.03]By order of the prophet

[01:09.62]Degenerate the faithful
[01:12.82]With that craazy Casbah sound
[01:17.05]But the Bedouin they brought out
[01:18.86]The electric camel drum
[01:20.74]The local guitar picker
[01:22.34]Got his guitar picking thumb
[01:24.61]As soon as the shareef

[01:46.78]Now over at the temple

[01:54.15]The in crowd say it\'s cool
[01:57.52]To dig this chanting thing

[02:04.92]The temple band took five
[02:09.04]The crowd caught a wiff
[02:12.63]Of that crazy Casbah jive
[02:31.18]The king called up his jet fighters
[02:34.54]He said you better eaarn your pay
[02:38.51]Drop your bombs between the minarets
[02:41.88]Down the Casbah way
[02:46.20]As soon as the shareef was
[02:48.27]Chauffeured outta there
[02:49.91]The jet pilots tuned to
[02:51.87]The cockpit radio blare
[02:53.78]As soon as the shareef was
[02:55.68]Outta their hair
[02:57.45]The jet pilots wailed
[03:17.98]He thinks it\'s not kosher
[03:24.90]Fundamentally he can\'t take it.
[03:32.70]You know he really hates it.
