[00:00.00]Vanessa Carlton - Twilight
[00:09.77]
[00:11.77]I was stained with a role in a day not my own
[00:16.81]But as you walked into my life
[00:19.31]you showed what needed to be shown
[00:22.05]And I always knew what was right,
[00:24.77]I just didn't know that I might
[00:27.31]Peel away and choose to see
[00:29.73]with such a different sight
[00:32.28]
[03:13.68][02:17.64][01:30.24][00:33.88]And I will never see the sky the same way
[03:18.98][02:22.71][01:35.52][00:38.44]And I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday
[03:23.52][02:27.00][01:39.86][00:43.44]And I will never cease to fly if held down
[03:28.52][02:32.18][01:45.15][00:48.80]And I will always reach too high
[03:32.49][02:36.19][01:49.23][00:52.65]'Cause I've seen, 'cause I've seen
[03:37.65][02:39.90][00:56.23]Twilight
[03:43.33][02:44.67][01:53.51][01:00.95]
[01:07.85]Never cared, never wanted,
[01:10.54]never sought to see what flaunted
[01:13.25]So on purpose, so in my face,
[01:15.80]couldn't see beyond my own place
[01:18.57]And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold
[01:22.40]But you taught me I could change
[01:24.81]whatever came within these shallow days
[01:29.13]
[01:53.97]As the sun shines through it
[01:56.53]pushes away and pushes ahead
[01:59.04]It fills the warmth of blue
[02:01.75]and leaves a chill instead
[02:04.12]And I didn't know that
[02:05.64]I could be so blind to all that is so real
[02:09.70]But as illusion dies
[02:11.33]I see there is so much to be revealed
[02:51.63]I was stained by a role in a day not my own
[02:56.66]But as you walked into my life
[02:59.29]you showed what needed to be shown
[03:01.90]I always knew what was right,
[03:04.62]just didn't know that I might
[03:07.19]Peel away and choose to see
[03:09.61]with such a different sight
[04:11.42][03:12.30]
