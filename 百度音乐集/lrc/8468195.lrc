[00:14.77]So many wasted days
[00:19.47]Come and go like ocean waves
[00:24.18]It hits me like a freight train
[00:29.30]And now I can't get off my face
[00:32.28]
[00:34.29]How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
[00:39.36]Who am I to spread my fingers after God has filled my hands
[00:44.39]Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
[00:53.40]
[01:04.02]Respect her ignorance
[01:08.59]Just in case she takes offense
[01:13.80]The darkness that's killing her
[01:18.41]Well that is just not my concern
[01:23.13]
[01:23.23]How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
[01:28.26]Who am I to spread my fingers
[01:32.82]after God has filled my hands
[01:35.55]Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
[01:41.88]
[01:42.91]You're not guaranteed tomorrow
[01:52.45]You're not guaranteed tomorrow
[02:02.05]
[02:02.51]How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
[02:07.83]Who am I to spread my fingers
[02:12.16]after God has filled my hands
[02:15.00]Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
