[00:00.00]Ronan Keating & Leann Rimes - Last Thing On My Mind
[00:05.65]Four o'clock in the morning
[00:10.12]My mind's filled with a thousand thoughts of you
[00:15.13]And how you left without a warning
[00:19.75]But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through
[00:24.81]Now I see it clearly
[00:29.45]We're together but living separate lives
[00:34.02]So wanna tell you I'm sorry
[00:39.00]Baby I can't find the words
[00:42.50]But if I could,then you know I would,yeah...
[00:56.72][01:58.85][02:42.00]No I won't let you go,know what we can be
[01:01.51][02:03.55][02:46.63][03:10.53]I won't watch my life,crashing down on me
[01:06.27][02:08.32][02:51.32][03:15.19]Guess I had it all,right there before my eyes,yeah...
[01:15.85][02:17.93][02:59.94][03:24.82]Girl,I'm sorry now,you were the last thing on my mind
[01:26.62]You carried me like a river
[01:31.35]How far we've come still surprises me
[01:36.15]And now I look in the mirror
[01:41.09]Staring back is the man I used to
[01:45.50]be with you
[01:49.28]How I long for you
[02:27.69]Girl I'm sorry I was wrong
[02:32.22]Could have been there
[02:35.15]Should have been so strong
[02:37.15]So I'm sorry,wooh
