[00:23.78]I see a shadow every day and night.
[00:28.25]I walk a hundred streets of neon lights,
[00:31.53]Only when I'm crying.
[00:35.63]Can you hear me crying.
[00:38.68]
[00:41.64]So many times you always wanted more,
[00:46.28]Chasing illusions that you're longing for.
[00:49.54]Wish I wasn't crying.
[00:53.64]Can you hear me crying.
[00:56.67]
[00:58.22]There's an ocean between us.
[01:03.44]You know where to find me.
[01:07.99]You reach out and touch me.
[01:12.43]I feel you in my own heart.
[01:17.41]More than a lifetime.
[01:21.31]Still goes on forever.
[01:25.91]But it helps to remember
[01:30.33]You're only an ocean away.
[01:38.66]
[01:44.87]Was there a moment when I felt no pain.
[01:49.38]I want to feel it in my life again.
[01:52.50]Let it be over now.
[01:56.76]Oh Oh over now.
[02:00.47]
[02:02.82]'Cause I remember all the days and nights
[02:07.44]We used to walk the streets of neon lights
[02:10.64]Oh I want you here with me.
[02:14.69]Oh be here with me.
[02:18.39]
[02:19.61]There's an ocean between us.
[02:24.60]You know where to find me.
[02:29.16]You reach out and touch me.
[02:33.47]I feel you in my own heart.
[02:38.71]More than a lifetime
[02:42.62]Still goes on forever.
[02:47.09]But it helps to remember
[02:51.46]You're only an ocean away.
[02:59.63]
[03:32.88]So many times you always wanted more,
[03:37.66]Chasing illusions that you're longing for.
[03:40.78]Wish I wasn't crying.
[03:45.10]Can you hear me crying.
[03:47.94]
[03:49.73]There's an ocean between us.
[03:54.74]You know where to find me.
[03:59.09]Just reach out and touch me.
[04:03.72]I feel you in my own heart.
[04:08.84]More than a lifetime
[04:12.77]It seems like forever.
[04:17.21]But I'll always remember
[04:21.93]You're only an ocean away.
[04:30.06]
[04:35.95]Only an ocean away.
