[00:54.68]Crawling in my skin
[00:59.59]Crawling in my ski
[01:00.21]Without a sence of confidence
[01:04.90]Consuming, confusing
[01:13.21]Crawling in my skin
[01:17.89]Without a sence of confidence
[01:21.35]I\'m convinced that there\'s just too much pressure to take
[01:23.43]There\'s something inside me
[01:24.61]That pulls beneath the surface
[01:54.57]Crawling in my skin
[01:56.14]Crawling in my skin
[01:57.12]These wounds, they will not heal

[02:24.00]Consuming, confusing
[02:26.45]This lack of self-control
[02:31.21]I fear is never ending
[02:38.49]Controlling, I can\'t seem
[02:38.13]To find myself again
[02:40.76]My walls are closing in
[02:42.57]Without a sence of confidence
[02:44.03]I\'m convinced that there\'s just too much pressure to take
[02:47.14]I\'ve felt this way before
[02:49.82]So insecure

[03:13.83]Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
[03:18.91]Distracting, reacting
[03:23.18]Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
[03:27.86]It\'s haunting
[03:30.42]How I can\'t seem
[03:33.09]To find myself again
[03:35.46]My walls are closing in
