[00:05.98]Nat King Cole - Too Young
[00:18.78]They try to tell us were too young
[00:28.58]Too young to really be in love
[00:37.69]They say that loveâ€™s a word
[00:43.39]A word weve only heard
[00:47.82]But cant begin to know the meaning of
[00:56.27]And yet were not too young to know
[01:05.99]This love will last though years may go
[01:15.39]And then some day they may recall
[01:25.53]We were not too young at all
[01:42.46]

[02:18.54]And yet were not too young to know
[02:28.84]This love will last though years may go
[02:38.41]And then some day they may recall
[02:49.12]We were not too young at all
