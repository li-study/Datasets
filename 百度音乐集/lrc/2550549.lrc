[00:16.68]Lately I've been trying
[00:21.98]To fill up my days since you're gone.
[00:28.86]The speed of love is blinding,
[00:35.31]And I didn't know how to hold on.
[00:40.93]My mind won't clear.
[00:44.04]I'm out of tears.
[00:47.25]My heart's got no room left inside.
[00:51.99]
[00:54.67]How many dreams will end?
[01:01.02]How long can I pretend?
[01:07.59]How many times will love pass me by,
[01:13.96]Until I find you again?
[01:24.66]Will the arms of hope surround me?
[01:30.50]Will time be a fairweather friend?
[01:37.52]Should I call out to angels,
[01:43.09]Or just drink myself sober again?
[01:49.10]I can't hide, it's true.
[01:52.31]I still burn for you.
[01:55.54]Your memory just won't let me go.
[01:59.74]
[02:02.78]How many dreams will end?
[02:09.31]How long can I pretend?
[02:15.79]How many times will love pass me by,
[02:22.07]Until I find you again?
[02:25.72]
[02:29.31]I'd hold you tighter,
[02:33.97]Closer than ever before.
[02:37.98]Yeah.
[02:41.91]No flame would burn brighter,
[02:46.68]If I could touch you once more,
[02:50.87]Hold you once more!
[02:58.80]
[03:27.63]How many dreams will end?
[03:34.09]How long can I pretend?
[03:40.34]How many times will love pass me by,
[03:46.69]until I find you again?
[03:53.10]'till I find you again..
