[00:01.74]丹尼男孩
[00:08.19]
[00:10.09]Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
[00:19.37]From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
[00:29.51]The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
[00:39.01]'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
[00:50.17]But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
[01:01.14]Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
[01:11.07]'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
[01:21.07]Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
[01:32.14]
[01:32.97]And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
[01:42.46]And I am dead, as dead I well may be
[01:52.42]You'll come and find the place where I am lying
[02:00.17]And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
[02:02.93]
[02:04.20]And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
[02:24.47]And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
[02:34.85]And If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
[02:50.47]And I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
[03:04.61]
