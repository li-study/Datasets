[00:40.77]But we were fortunate to care enough
[00:46.74]We knew just where we stood

[00:53.96]You turned away
[00:57.54]And you were so unsure and so afraid
[01:03.72]Of feeling what I was feeling
[01:07.59]You were scared that love
[01:10.97]Would blow your heart away
[01:16.73]And you were certain that
[01:20.37]In time my love would stray
