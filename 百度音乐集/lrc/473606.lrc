[00:00.79]Leaving Is The Only Way Out
[00:02.38]
[00:09.50]I'm Not Sayin' I Have All The Answers
[00:18.14]And I Don't Care Who's Right Or Wrong
[00:26.26]I'm Tryin' To Pick Up The Pieces Already Fallen
[00:35.36]And Put Them Back Where They Belong
[00:43.89]So Slow Down Your Horses
[00:51.55]Stop Draggin' Me Around
[01:00.14]And If Cryin' Is The Only Way Into Your Heart
[01:08.35]Then Leavin' Is The Only Way Out
[01:25.95]We've Slammed Every Door In Anger
[01:34.41]And We've Opened Wounds We Can't Mend
[01:43.15]And One Night Lonely Is One Night Too Many
[01:52.11]Don't Wanna Wake Up To One More Night That Won't End
[02:00.87]So Slow Down Your Horses
[02:09.68]Stop Draggin' Me Around
[02:18.35]And If Cryin' Is The Only Way Into Your Heart
[02:26.60]Then Leavin' Is The Only Way Out
[02:35.27]When Late Nights And Long Lies Came Knockin'
[02:44.15]You Just Invited Them In
[02:52.64]And Our Voices Got Too Loud For Talkin'
[03:01.15]Then My Heart Hit The Floor
[03:03.72]But Your Feet Just Kept Walkin'
[03:11.26]And If Cryin' Is The Only Way You Hear Me Hurtin'
[03:20.01]For The Lovin' That I Can't Live Without
[03:28.44]And If Lovin' Ain't The Only Way Into Your Heart
[03:36.78]Then Leavin' Is The Only Way Out
[03:44.31]Oh Leavin' Is The Only Way Out
