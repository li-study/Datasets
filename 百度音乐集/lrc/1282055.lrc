[00:00.70]Taylor Swift
[00:01.00]
[00:01.29]I don't know what I want
[00:03.89]so don't ask me
[00:05.98]Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
[00:09.28]Don't know what's down this road
[00:12.27]I'm just walking
[00:14.26]Trying to see through the rain coming down
[00:18.57]Even though I'm not the only one
[00:22.85]Who feels the way I do
[00:26.94]I'm alone, on my own
[00:31.13]and that's all I know
[00:35.12]I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
[00:39.41]oh but life goes on
[00:43.10]I'm just a girl
[00:46.29]trying to find a place in
[00:48.27]This world
[00:50.33]
[00:55.36]Got the radio on
[00:58.25]my old blue jeans
[01:00.24]And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
[01:03.63]Feeling lucky today
[01:06.63]got the sunshine
[01:08.62]Could you tell me what more do I need
[01:12.81]And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
[01:18.52]But that's ok
[01:21.17]I'm alone, on my own
[01:25.36]and that's all I know
[01:29.55]I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
[01:33.64]oh but life goes on
[01:37.32]I'm just a girl
[01:40.62]trying to find a place in
[01:43.07]This world
[01:44.42]
[01:51.79]Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
[01:55.79]But I'm ready to fly
[02:00.87]I'm alone, on my own
[02:04.97]and that's all I know
[02:08.65]I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
[02:13.24]oh but life goes on
[02:25.91]I'm just a girl
[02:28.60]trying to find a place in
[02:30.60]This world
[02:38.16]I'm just a girl
[02:46.38]I'm just a girl
[02:54.90]I'm just a girl
[03:01.68]
