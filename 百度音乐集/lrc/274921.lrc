[00:05.98]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
[00:12.11]Take a sad song and make it better.
[00:19.41]Remember to let her into your heart,
[00:24.00]Then you can start to make it better.
[00:31.67]Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
[00:37.93]You were made to go out and get her.
[00:45.22]The minute you let her under your skin,
[00:50.19]Then you begin to make it better.
[00:56.37]
[00:59.20]And anytime you feel the pain,
[01:02.69]hey Jude, refrain,
[01:05.56]Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
[01:15.30]For well you know
[01:16.92]that it's a fool who plays it cool
[01:21.80]By making his world a little colder.
[01:29.73]
[01:38.82]Hey Jude, don't let me down.
[01:44.89]You have found her, now go and get her.
[01:50.86]Remember to let her into your heart,
[01:57.36]Then you can start to make it better.
[02:05.49]So let it out and let it in,
[02:09.31]hey Jude, begin,
[02:12.61]You're waiting for someone to perform with.
[02:22.20]And don't you know
[02:23.35]that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
[02:28.37]The movement you need is on your shoulder.
[02:44.74]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
[02:52.08]Take a sad song and make it better.
[02:58.16]Remember to let her under your skin,
[03:03.66]Then you'll begin to make it
[03:07.59]Better better better better better better, oh.
[03:16.16]Da da da da da da, da da da, hey Jude...
