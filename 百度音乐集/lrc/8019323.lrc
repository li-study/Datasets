[00:00.00]702 - You'll Just Never Know
[00:00.59]
[00:01.00]The song is written to Judy,a pure and wilful girl.
[00:04.10]
[00:04.59]I bet you never imagined,
[00:08.03]That one day you'd look around,
[00:11.82]And I just wouldn't be there.
[00:18.28]So I hear you're leaving,
[00:21.51]Please, don't go.
[00:24.50]I wanna make it right,
[00:27.51]'Cuz tomorrow is not promised,
[00:32.27]You never know what tomorrow holds.
[00:34.50]You just never know,
[00:39.01]Don't put it off till tomorrow today,
[00:45.19]Make it last always.
[00:51.52]
[00:52.89]My pride, my destiny,
[00:56.37]I find a peace of mind when you're next at me.
[01:00.47]You changed my darkest hour with the gleam from your eye,
[01:04.82]Simply smiling at me makes my life complete,
[01:09.14]So what's the use in fussing, fighting,
[01:13.83]When if you ever leave me I would be so weak,
[01:17.82]Oh baby please understand when I go to sleep at night,
[01:22.64]I wanna know that everything is alright.
[01:26.15]
[01:27.21]You just never know,
[01:31.53]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[01:37.28]Make it last forever,
[01:40.15]Forever and always.
[01:44.66]You just never know,
[01:48.92]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[01:54.83]Make it last forever and ever,
[01:58.30]Forever, forever and always.
[02:02.54]And I'm making sure that every time you're around me,
[02:06.61]We are creating sweet brand-new memories.
[02:10.82]Can't let these silly changes aggravate the love in me,
[02:15.26]Just for a moment you can concentrate on me.
[02:18.69]Through slow dancing in parking lots,
[02:22.95]Through hugs and kisses in the restaurant.
[02:27.51]Oh baby you can't let the sun go down before you let me know,
[02:32.82]You're loving me,
[02:35.03]'Cuz you never know.
[02:36.84]You just never know,
[02:41.31]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[02:47.07]Make it last forever,
[02:49.85]Forever and always.
[02:54.43]You just never know,
[02:58.75]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[03:04.51]Make it last forever and ever,
[03:08.26]Forever, forever and always.
[03:12.68]I can't imagine one day without you,
[03:15.94]Don't ever let it cross you mind whatever you do.
[03:20.65]Nothing else really matters to me,
[03:23.89]I'm gonna keep loving you every minute.
[03:28.45]
[03:46.71]You just never know,
[03:50.87]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[03:56.72]Make it last forever,
[03:59.24]Forever and always.
[04:04.17]You just never know,
[04:08.36]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[04:14.22]Make it last forever and ever,
[04:19.38]Forever, forever and always.
[04:22.07]You just never know,
[04:25.85]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[04:31.80]Make it last forever,
[04:35.15]Forever and always.
[04:38.94]You just never know,
[04:43.37]Don't put it off 'til tomorrow today,
[04:49.34]Make it last forever and ever,
[04:53.64]Forever, forever and always.
