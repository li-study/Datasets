[00:15.00]Richard Marx - Falling
[00:33.77]
[00:52.37]I've got a secret
[00:58.11]That I think I'm ready to share
[01:04.05]It may bring us closer
[01:09.98]It may be a burden to bear
[01:15.97]It's precious and it's real
[01:21.97]And all that I can feel
[01:24.30]
[01:24.91]Is that I'm falling
[01:32.33]As deep as any ocean
[01:35.66]In ways that can't be spoken
[01:38.33]I am falling
[01:44.33]For the millionth and the first time
[01:47.89]Ever and eternally for you
[01:53.34]
[02:04.50]You are a beacon
[02:10.32]Revealing the places I hide
[02:16.22]You've given freedom
[02:22.20]To so much that I kept inside
[02:28.02]And with one look in my eyes
[02:34.03]It can't be a surprise
[02:37.00]
[02:37.25]That I am falling
[02:44.45]As deep as any ocean
[02:47.51]In ways that can't be spoken
[02:50.12]I am falling
[02:55.97]For the millionth and the first time
[02:59.72]Ever and eternally for you
[03:05.80]
[03:31.11]Now there's no darkness
[03:37.18]My truth laid open and bare
[03:42.95]It's in my flesh and bones
[03:48.78]Yeah it's everywhere
[03:51.00]
[03:51.72]That I am falling
[03:59.06]As deep as any ocean
[04:02.06]In ways that can't be spoken
[04:04.71]I am falling
[04:10.70]Like rays that come from heaven
[04:14.65]Bathed in your reflection
[04:16.90]I am falling
[04:22.63]For the millionth and the first time
[04:26.31]Ever and eternally for you
