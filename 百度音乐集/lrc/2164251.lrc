[00:37.94]It's another tequila sunrise
[00:42.66]Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye
[00:56.42]He was just a hired hand
[01:01.03]Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
[01:07.61]The days go by
[01:13.85]Ev'ry night when the sun goes down
[01:18.71]Just another lonely boy in town
[01:24.15]And she's out runnin' 'round
[01:31.97]She wasn't just another woman
[01:36.80]And I couldn't keep from comin' on
[01:43.27]It's been so long
[01:49.97]Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when
[01:54.98]It comes down to dealin' friends
[02:01.58]It never ends
[02:26.20]Take another shot of courage
[02:30.61]Wonder why the right words never come
[02:37.24]You just get numb
[02:43.91]It's another tequila sunrise,this old world
[02:50.26]still looks the same,
[02:55.42]Another frame, mm...
