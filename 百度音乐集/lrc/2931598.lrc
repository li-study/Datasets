[00:16.42]When I look in your eyes
[00:18.46]I see a whole different sky
[00:21.10]Like I've never seen before
[00:24.90]And when I hear your voice
[00:27.07]It's like a song that I can
[00:29.07]Listen to o', over again
[01:22.73][00:33.08]It's so crazy how you make me go crazy
[01:26.72][00:37.29]Every time that I'm near you
[01:30.43][00:40.86]Cause you're just a dream

[02:41.70][02:25.15][01:41.71][00:52.02]All I wanna do is be with you be with you

[03:02.14][01:48.45][01:01.99]Just a dream
[01:06.05]When I picture the world
[01:08.30]It takes me to the sun
[01:10.70]I think about the way you smile
[01:14.37]And the words that you say
[01:16.76]Always seem to change
[01:19.15]The world that I've been living in
[01:52.95]Just a dream yeah
