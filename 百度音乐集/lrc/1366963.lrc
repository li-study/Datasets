[00:04.42]One two three four
[00:07.72]
[00:33.34]Ooh ooh
[00:37.67]
[00:46.03]While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
[00:53.32]While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
[00:58.57]While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
[01:05.40]Till the mountains crumble into the plain
[01:09.93]
[01:10.91]Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
[01:16.04]Tread that fine line
[01:23.79]Oh, we'll keep on trying
[01:29.15]Yeah
[01:30.46]Just passing our time
[01:33.39]
[01:41.01]Ooh ooh
[01:45.05]
[01:49.84]While we live according to race, colour or creed
[01:56.15]While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
[02:01.66]Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
[02:08.64]Through the eons and on and on
[02:13.84]
[02:14.34]Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
[02:20.15]We'll tread that fine line
[02:27.11]Oh oh we'll keep on trying
[02:32.90]Till the end of time
[02:36.76]Till the end of time
[02:40.47]
[02:52.81]Through the sorrow all through our splendour
[02:57.90]Don't take offence at my innuendo
[03:02.85]
[03:04.41]Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
[03:17.35]Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
[03:53.13]You can be anything you want to be
[03:57.29]Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
[04:02.54]Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
[04:07.20]Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself
[04:15.65]
[04:50.30]Ooh ooh, yeah
[04:57.27]
[05:03.78]If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
[05:09.45]If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
[05:15.04]Ha, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
[05:21.93]Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
[05:28.12]Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
[05:35.55]Hey, tread that fine line
[05:39.04](yeah) yeah
[05:43.41]We'll keep on smiling, yeah
[05:48.75](yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
[05:51.16]And whatever will be - will be
[05:56.33]We'll just keep on trying
[05:59.10]We'll just keep on trying
[06:02.00]Till the end of time
[06:04.31]Till the end of time
[06:07.76]Till the end of time
