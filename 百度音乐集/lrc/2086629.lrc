[00:25.90]The rain has stopped
[00:29.07]The sun is high
[00:31.00]There is a rainbow in the sky
[00:35.13]And a sudden breeze
[00:38.00]goes though the pines
[00:39.97]You'll hear them whisper if you try
[00:44.80]The busy days will be over
[00:49.40]Quiet night will fall
[00:53.95]Then we have whiskey and lime
[00:57.81]That's what we do in summer time
[01:01.48]
[01:11.32]tears and smiles
[01:13.76]Good days and bad
[01:15.63]Sit back and we watch how they fly
[01:20.55]The busy days will be over
[01:25.19]Quiet night will fall
[01:29.66]Then we have whiskey and lime
[01:33.51]That's what we do in summer time
[01:37.38]
[01:56.18]Destination of our journeys
[02:00.88]Isn't really far
[02:05.28]So take your time what's the rush
[02:09.15]Spare a little moment for the stars
[02:13.28]
[02:49.80]When busy days will be over
[02:54.44]and the quiet night will fall
[02:59.05]take your time what's the rush
[03:02.78]Spare a little moment for the stars
[03:08.06]Then we have whiskey and lime
[03:11.92]That's what we do in summer time
[03:15.66]
