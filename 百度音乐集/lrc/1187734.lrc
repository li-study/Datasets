[00:08.49]Life without taking chances
[00:12.21]Is no kind of life at all
[00:16.40]You've gotta stand up for something
[00:20.17]Even if you might fall
[00:25.24]Gotta take that road
[00:27.52]Wherever it might go
[00:32.13]No matter where
[00:34.05]No matter what
[00:35.91]I want you to know
[00:37.90]I want you to know
[00:41.19]I...
[00:43.37]Try to do my best
[00:45.17]To do the best I could
[00:49.06]I...
[00:51.19]Had to give my all
[00:52.96]It's what I had to do
[00:57.15]And I'd...
[00:59.57]Do it all again
[01:00.88]And that's the honest truth
[01:05.08]I...
[01:07.10]I did it for you
[01:16.25]Maybe I was crazy
[01:19.90]I guess I was sometimes
[01:23.97]And maybe it's hard to chase this
[01:27.92]But I had to know what's right
[01:32.92]Everyday you've got to live
[01:36.57]For what you believe
[01:39.88]Please understand
[01:41.79]I had no choice
[01:43.37]It's what had to be
[01:45.39]It's what had to be
[01:48.87]I...
[01:50.82]Try to do my best
[01:52.73]To do the best I could
[01:57.29]I...
[01:59.45]Had to give my all
[02:01.22]It's what I had to do
[02:05.29]And I'd...
[02:07.44]Do it all again
[02:08.69]And that's the honest truth
[02:13.29]I...
[02:15.19]I did it for you
[02:18.74]Oh,
[02:24.24]And I had no choice, no
[02:28.13]It was something that I believed
[02:30.31]A dream that was driving me
[02:32.34]A fire inside of me
[02:35.41]I...
[02:37.41]Try to do my best
[02:39.17]To do the best I could
[02:43.48]And I...
[02:45.33]Had to give my all
[02:46.93]It's what I had to do
[02:51.33]I'd...
[02:53.37]Do it all again
[02:55.02]And that's the honest truth
[02:59.18]I...
[03:01.22]I did it for you
[03:05.58]Oh
[03:07.38]I...
[03:09.42]I did it for you
[03:17.66]I did it for you
