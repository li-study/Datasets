[00:00.75]the drowners
[00:35.67]Won't someone give me a gun?
[00:42.50]Oh, well it's for my brother
[00:48.85]Well he writes the line wrote down my spine
[00:55.11]It says "Oh do you believe in love there?"
[01:04.70]So slow down, so slow down,
[01:12.77] you're taking me over
[01:19.88]And so we drown, Sir we drown,
[01:25.57]stop taking me over
[01:30.92]Won't someone give me more fun?
[01:39.65](and the skin flies all around us)
[01:43.95]We kiss in his room to a popular tune
[01:50.54]Oh, real drowners
[02:44.11][02:00.29]Slow down, slow down,
[02:51.59][02:07.94]you're taking me over
[02:56.59][02:13.29]And so we drown, Sir we drown,
[03:04.45][02:20.86]stop taking me over!
