[00:01.68]There's a cabin in a valley,
[00:06.41]My grandpa built on your land.
[00:11.55]Your mountains are a canvas,
[00:14.85]For the makers hand.
[00:16.69]
[00:22.44]Tonight I'm fishing up a river,
[00:27.29]If only in my mind.
[00:32.31]No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time.
[00:40.51]
[00:43.31]I carry you in my heart
[00:48.42]your memory comes over me like the dark and
[00:53.21]
[00:53.78]Like a phone call from my baby,
[00:58.85]Sayin' honey I miss ya like crazy.
[01:04.15]Like the sound of a siren song,
[01:08.22]Oh Carolina, ya keep callin me home.
[01:17.53]Callin' me home.
[01:22.44]
[01:25.01]Sometimes I grow weary,
[01:30.24]From goin' all the time.
[01:35.52]I love to take a minute,
[01:38.08]Let you ease my mind.
[01:43.13]
[01:45.45]I'd love to see my mama
[01:51.10]Maybe go for a drive
[01:55.75]But I gotta play the star in some little town again tonight
[02:03.96]
[02:06.79]Don't get me wrong
[02:09.38]I love what I do
[02:11.99]It's just another song about missing you
[02:16.56]
[02:17.24]Like a phone call from my baby,
[02:22.27]Sayin' honey I miss ya like crazy.
[02:27.67]Kinda like the sound of a siren song,
[02:31.72]Oh Carolina, ya keep callin me home.
[02:41.00]Callin' me home.
[02:45.61]Callin' me home
[02:51.30]Callin' me home
[02:59.39]Oh, oh, we're almost home
[03:08.24]
[03:09.53]Like a phone call from my baby
[03:14.35]Sayin honey I miss ya, I miss ya like crazy
[03:19.72]Just like the song of a siren song
[03:23.04]
[03:24.05]Oh Carolina,
[03:27.92]Carolina,
[03:30.28]Carolina,
[03:32.69]Keep callin me home,
[03:38.44]Callin' me home,
[03:43.70]Callin' me home,
[03:48.79]Callin' me home
[03:53.71]
[03:59.17]Carolina,
[04:01.66]Carolina,
[04:04.15]Keep callin' me home.
