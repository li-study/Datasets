[00:01.23]3 Doors Down - When You're Young
[00:04.00]
[00:13.03]So far away from knowing where I am going
[00:19.45]I am trying hard to find out who I am
[00:25.49]They all see that I don't know what I am doing
[00:31.62]I say they don't hardly understand
[00:35.99]
[00:38.65]Why can't they remember
[00:43.83]What I will never forget
[00:49.92]How these dreams can come undone
[00:55.61]When you're young
[00:58.34]
[01:04.09]You give what you give 'cause they make you
[01:09.94]Trapped inside a place that won't take you
[01:16.51]And they want you to be what they make you
[01:22.03]It's already over and done
[01:26.77]When you're young
[01:28.88]
[01:29.96]Everything seems perfect
[01:35.41]Everything's okay
[01:41.62]And it will all get better now
[01:47.70]At least that's what they say
[01:52.60]But I don't see it coming
[01:58.03]
[02:00.19]You give what you give 'cause they make you
[02:06.34]Trapped inside a place that won't take you
[02:12.64]And they want you to be what they make you
[02:18.03]It's already over and done
[02:22.70]When you're young
[02:24.78]
[02:25.77]Days really just seem longer
[02:30.31]They say it's better this way
[02:37.55]I hope one day I am stronger than I feel
[02:42.56]And I hope it feels different than today
[02:49.80]
[03:02.34]You give what you give 'cause they make you
[03:08.33]Trapped inside a place that won't take you
[03:14.87]And they want you to be what they make you
[03:20.40](It's already over and done)
[03:26.41](It's already over and done)
[03:32.68](It's already over and done)
[03:37.52]When you're young
[03:40.06]
[03:44.05]Why can't they remember
[03:49.55]What I will never forget
[03:55.90]How these dreams can come undone
[04:01.30]When you're young
[04:03.92]
