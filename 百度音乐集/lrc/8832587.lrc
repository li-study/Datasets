[00:15.31]
[00:35.65]Sometimes I feel
[00:41.37]Like I don’t belong anywhere
[00:47.91]And it’s gonna take so long
[00:53.74]For me to get somewhere
[01:00.29]Sometimes I feel
[01:02.49]So heavy hearted
[01:06.43]But I can’t explain
[01:08.35]Cuz I’m so guarded
[01:11.87]But that’s a lonely road to travel
[01:18.12]And a heavy load to bare
[01:23.74]And it’s a long, long way to heaven
[01:28.63]But I gotta get there
[01:34.47]Can you send an angel?
[01:40.37]Can you send me an angel?
[01:46.56]Guide me
