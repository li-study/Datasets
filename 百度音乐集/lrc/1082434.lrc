[00:16.55]I have always believed
[00:19.50]God won't give me more than I can handle
[00:24.19]But sometimes when it's so hard
[00:26.91]And I'm falling apart
[00:29.16]I wonder if I can take this
[00:32.09]Hurt I'm going through
[00:35.75]But I know no matter what I do
[00:40.77]
[00:41.29]They won't all be sunny days
[00:45.47]Life's gonna bring out some rain
[00:49.26]But I can restore it
[00:51.27]I'll be that much stronger for the pain
[00:57.83]So even when I'm sad
[01:00.90]I know everyday I have is still beautiful
[01:06.59]

[01:11.06]
[01:14.57]There have been times in my life
[01:17.17]When all of my skies were blue and were so wide open
[01:22.23]But lately all of my dreams seem so out of reach
[01:27.18]And everything feels so broken
[01:30.09]But it can't last too long
[01:33.97]So I'll just keep on holding on
[01:39.47]
[01:39.76]They won't all be sunny days
[01:43.15]Life's gonna bring out some rain
[01:47.25]But I can restore it
[01:49.19]I'll be that much stronger for the pain
[01:55.83]So even when I'm sad
[01:59.24]I know everyday I have is still beautiful
[02:04.51]
[02:05.32]We're all gonna cry sometimes
[02:08.78]We're all gonna hurt sometimes
[02:12.90]But it takes the good and the bad
[02:15.88]The happy sad to make you feel alive
[02:23.44]
[02:27.30]They won't all be sunny days
[02:31.13]Life's gonna bring out some rain
[02:35.19]But I can restore it
[02:37.19]I'll be that much stronger for the pain
[02:43.13]
