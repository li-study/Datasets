[00:07.00]
[00:08.53]Ten women (ten women)
[00:10.98]Ten women
[00:12.51]Between you and me
[00:15.17]
[00:17.51]Ten women (ten women)
[00:19.48]Ten women
[00:21.39]The nightmare and the fantasy
[00:25.15]
[00:26.02]Ten women
[00:27.53]The thrill and the shame
[00:30.06]Ten women
[00:32.02]I miss you the same
[00:33.63]
[00:34.61]While you're kissing the ring
[00:37.08]Of some good timing king
[00:39.40]Ten women
[00:40.87]A fool I have made
[00:43.38]
[00:45.92]Two faces (two faces)
[00:48.16]Two faces
[00:49.65]Two faces you have
[00:52.20]
[00:54.29]Two faces (two faces)
[00:56.64]Two faces
[00:58.27]Keep one in your bag
[01:01.14]
[01:02.85]Two faces
[01:05.03]From which you can choose
[01:07.21]Two faces
[01:09.00]And neither are you
[01:11.25]
[01:12.13]Well I'm biding my time
[01:14.36]Like a cellar of wine
[01:16.39]With two faces
[01:18.05]You'll never be true
[01:20.63]
[02:00.53]One witness (one witness)
[02:03.56]One witness
[02:05.10]Is all that I need
[02:07.71]
[02:09.58]One witness (one witness)
[02:12.29]One witness
[02:13.76]Just someone to see
[02:16.90]
[02:18.56]One witness
[02:20.39]To all that's been done
[02:22.55]One witness
[02:24.76]Whose eyes will not run
[02:27.07]
[02:27.92]Just someone to shout
[02:30.09]In this big, empty house
[02:32.17]One witness
[02:33.61]To mourn for our love
[02:36.39]
[02:38.33]Ten women (ten women)
[02:41.05]Ten women
[02:42.65]Between you and me
[02:45.06]
[02:47.21]Ten women (ten women)
[02:49.83]Ten women
[02:51.25]The glory and the tragedy
[02:55.69]
[02:56.54]Ten women
[02:58.13]To trust and betray
[03:00.19]Ten women
[03:02.38]I want you the same
[03:04.85]
[03:05.62]It will be like it's been
[03:07.53]If you come home again
[03:09.65]With ten women
[03:11.34]Who have all gone away
[03:14.16]
