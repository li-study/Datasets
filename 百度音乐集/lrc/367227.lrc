[00:09.65]
[00:11.82]Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
[00:21.57]
[00:21.79]People say love
[00:24.30]Comes and goes, but
[00:26.71]They don't understand
[00:28.42]What they don't know
[00:30.82]Cause, what I feel starts
[00:34.32]Deep inside
[00:36.28]It's kinda like a sea
[00:37.76]That springs into life
[00:40.55]They say it's not right
[00:43.09]And we move too fast
[00:44.89]But they don't know the meaning
[00:47.79]Of what we have
[00:49.99]Wherever it is, I'll fly
[00:52.52]Whatever it takes, I'll try
[00:54.98]So don't pay no mind
[00:57.54]To whatever people say
[01:00.06]Whenever it is in my life
[01:02.52]Know that I will be on time
[01:05.33]'Cause you know why
[01:07.75]There's no standing in our way
[01:10.56]
[01:11.72]Da, da, da, da, da, da
[01:21.31]
[01:21.61]When you're far and
[01:23.87]We're apart
[01:25.55]I'm really missing you
[01:27.62]I wanna be where you are
[01:30.30]
[01:30.50]They say it's not right (it's not right)
[01:32.98]And it won't last (it won't last)
[01:35.90]No point believing
[01:38.50]What we have
[01:40.18]
[01:40.40]Wherever it is, I'll fly
[01:42.95]Whatever it takes, I'll try
[01:45.38]So don't pay no mind
[01:47.79]To whatever people say
[01:50.34]Whenever it is in my life
[01:52.89]I'll be on time
[01:55.78]'Cause you know why
[01:58.15]There's no standing in my way
[02:00.62]
[02:00.81]And if you're lost
[02:02.66]I'm gonna find you
[02:05.39]'Cause without you
[02:07.48]I'll break down and cry
[02:10.37]And you know why
[02:12.45]I wanna surround you
[02:15.59]With all my love
[02:22.62]
[02:41.83]Wherever it is, I'll fly
[02:44.43]Whatever it takes, I'll try
[02:46.94]So don't pay no mind
[02:49.62]To whatever people say
[02:51.93]Whenever it is in my life
[02:54.34]Know that I will be on time
[02:57.18]'Cause you know why
[02:59.69]There's no standing in my way
[03:02.76]
[03:03.11]Da, da, da, da, da, da
[03:10.07]Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
