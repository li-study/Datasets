[00:01.58]Satisfied
[00:04.55]Natalie Imbruglia
[00:07.60]
[00:10.75]This summer time I have no fury
[00:15.46]No chance of sinking sailing ships
[00:19.86]If time stood still I’d take aim and fire
[00:24.75]For you
[00:30.44]For every ocean there must be shore
[00:35.15]On which I stand with restless toes
[00:39.45]When everything
[00:42.03]I look for in myself is in you
[01:38.99][00:49.96]I feel a little more than empty
[01:43.74][00:54.69]But I wanna feel more than full
[03:10.15][02:50.57][02:30.89][01:49.36][01:00.42]It’s a pity all I have
[03:12.56][02:52.91][02:33.30][01:51.78][01:02.77]Is just enough to keep you satisfied
[03:20.07][03:00.46][02:40.90][01:59.11][01:10.18]This knot can come undone
[03:22.61][03:02.76][02:43.16][02:01.54][01:12.50]no matter how we try to keep it tied
[01:19.47]Inside this bottle theres a message
[01:24.16]You may be drinking way too much
[01:28.44]If I had the strength
[01:31.10]to take the weight of you I would
[02:10.26]Something high it keeps me here
[02:12.80]Something that keeps us together
[02:15.21]
[02:17.61]You keep me dry despite the weather
[02:20.12]I don’t need to feel this way
[02:22.45]For you but I do end up feel satisfied
