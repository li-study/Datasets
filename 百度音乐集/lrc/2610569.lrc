[00:20.96]
[00:22.96]Isn't it a gamble
[00:25.02]Layin' your heart out on the floor
[00:30.07]Nothin' short of a miracle
[00:32.93]When you find the one you're looking for
[00:37.59]It's another kind of trouble trying to hang on to who you are
[00:45.15]When all you wanna do is lose yourself in someone else's arms
[00:53.31]Isn't it a wonder (that) we got this far
[00:58.20]
[00:58.64]Some people aren't lucky like us
[01:02.41]Some people they just give up
[01:06.04]When the hard times fall
[01:08.61]The thrill of it all is gone
[01:11.19]Leaves you in a cloud of dust
[01:13.57]It's sad to think that some won't find it
[01:17.43]And others won't recognize it even when it comes
[01:21.33]We're all at the mercy of the will of love
[01:25.01]Some people yeah
[01:26.98]Some people aren't lucky like us
[01:30.25]
[01:33.08]Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate
[01:40.23]Look how much we've been given babe
[01:43.21]In spite of all of our mistakes
[01:47.73]And I will never forget
[01:49.62]I've been blessed with the gift of lovin' you
[01:55.30]And when the going aint easy babe
[01:58.62]A little faith will pull us through
[02:03.08]Thank God we have eachother we can hang onto
[02:07.89]
[02:08.82]Some people aren't lucky like us
[02:12.39]Some people they just give up
[02:16.13]When the hard times fall
[02:18.73]The thrill of it all is gone
[02:21.36]Leaves you in a cloud of dust
[02:23.76]It's sad to think that some won't find it
[02:27.52]And others won't recognize it even when it comes
[02:31.45]We're all at the mercy of the will of love
[02:35.16]Some people yeah

[02:40.34]
[02:41.79]To have someone you can laugh with
[02:44.31]Someone you can cry with
[02:46.39]Tell all your secrets to
[02:49.47]To have someone who won't judge you
[02:51.86]Someone who just loves you
[02:53.71]No matter what, they stand beside you
[02:59.52]
[02:59.96]Some people aren't lucky like us
[03:03.64]Some people they just give up
[03:07.46]When the hard times fall
[03:09.79]The thrill of it all is gone
[03:12.69]Leaves you in a cloud of dust
[03:14.98]It's sad to think that some never gonna find it
[03:19.08]And others won't recognize it even when it comes
[03:22.76]We're all at the mercy of the will of love
[03:26.39]Some people yeah
