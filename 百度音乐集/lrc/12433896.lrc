[00:05.68]Lemonheads"It's A Shame About Ray"歌词
[00:08.98]
[00:32.02]I've never been too good with names
[00:39.51]The cellar door was open, i could never stay away
[00:47.03]I know it's prob'ly not my place
[00:54.06]It's either or, i'm hoping for a simple way to say.
[01:01.63]It's a shame about ray
[01:08.95]In the stone, under the dust
[01:11.84]His name is still engraved
[01:15.90]Some things need to go away
[01:23.58]It's a shame about ray
[01:26.79]
[01:52.81]If i make it through today
[01:59.96]I'll know tomorrow not to leave my feelings out on display
[02:06.99]I'll put the cobwebs back in place
[02:14.68]I've never been to good with names
[02:17.70]But i remember faces
[02:21.98]It's a shame about ray.
[02:29.00]In the stone, under the dust
[02:32.10]His name is still engraved
[02:35.97]Some things need to go away
[02:43.76]It's a shame about ray
[02:46.78]
