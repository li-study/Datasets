[00:18.64]下起雨来
[00:20.20]
[00:20.50]心有些乱
[00:21.82]
[00:22.61]电话也响
[00:23.69]
[00:24.56]该怎么办
[00:26.06]
[00:26.66]人都走了吧
[00:28.22]
[00:28.73]房间空的
[00:30.05]
[00:30.83]心凉凉的
[00:31.86]
[00:32.79]又何必呢
[00:33.96]
[00:34.86]刮起风了
[00:36.45]
[00:36.84]脚步已乱
[00:37.92]
[00:38.94]电话已挂断
[00:40.42]
[00:40.89]杯子翻了
[00:42.09]
[00:42.79]心摔碎了
[00:44.14]
[00:44.83]起起落落
[00:46.21]
[00:47.02]有没一种
[00:48.18]
[00:48.93]别样的生活
[00:50.76]
[00:51.87]看似遥远 就在身边
[00:59.20]
[00:59.95]看似遥远 就在身边

[01:53.56]
[01:54.14]诡异眼睛
[01:55.22]
[01:56.06]却很透明
[01:57.44]
[01:58.16]夜是紫色
[01:59.60]
[02:00.14]流动的神秘
[02:01.86]
[02:02.25]一声不吭
[02:03.57]
[02:04.23]爱着谁呢
[02:05.73]
[02:06.36]呼吸着我
[02:07.79]
[02:08.39]习惯的空气
[02:09.89]
[02:10.36]原来身体呀
[02:11.95]
[02:12.49]是飘着的
[02:14.02]
[02:14.35]没有逻辑
[02:15.80]
[02:16.52]也很快乐
[02:17.96]
[02:18.53]忘了算了
[02:19.61]
[02:20.45]想起再说
