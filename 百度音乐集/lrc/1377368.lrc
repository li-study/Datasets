[00:19.15]I been on the road now dang near all my life:
[00:26.93]An' I do love to sing a song.
[00:32.94]I can say I've worked hard, put in my time:
[00:40.54]Now it's time to go home.
[00:46.04]And catch up on my chores:
[00:52.38]Watch the sunset from my porch.
[00:59.16]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me,
[01:06.91]Drinkin' in that great wide-open: soakin' up the summer breeze.
[01:13.74]Kickin' back an' settled in with my family.
[01:19.72]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me.
[01:29.16]That's where I got started, where I was born an' bred:
[01:36.68]It's the fire inside of me.
[01:42.73]I couldn't have imagined this Texas highway led,
[01:50.22]Far beyond my wildest dreams.
[01:54.94]But I'll turn out the lights tonight,
[02:02.07]An' say goodnight, but not goodbye.
[02:08.92]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me,
[02:16.53]Drinkin' in that great wide-open: soakin' up the summer breeze.
[02:23.24]Kickin' back an' settled in with my family.
[02:29.33]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me.
[02:48.41]I made so many friends,
[02:54.86]Hope we meet someday again:
[03:02.31]Till then:
[03:05.37]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me,
[03:12.78]Drinkin' in that great wide-open: soakin' up the summer breeze.
[03:19.60]Kickin' back an' settled in with my family.
[03:25.73]I'll be somewhere down in Texas if you're lookin' for me.
