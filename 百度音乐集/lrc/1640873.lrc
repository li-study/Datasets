[00:23.22]If he keeps exchanging for new shoes, I need to
[00:28.85]Come right back and be alone again
[00:34.10]Maybe I didn't make good use, out of him
[00:40.05]Didn't come with no type of warranty
[00:44.34]
[00:45.36]There's no one

[00:47.74]more than your love
[00:49.44]it hurts me more
[00:50.52]to let you back
[00:51.78]in again
[00:56.07]there's no one
[00:57.16]who could ever
[00:58.87]show me the
[01:00.25]way to never
[01:01.81]trust someone
[01:03.01]better than you

[01:29.77]Don't wanna go through the same games, again
[01:35.06]He's no good and that's just it for me
[01:39.80]Does it everytime he returns, there's no use
[01:45.97]I'll just be the one left in the end
[01:50.60]

[02:06.14]way to never
[02:07.67]trust someone
[02:09.08]better than you
[02:11.87]
[03:07.12]Don't wanna go through the same thing
[03:11.15]The memory remains
[03:13.78]Don't wanna go through the same games, baby
[03:41.30]
[03:52.54][03:41.83]There's no one I adore
[03:55.21][03:43.86]And you know it hurts me more
[03:57.69][03:46.78]To let you back into my life
[04:00.46][03:49.45]You ain't never treat me right
