[00:48.81]In New York freedom looks like too many choices
[00:56.33]In New York I found a friend to drown out the other voices
[01:02.95]Voices on a cell phone
[01:04.87]Voices from home
[01:06.83]Voices of the hard sell
[01:08.75]Voices down the stairwell
[01:10.39]In New York
[01:13.14]Just got a place in New York
[01:19.04]In new York summers get hot
[01:23.54]Well into the hundreds
[01:27.10]You cant walk around the block without a change of clothing
[01:33.50]Hot as a hairdryer in your face
[01:37.31]Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
[01:41.14]In New York
[01:43.20]I just got a place in New York ,New York ,New York
[01:57.19]In New York you can forget
[02:01.74]forget how to sit still
[02:04.96]Tell yourself you will stay in
[02:08.83]But its down to Alphaville
[02:15.42]New York ,New York....
[02:43.89]The Irish have been coming here for years
[02:47.88]Feel like they own the place

[02:57.81]Irish ,Italian ,Jews and Hispanics
[03:01.54]Religious nuts ,political fanatics in the stew
[03:06.85]Living happily not like me and you

[03:53.01]In New York I lost it all to you and your vices
[04:00.19]Still I am staying on to figure out my mid life crisis
[04:07.74]I hit an iceberg in my life
[04:11.71]But you know I am still afloat
[04:15.55]You lose your balance ,lose you wife
[04:19.80]In the queue for the lifeboat
[04:22.16]You got to put the women and children first
[04:26.02]But youve got an unquenchable thirst for New York
[04:44.89]In the stillness of every evening
[04:48.64]When the sun has had its day
[04:52.48]I heard your voice a whispering come away child
[05:00.51]New York , New York........
