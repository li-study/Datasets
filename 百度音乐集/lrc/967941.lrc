[00:01.63]Goodbye Alice In Wonderland
[00:02.53]Jewel
[00:05.02]
[00:17.06]It's four in the afternoon
[00:21.16]I'm on a flight leaving L.A.
[00:29.75]Trying to think about my life
[00:33.92]My youth scattered along the highway
[00:40.03]
[00:42.11]Hotel rooms and headlines
[00:47.57]I've made a living with a song
[00:54.08]Just a guitar as my companion
[00:58.06]Wanting desperately to belong
[01:03.31]
[01:05.71]Fame is filled with spoiled children
[01:11.58]They grow fat on fantasy
[01:18.52]I guess that's why I'm leaving
[01:22.60]I crave reality
[01:26.18]
[01:29.53]So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
[01:38.26]Goodbye yellow brick road
[01:44.19]There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
[01:49.57]I did not find paradise
[01:55.14]It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching
[02:04.68]For what was missing in my life
[02:08.67]
[02:14.05]I'm embarassed to say the rest is a rock and roll cliche
[02:18.58]I hit the bottom when I reached the top
[02:26.01]I never knew it was you who was breaking my heart
[02:30.49]I thought you had to love me
[02:34.38]You did not
[02:37.19]
[02:37.92]Yes a heart can hallucinate
[02:44.48]If it's completely starved for love
[02:51.20]Can even make monsters seem like
[02:58.54]Angels from above
[03:01.25]
[03:02.84]You forged my love like a weapon
[03:08.73]And turned it against me like a knife
[03:15.83]You broke my last heartstring
[03:21.37]But you opened up my eyes
[03:24.18]
[03:26.81]So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
[03:35.00]Goodbye yellow brick road
[03:41.52]There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
[03:46.50]That was not love in your eyes
[03:52.38]It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
[04:01.80]what was missing in my life
[04:06.01]
[04:06.59]And growing up is not the absence of dreaming
[04:09.22]It's being able to understand the difference between the ones you can hold
[04:13.71]And the ones that you've been sold
[04:18.46]Dreaming is a good thing cause it brings new things to life
[04:21.31]Pretending is an ending that perpetuates a lie
[04:24.49]Forgetting what you are
[04:26.29]Seeing for what you've been told
[04:29.56]
[04:32.85]Well, truth is stranger than fiction
[04:37.52]And this is my chance to get it right
[04:44.58]Life is much better without all of your pretty lies
[04:53.77]
[04:55.45]So Goodbye Alice in Wonderland
[05:03.91]You can keep your yellow brick road
[05:10.16]Cause there is a difference between dreaming and pretending
[05:15.68]That was not love in your eyes
[05:20.89]It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
[05:28.81]It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wishing
[05:37.59]That you were what was missing from my life
