[00:17.46]I ain't got no money
[00:21.49]I ain't like those other guys you hang around
[00:25.64]And it's kinda funny
[00:30.02]But they always seem to let you down
[00:33.78]And I get discouraged
[00:38.33]'cause I never see you anymore
[00:42.05]And I need your love, babe yeah
[00:44.87]That's all I'm living for, yeah

[01:48.17]And they say I'm so shy, yeah
