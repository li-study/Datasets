[00:12.63]My child arrived just the other day;
[00:15.25]He came to the world in the usual day,
[00:18.51]But there were planes to catch and bills to pay,
[00:21.81]He learned to walk while I was away.
[00:25.00]And he was talking before I knew it,
[00:26.67]And as he grew he'd say:
[00:28.60]"I'm going to be like you,dad,
[00:31.75]You know I'm going to be like you."
[00:36.37]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[00:39.74]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[00:42.89]"When you coming home,dad?"
[00:44.89]"I don't know when,
[00:45.92]But we'll get together then,
[00:49.01]You know we'll have a good time then."
[00:51.65]
[01:01.04]My son turned ten just the other day.
[01:03.82]He said,"Thanks for the ball,dad,come on,let's play.
[01:07.04]Can you teach me to throw?"
[01:08.31]I said,"Not today,I've got a lot to do."
[01:11.34]He said,"That's OK."
[01:13.12]And he walked away,but his smile never dimmed;
[01:15.75]He said I'm going to be like him,yeah.
[01:19.37]You know I'm going to be like him.
[01:23.91]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[01:27.08]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[01:30.13]"When you coming home,dad?"
[01:31.60]"I don't know when,
[01:32.96]But we'll get together then,
[01:35.91]You know we'll have a good time then."
[01:38.58]
[01:47.14]Well,he came from college just the other day,
[01:50.60]So much like a man,I just had to say,
[01:53.57]"Son,I'm proud of you,can you sit for a while?"
[01:56.73]He shook his head and said with a smile,
[01:59.68]"What I'd really like,Dad,is to borrow the car keys.
[02:03.24]See you later,can I have them please?"
[02:07.33]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[02:10.50]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[02:13.50]"When you coming home,son?"
[02:15.08]"I don't know when,
[02:16.56]But we'll get together then,
[02:19.56]You know we'll have a good time then."
[02:22.60]
[02:37.83]I've long since retired,my son's moved away
[02:41.49]I called him up just the other day.
[02:44.46]I said,"I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
[02:48.12]He said,"I'd love to,Dad,if I can fine the time.
[02:52.70]You see,my new job's a worry and the kids have the flu,
[02:55.53]But it's sure nice talking to you,dad.
[02:58.67]It's sure been nice talking to you."
[03:03.40]And as I hung up the phone,it occurred to me,
[03:06.31]He'd grown up just like me
[03:09.69]My boy was just like me.
[03:14.31]And the cat's in the crader and the silver spoon,
[03:17.59]Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
[03:20.67]"When you coming home,son?"
[03:22.05]"I don't know when,
[03:23.80]But we'll get together then,
[03:26.85]You know we'll have a good time then."
