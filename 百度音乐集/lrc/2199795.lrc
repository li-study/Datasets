[00:20.55]to san francisco, double dutch disco,
[00:22.76]tech tv hottie, do it for scotty

[00:25.44]do it for the monsters under your bed
[00:26.86]do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom
[00:28.47]broken hearts hurt but they make us strong and
[02:12.36][02:05.42][01:58.85][01:52.46][00:36.91][00:30.33]we won't stop until somebody calls the cops
[02:14.46][02:08.05][02:01.47][01:54.88][00:39.20][00:32.69]and even then we'll start again and just pretend that
[02:17.64][02:11.01][02:04.41][01:57.53][00:42.26][00:35.70]nothing ever happened

[02:20.47][00:44.74]singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
[02:22.35][00:46.50]on the sleeve of how it used to be
[00:48.83]how's it gonna be?
[00:49.88]i'll drop kick russell stover, move into the starting over house
[00:52.78]and know matt rouse and jest are watching me achieve my dreams
[00:56.19]and we'll pray, all damn day, every day,
[00:59.32]that all this shit our president has got us in will go away
[01:03.17]while we strive to figure out a way we can survive
[01:06.24]these trying times without losing our minds
[01:09.14]so if you wanna burn yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
[01:12.53]and if you wanna cut yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
[01:15.93]and if you wanna kill yourself remember that I LOVE YOU
[01:19.21]call me up before your dead, we can make some plans instead
[01:22.30]send me an IM, i'll be your friend
[01:25.65]shysters live from scheme to scheme and my 4th quarter pipe dreams
[01:28.74]are seeming more and more worth fighting for
[01:32.02]so i'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation
[01:35.59]and i'll say FUCK BUSH AND FUCK THIS WAR
[01:38.92]my war paint is sharpie ink and i'll show you how much my shit stinks
[01:41.89]and ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
[01:45.40]they think we're disposable, well both my thumbs opposable
[01:48.49]are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score
