[00:19.05]Years ago, when I was younger
[00:23.09]I kinda liked a girl I knew
[00:27.82]She was mine, and we were sweethearts
[00:32.13]That was then but then it's true
[00:35.74]
[00:37.06]I'm in love with a fairytale,
[00:41.26]Even though it hurts
[00:45.45]'Cause I don't care if I loose my mind
[00:50.05]I'm already cursed
[00:54.65]
[01:13.39]Every day we start a fighting
[01:17.68]Every night we fell in love
[01:22.24]No one else could make me sadder
[01:26.50]But no one else could lift me high above
[01:30.80]
[01:31.61]I don't know, what I was doing
[01:35.29]When suddenly, we fell apart
[01:40.23]Nowadays, I cannot find her
[01:44.24]But when I do, we'll get a brand new start
[01:49.52]
[01:51.38]I'm in love with a fairytale,
[01:55.62]Even though it hurts
[01:59.87]'Cause I don't care, if I loose my mind
[02:04.54]I'm already cursed
[02:09.16]
[02:29.31]She's a fairytale yeah
[02:35.48]Even though it hurts
[02:39.89]'Cause I don't care, if I loose my mind
[02:44.47]I'm already cursed
[02:49.27]
