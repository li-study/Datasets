[00:10.34]Title: My Iron Lung
[00:19.81]Faith, you're driving me away
[00:25.82]You do it everyday
[00:30.57]You don't mean it
[00:33.64]But it hurts like hell
[00:37.74]My brain says I'm receiving pain
[00:43.60]A lack of oxygen
[00:48.50]From my life support
[00:54.47]My iron lung
[01:01.27]We're too young to fall asleep
[01:15.60]To cynical to speak
[01:20.35]We are losing it
[01:23.91]Can't you tell?
[01:28.51]We scratch our eternal itch
[01:35.23]A twentieth century bitch
[01:40.03]And we are grateful for
[01:43.48]Our iron lung
[01:50.20]The headshrinkers, they want everything
[01:59.25]My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
[02:08.30]The headshrinkers, they want everything
[02:17.35]My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
[02:26.40]Suck, suck your teenage thumb
[02:35.45]Toilet trained and dumb
[02:38.95]When the power runs out
[02:42.61]We'll just hum
[02:47.12]This, this is our new song
[02:52.13]Just like the last one
[02:57.18]A total waste of time
[03:00.28]My iron lung
[03:05.69]The headshrinkers, they want everything
[03:10.65]My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
[03:14.96]The headshrinkers, they want everything
[03:19.27]My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
[03:27.87]And if you're frightened
[03:45.20]You can be frightened
[03:47.55]You can be, it's OK
[03:51.90]And if you're frightened
[03:54.51]You can be frightened
[03:56.96]You can be, it's OK
[04:17.96]The headshrinkers, they want everything
[04:22.12]My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
[04:28.51]
