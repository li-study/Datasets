[00:11]Disappointment you shouldn't have done
[00:18]You couldn't have done
[00:19]You wouldn't have done
[00:21]the things you did there
[00:22]And we could 've been happy
[00:26]What a piteous thing, a hideous thing
[00:30]was tainted by the rest
[00:32]But it won't get any harder
[00:37]And I hope you'll find your way again
[00:43]But it won't get any higher
[00:49]But it all boils down to what you did there
[01:15]In the night we fight, I feel you're right
[01:27]It was exactly there
[01:33]I decided
[01:38]and drew you out
[01:47]In the night we fight, I feel you're right
[01:49]It was exactly there
[01:55]I decided
[02:21]But it won't get any harder
[02:27]And I hope you'll find your way again
[02:32]But it won't get any higher
[02:38]But it all boils down to what you did there
[03:10]Disappointment
