[00:25.65]Here I am again in this mean old town
[00:30.53]And you're so far away from me
[00:33.99]And where are you when the sun goes down
[00:39.05]You're so far away from me
[00:43.25]So far away from me
[00:47.55]So far I just can't see
[00:51.84]So far away from me
[00:56.07]You're so far away from me
[01:02.62]
[01:11.78]I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
[01:16.57]When you're so far away from me
[01:20.27]I'm tired of making out on the telephone
[01:25.40]And you're so far away from me
[01:29.38]So far away from me
[01:33.51]So far I just can't see
[01:37.77]So far away from me
[01:41.82]You're so far away from me
[01:47.59]
[02:06.05]I get so tired when I have to explain
[02:11.33]When you're so far away from me
[02:13.97]See you been in the sun and I've been in the rain
[02:19.20]And you're so far away from me
[02:23.59]So far away from me
[02:27.79]So far I just can't see
[02:31.92]So far away from me
[02:36.78]You're so far away from me
[02:43.06]
[03:23.01][03:19.26][03:02.27][02:57.72]You're so far away from me
