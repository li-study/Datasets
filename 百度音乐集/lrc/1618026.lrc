[00:01.61]Changes
[00:03.50]Black Sabbath
[00:08.50]I feel unhappy, I feel so sad,
[00:16.80]I lost the best friend that I ever had,
[00:26.27]She was my woman, I loved her so,
[00:34.80]But it's too late now, I've let her go
[00:47.53]I'm going through changes
[00:54.56]I'm going through changes
[01:32.29]We shared the years, we shared each day,
[01:41.50]In love together we found a way,
[01:50.86]But soon the world had its evil way,
[01:57.55]My heart was blinded,
[02:02.36]Love went astray
[02:10.30]I'm going through changes
[02:19.16]I'm going through changes
[03:13.57]It took so long to realize,
[03:22.37]And I can still hear her last goodbyes,
[03:31.14]Now all my days are filled with tears,
[03:39.52]Wish I could go back and change these years
[03:51.50]I'm going through changes
[04:01.08]I'm going through changes
