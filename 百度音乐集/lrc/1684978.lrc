[00:16.00]
[00:16.82]It was just my mistake
[00:21.29]Thinking you cared
[00:25.66]It was just my mistake
[00:30.13]Thinking you'd be there
[00:34.57]That you'd be by my side
[00:38.79]And that you wouldn't lie
[00:43.35]My mistake
[00:48.38]
[00:52.45]It was just my false hope
[00:57.00]Thinking we'd last, yeah
[01:01.34]It was just my false hope
[01:05.62]Forgot all your pests
[01:10.22]All those girls you denied
[01:14.51]Smashed up hearts hung out to dry
[01:18.36]
[01:18.64]I know it's wrong
[01:22.99]Hanging on too long
[01:27.33]I know it's wrong
[01:32.02]Hanging on too long
[01:36.72]But I beat 'em all
[01:40.78]Hanging on too long
[01:45.27]
[01:50.50]I was a fool for you
[01:54.57]Right from the start, yeah
[01:59.03]I was a fool for you
[02:03.08]Hoping for a spark
[02:08.28]For some kind of sign
[02:12.29]That you would be mine
[02:16.16]
[02:16.45]I know it's wrong, I do
[02:20.94]Hanging on too long
[02:25.04]And I know it's wrong
[02:29.60]Hanging on too long
[02:32.92]
[02:34.10]My heart was clutching
[02:38.54]To one fair right
[02:43.41]My head was pumping
[02:47.48]It could put up a fight
[02:51.69]
[02:52.09]I know it's wrong
[02:56.56]Hanging on too long
[03:00.62]And I know it's wrong
[03:05.25]Hanging on too long
[03:09.72]And I need to move on
[03:14.04]I'm hanging on too long
[03:19.35]
[03:27.26]I know it's wrong
[03:32.06]Hanging on too long
[03:36.25]And I know it's wrong
[03:40.74]Hanging on too long
[03:45.71]
