[00:-3.00]Owl City - Tidal Wave
[00:-2.00]

[00:00.50]
[00:01.12]I wish I could cross my arms and cross your mind
[00:07.34]Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
[00:13.42]All my life I wish I broke mirrors instead of promises
[00:19.09]Cause all I see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
[00:25.56]I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
[00:31.05]Cause I'm so afraid, is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train
[00:37.88]Lift your arms, only heaven knows where the danger grows
[00:44.00]And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
[00:55.08]help is on the way
[00:56.29]
[00:56.58]I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
[01:02.71]Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me
[01:08.90]
[01:21.13]Depression please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
[01:27.49]Oh please be done, how much longer can this drama afford to run
[01:33.70]Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend
[01:39.89]But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
[01:57.61]
[01:58.31]I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
[02:04.75]Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me
[02:10.78]Then I was given grace and love
[02:14.80]I was blind but now I can see
[02:17.09]Cause I've found a new hope from above
[02:21.26]And courage swept over me
[02:23.81]
[02:34.62]It hurts just to wake up whenever you're wearing thin
[02:40.44]Alone on the outside
[02:43.28]So tired of looking in
[02:46.51]The end is uncertain
[02:49.54]And I've never been so afraid
[02:52.53]But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
[02:56.77]And that makes me feel brave
[03:03.46]
