[00:32]Summer came and left without a warning
[00:37]All at once I looked and you were gone
[00:43]And now you're looking back at me
[00:46]Searching for a way that we can be
[00:51]like we were before
[00:55]Now I'm back to what I knew before you
[01:00]Somehow the city doesn't look the same
[01:06]I'd give my life for one more night
[01:09]Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
[01:14]Take me there again,oh
[01:20][02:32][03:43][04:05]And I remember how you loved me
[01:27][02:39][03:47][04:12]Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
[01:33][02:45][03:55]I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
[01:44]I still recall the walks along the beaches
[01:49]And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
[01:55]Rising in the afternoon
[01:58]Making love to you under the moon
[02:04]oh
[02:07]Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
[02:13]Every single breath you took was mine
[02:19]We can have it all again
[02:21]Say that you'll be with me when the sun
[02:26]brings your heart to mine
[02:29]Oh, oh
[02:57]There's only so much I can say
[03:01]So please don't run away from what we have together
[03:09]It's only you and me tonight
[03:12]So let's stay lost in flight
[03:16]Oh, won't you please surrender
[04:01]remember
