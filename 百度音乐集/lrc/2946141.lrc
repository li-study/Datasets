[00:01.10]Jamie Lidell - Hurricane
[00:07.95]
[00:12.40]Well I was walking down... before I got into the station
[00:18.12]Hoping my private life is getting the slang translation
[00:24.15]Receiving these mixed messages now
[00:27.80]From a mixed messenger
[00:31.18]I was talking so loud that you know I don't even care
[00:37.19]But if you do,
[00:39.83]You guess you know what I'm about to say
[00:50.32]
[00:50.56]Straight outta nothing
[00:53.56]Into a hurricane
[00:56.03]And now we're back to nothing
[00:59.17]Some of the things don't seem the same
[01:01.96]Some of the things don't seem the same
[01:05.04]Some of the things don't seem the same
[01:14.94]
[01:16.21]I was trapped in the darkness of a subway train
[01:22.03]Hoping you shoot me down,
[01:23.93]Before I talk myself insane
[01:29.05]Model I overdosed on you,
[01:32.55]On the monorail
[01:34.87]I was grabbing the wheel,
[01:36.48]Because it must be an afro male
[01:39.67]Hi
[01:41.16]Now I don't really a little know
[01:43.82]If you believe me to let me be
[01:47.41]But if you do,
[01:48.70]You guess you know what I'm about to say
[01:52.99]
[01:53.22]Straight outta nothing
[01:57.85]Into a hurricane
[02:00.97]And now we're back to nothing
[02:02.94]Some of the things don't seem the same
[02:06.04]Some of the things don't seem the same
[02:09.07]Some of the things don't seem the same
[02:25.07]
[02:26.96]Aaaah Aaah Aaah
[02:31.67]Oh oh Oohh
[02:41.65]
[02:43.08]Straight outta nothing
[02:46.29]Into a hurricane
[02:48.76]And now we're back to nothing
[02:51.58]Some of the things don't seem the same
[02:54.62]Some of the things don't seem the same
[02:57.69]Some of the things don't seem the same
