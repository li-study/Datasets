[00:23.97]You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
[00:25.69]Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
[00:29.15]Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
[00:32.07]Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
[00:34.47]Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do tome
[00:37.29]Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
[00:39.95]All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
[00:42.87]Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
[00:45.57]Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
[00:48.37]Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
[00:50.70]Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
[00:52.92]Getten drunk thrown' up
[00:54.14]Cuffed up
[00:55.75]Then I said I had enough
[00:57.53]There must be another route, way out
[00:59.33]To money and fame, I changed my name
[01:01.30]And played a different game
[01:02.58]Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
[01:04.78]If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
[01:07.16]And when I gettem
[01:08.69]I'll hittem with tha bum rush
[01:10.30]Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
[01:12.81]Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
[01:15.67]But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
[01:18.74]They got me trapped....

[01:42.66]Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
[01:44.56]Then asking my identity
[01:45.89]Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
[01:47.85]Didn't do a thing at all

[01:51.28]Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
[01:53.32]Coppers try to kill me
[01:54.80]But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
[01:56.70]Bang bang, down another casualty
[01:58.87]But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
[02:01.19]Who do you blame?
[02:02.63]It's a shame because tha mans slain
[02:04.32]He got caught in tha chains of his own game
[02:06.96]How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
[02:09.56]Sweated me, hunted me
[02:10.91]Trapped in my own community
[02:12.33]One day i'm gonna bust
[02:13.83]Blow up on this society
[02:15.09]Why did ya lie to me ?
[02:16.45]I couldn't find a trace of equality

[03:01.30]I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
[03:03.30]But now he's tha devils friend
[03:05.72]Too late to be tellin' him

[03:12.15]I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule

[03:29.76]Still lookin' for my getaway
[03:31.18]Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
[03:34.21]Trapped in a corner
[03:35.19]Dark and I couldn't see tha light
[03:36.66]Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
