[00:01.05](George Michael)
[00:30.56]These are the days of the open hand
[00:34.64]They will not be the last
[00:38.49]Look around now
[00:41.03]These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
[00:46.31]This is the year of the hungry man
[00:49.48]Whose place is in the past
[00:53.65]Hand in hand with ignorance
[00:57.50]And legitimate excuses
[01:01.19]The rich declare themselves poor
[01:03.97]And most of us are not sure
[01:08.29]If we have too much
[01:10.39]But we'll take our chances
[01:12.26]Because god's stopped keeping score
[01:15.69]I guess somewhere along the way
[01:18.61]He must have let us alt out to play
[01:23.18]Turned his back and all god's children
[01:27.53]Crept out the back door
[01:31.17]And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
[01:37.69]Hanging on to hope
[01:41.51]When there is no hope to speak of
[01:45.66]And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
[01:52.91]Well maybe we should all be praying for time
[02:29.20]These are the days of the empty hand
[02:34.19]Oh you hold on to what you can
[02:37.51]And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
[02:44.23]This is the year of the guilty man
[02:48.82]Your television takes a stand
[02:52.33]And you find that what was over there is over here
[02:59.63]So you scream from behind your door
[03:03.40]Say "what's mine is mine and not yours"
[03:07.25]I may have too much but i'll take my chances
[03:10.88]Because god's stopped keeping score
[03:14.33]And you cling to the things they sold you
[03:18.17]Did you cover your eyes when they told you
[03:21.86]That he can't come back
[03:24.23]Beacuse he has no children to come back for
[03:30.17]It's hard to love there's so much to hate
[03:33.56]Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
[03:44.61]And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
[03:53.47]So maybe we should all be praying for time
