[00:14.50]Hey where did we go
[00:17.50]Days when the rains came
[00:21.50]Down in the hollow
[00:24.50]Playin' a new game
[00:27.50]Laughing and a running hey  hey
[00:31.50]Skipping and a jumping
[00:34.50]In the misty morning fog with

[00:56.50]To Tuesday and so slow
[00:59.50]Going down the old mind With a transistor radio
[01:06.50]Standing in the sunlight laughing
[01:09.50]Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
[01:12.49]Slipping and sliding
[01:15.17]All along the water fall  with you
[01:20.50]My brown eyed girl

[02:21.81]Behind the stadium with you
[02:25.40]My brown eyed girl
[02:28.35]
