[00:02.00]Tokyo Police Club - Hands Reversed
[00:12.00]
[00:22.68]You've got to come into my kitchen for a crime
[00:28.76]You've got to shoot me up and tie me to the kite
[00:34.15]I'm gonna tell you what to do about yourself
[00:39.64]Because the breakfast of the champions is a hedonistic health
[02:38.78][01:53.40][00:46.58]Made of paper and glue
[02:41.68][01:56.48][00:49.67]You're a Rubik's cube
[02:44.03][01:58.82][00:51.86]You can buy it in cans, tin cans
[02:49.20][02:03.80][00:57.02]You were always the first
[02:52.13][02:07.01][01:00.15]But I think you've got your hands reversed
[02:58.81][02:13.54][01:07.53]Hands reversed
[03:04.05][02:18.75][01:12.05]Hands reversed and cool for sure
[01:29.35]Watching your weekends and your holidays combine
[01:35.33]Trying to color in between the dotted lines
[01:40.84]Your only souvenir's a suitcase full of sand
[01:45.95]But when you feel like you're a million then I feel like I'm a grand
