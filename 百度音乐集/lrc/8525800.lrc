[00:11.27]Have I told you how good it feels to be me
[00:17.52]when I'm in you
[00:23.45]I can only stay clean
[00:26.60]when you are around
[00:29.49]Don't let me fall
[00:35.62]If I close my eyes forever
[00:41.83]would it ease the pain
[00:43.99]Could I breathe again
[00:46.88]
[00:48.43]Maybe I'm addicted
[00:50.97]I'm out of control
