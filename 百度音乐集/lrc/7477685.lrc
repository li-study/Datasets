[00:00.00]Different Summers Lyrics
[00:10.94]by Rui
[00:13.21]We're like a melody with no words
[00:17.01]Until we figure it out
[00:19.83]We sing  La, la, la, la, la, la
[00:25.28]I know it's smiple yeah but it's worked
[00:29.17]Right up til now its up to now yeah
[00:37.00]Every day has been like a dream world
[00:41.81]oh but now ur not just  in my head
[00:47.18]oh no
[00:48.61]Will we remember
[00:51.84]different summers
[00:54.95]It's like tossing your hearts to
[00:57.62]See where we land
[01:00.85]Heads is easy
[01:03.89]Tails is harder to plan
[01:09.98]If we're starting all over again
[01:13.69]And again and again
[01:18.01]
[01:19.41]You know that I can't help but wonder
[01:23.74]What's gonna happen next
[01:26.56]I'm a little curious, oh yeah
[01:32.07]Every star that I stood under
[01:35.81]When you were under it too
[01:38.44]Did you ever think about us'
[01:42.89]
[01:43.54]I hope you did, 'cause I can tell you
[01:49.18]That's something I'll never forget
[01:54.00]I won't forget
[01:55.61]If we remember
[01:58.47]Different summers
[01:58.60]It's like tossing your heart to
[02:04.81]See where we lands
[02:07.71]Heads is easy
[02:10.69]Tails is harder to plan
[02:16.79]If we're starting all over again
[02:22.58]Don't need friends
[02:25.21]Just beginning
[02:29.02]But i hope we will find it again
[02:34.20]So  again
[02:37.33]go from here oh
[02:44.53]Will we remember
[02:47.28]Different summers
[02:50.20]It's like tossing your hearts to
[02:53.30]See where we lands
[02:56.25]Heads is easy
[02:59.38]Tails is harder to plan
[03:05.48]If we're starting all over again
[03:15.29]Again and again and again and again
[03:20.64]Again and again and again
[03:26.64]Will we remember
[03:30.21]Different summers'
