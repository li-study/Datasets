[00:06.07]When I say it doesn't matter
[00:11.27]It matters most of all
[00:15.67]You're not up for conversation
[00:20.40]So I'm blinded by it all
[02:04.80][01:21.55][00:23.83]The further away you push me
[02:12.03][01:26.41][00:28.66]The closer I feel to you
[02:18.93][01:31.18][00:33.49]Every fall every crash
[02:21.14][01:33.15][00:35.51]Everything that was never meant to be
[02:26.68][01:38.58][00:41.02]All the perfect little things I could release
[02:29.87][01:41.61][00:44.04]All the nights every time
[02:31.84][01:43.92][00:46.35]we were just about to leave
[02:36.25][01:48.26][00:50.84]Now it makes no sense to me
[02:38.35][01:50.57][00:52.81]But it seems when we fall
[02:40.44][01:52.58][00:54.88]that's when we land perfectly
[02:45.72][01:57.21][00:59.44]
[01:04.03]Can't see what's before me
[01:08.94]Cannot feel the ground
[01:13.47]This place that we exist in
[01:18.19]Is the sweetest thing I found
[03:01.80][02:52.31]Perfectly
[03:06.52][02:55.37]
