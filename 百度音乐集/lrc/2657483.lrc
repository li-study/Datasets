[00:04.13]Phoenix
[00:06.04]
[00:19.36]Baby when I saw you turning at the end of the street
[00:25.69]I knew a time was gone and it took me like ages
[00:31.13]Just to understand that I was afraid to be a simple guy
[00:36.36]I tried my best to smile but deep inside my heart
[00:41.68]I felt it was shouting like a crowd dancing
[00:45.19]I guess I couldn't live without the things
[00:47.70]that made my life what it is
[00:50.89]Can't you hear me calling oh yeah
[00:57.85]Everybody's dancing
[01:04.28]Tonight everything is over
[01:07.57]I feel too young
[01:10.27]I can't lie on my bed without thinking I was wrong
[01:16.71]But when this feeling calls this world becomes another
[01:22.11]Nighttime won't hold me in your arms again
[01:26.88]I got a very good friend who says he can't believe the love I give
[01:33.12]Is not enough to end your fears
[01:36.31]I guess I couldn't live without the things
[01:39.23]that made my life what it is
[01:41.80]Can't you hear me calling oh yeah
[01:48.81]Everybody's dancing oh yeah
[01:55.26]Tonight everything is over
[01:58.64]I feel too young
[02:00.66]
[02:11.16]Oh rainfalls and hard times coming they won't leave me tonight
[02:17.82]I wish I knew what I was doing
[02:19.66]Just do let this spirit survive
[02:27.19]I guess I couldn't live without the things
[02:29.53]that made my life what it is
[02:33.03]Can't you hear me calling oh yeah
[02:39.91]Everybody's dancing oh yeah
[02:46.34]Tonight everything is over
[02:49.68]I feel too young
[02:53.43]Can't you hear me calling oh yeah
[03:00.16]Everybody's dancing oh yeah
[03:06.63]Tonight everything is over
[03:10.19]I feel too young
[03:13.55]Can't you hear me calling oh yeah
[03:15.73]
