[00:19.34]I don't understand your thinking
[00:21.43]I thought we were happy, guess I was mistaken
[00:23.84]Gave you all my love and my attention
[00:26.04]Say you don't want me
[00:27.54]Cuz something is missing
[00:28.71]Gave you all you wanted and you know it's true
[00:31.01]All that I was doin' meant nothing to you
[00:33.46]And if I told you why, we'd probably be cool
[00:35.69]But I was good to you, so good
[00:37.43]
[00:38.15]But you want a guy that's real nice
[00:39.60]That'll spend all his dough and his time
[00:41.83]But then you change your mind and want a thug guy
[00:43.78]Who won't act right
[00:45.00]It doesn't pay to be the good guy
[00:46.98]
