[00:17.45]Ain't no talkin to this man
[00:21.97]Ain't no pretty other side
[00:26.19]Ain't no way to understand the stupid words of pride
[00:35.30]It would take an acrobat, and I already tried all that so
[00:43.16]I'm gonna let him fly
[00:48.28]Things can move at such a pace
[00:55.80]The second hand just waved goodbye
[01:00.30]You know the light has left his face
[01:04.36]But you can't recall just where or why
[01:09.00]So there was really nothing to it
[01:12.77]I just went and cut right through it
[01:17.47]I said I'm gonna let him fly
[01:26.04]There's no mercy in a live wire
[01:30.58]No rest at all in freedom
[01:34.47]Of the choices we are given it's no choice at all
[01:43.37]The proof is in the fire
[01:47.24]You touch before it moves away
[01:58.36]But you must always know how long to stay and when to go
[02:06.49]And there ain't no talkin to this man
[02:10.31]He's been tryin to tell me so
[02:15.20]It took awhile to understand the beauty of just letting go
[02:19.06]Cause it would take an acrobat, I already tried all that
[02:31.22]I'm gonna let him fly
[02:38.47]I'm gonna let him fly
[02:47.08]I'm gonna let him fly
