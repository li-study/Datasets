[00:32.16]Sina,
[00:35.81]Have you never seen the dark side of a dreamer
[00:43.73]Won't you linger for a moment while I
[00:48.65]Search for the child behind your eyes
[00:53.87]I used to know?
[00:55.63]Who'd have thought it would take this to make you realize
[01:03.41]Who'd have dreamt it would be this that made you go
[01:08.93]
[01:12.25]Sina,
[01:14.70]Did you ever think that this would come between us
[01:22.01]Did I tell you that in spite of all
[01:28.02]I still see the sunrise in your hair
[01:30.75]And in your eyes?
[01:34.50]Did I tell you that you're still beyond compare
[01:41.49]Did I tell you that I'm sorry for the lies
[01:48.37]
[01:51.13]Like a galaxy that's a million miles away
[01:58.19]Another could never be the same
[02:05.82]Like a blind man with a thousand miles to go
[02:13.23]I'll still be calling out your name:
[02:19.89]
[02:21.77]Sina，
[02:24.30]If you've ever seen the dark side of a dreamer
[02:31.36]Then you'll understand my meaning when I
[02:38.15]Call to the child inside your heart
[02:41.91]I used to know
[02:44.00]And I ask you to remember how we started
[02:49.08]And I ask you to forget you want to go
[02:57.58]
[03:42.68]Sina,
[03:45.73]So at last you see the dark side of a dreamer.
[03:53.21]Won't you linger for a moment while I
[03:58.46]Search for the child behind your eyes
[04:03.02]I used to know?
[04:05.73]Who'd have thought it would take this to make you realize
[04:13.20]Who'd have dreamt it would be this that made you go
[04:19.26]
[04:51.77][04:35.37][04:20.74]So at last you’ve seen the dark side of a dreamer
[04:59.15][04:44.27][04:28.55]Who'd have dreamt it would be this that made you go
[05:07.93]
