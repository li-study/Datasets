[02:13.20][00:12.44]
[00:26.81]There was a boy...
[00:32.22]A very strange enchanted boy.
[00:37.91]They say he wandered very far, very far
[00:45.29]Over land and sea,
[00:52.81]A little shy and sad of eye
[01:03.08]But very wise was he.
[03:30.07][01:13.47]
[02:31.73][01:14.86]And then one day,
[02:35.31][01:18.57]One magic day, he passed my way.
[02:40.41][01:24.26]And while we spoke of many things,
[02:44.29][01:28.07]Fools and kings,
[02:47.44][01:31.65]This he said to me,
[02:54.20][01:39.16]"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
[03:05.94][01:49.87]Is just to love and be loved in return."
