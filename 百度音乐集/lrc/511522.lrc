[00:19.61]Though once you ruled my mind
[00:22.82]I thought you'd always be there
[00:29.61]And I'll always hold on to your face
[00:37.42]But everything changes in time
[00:40.49]And the answers are not always fair
[00:47.16]And I hope you've gone to a better place
[00:51.33]
[00:53.84]Cordell, time will tell
[00:58.23]They say that you passed away
[01:04.85]And I hope you've gone to a better place
[01:11.19]Time will tell, time will tell
[01:15.56]They say that you passed away
[01:22.61]And I know that you've gone to a better place
[01:26.72]
[01:29.23]Cordell, Cordell
[01:33.32]Cordell, Cordell
[01:38.38]Cordell, Cordell
[01:42.22]Cordell
[01:48.55]Your lover and baby will cry
[01:51.54]But your presence will always remain
[01:58.46]Is this how it was meant to be
[02:06.28]You meant something more to me
[02:09.41]Than what many people will see
[02:16.19]And to hell with the industry
[02:21.03]
[02:22.62]Cordell, time will tell
[02:26.75]They say that you passed away
[02:33.68]And I hope you've gone to a better place
[02:40.28]Time will tell, time will tell
[02:44.49]We all will depart and decay
[02:51.44]And we all will return to a better place
[02:55.95]
[02:58.02]Cordell, Cordell
[03:02.36]Cordell, Cordell
[03:07.08]Cordell, Cordell
[03:11.15]Cordell
[03:13.69]
[03:17.04]Nana, nana, nana, nana
[03:24.84]Nana, nana, nana, nana ......
