[00:01.00]BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
[00:07.00]Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson
[00:16.00]Tale as old as time, true as it can be.
[00:28.00]Barely even friends, then somebody bends, unexpectedly
[00:40.00]Just a little change, small to say the least, both a little scared,
[00:53.00]neither one prepared,
[00:56.00]BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
[01:02.00]Ever just the same, Ever a surprise
[01:14.00]Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise.
[01:30.00]INSTRUMENTAL
[01:52.00]Ever just the same,
[01:58.00]Ever a surprise
[02:04.00]Ever as before,
[02:07.00]and ever just as sure
[02:10.00]as the sun will rise.
[02:20.00]Tale as old as time, tune as old as song,
[02:32.00]Bitter sweet & strange,
[02:35.00]finding you can change, learning you were wrong
[02:44.00]Certain as the sun
[02:48.00](Certain as the sun),
[02:51.00]Rising in the east
[02:54.00]Tale as old as time,
[02:57.00]Song as old as rhyme, Beauty & the Beast
[03:06.00]Tale as old as time,
[03:09.00]Song as old as rhyme,
[03:13.00]BEAUTY...BEAST
