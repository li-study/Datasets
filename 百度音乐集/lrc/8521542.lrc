[00:00.96]Nobody's Fault But My Own-Beck
[00:08.25]
[00:18.18]Treated you like a rusty blade
[00:21.93]A throwaway from an open grave
[00:26.88]Cut you loose from a chain gang
[00:30.61]And let you go
[00:35.82]And on the day you said it's true
[00:39.45]Some love holds, some gets used
[00:44.64]Tried to tell you I never knew
[00:48.12]It could be so sweet
[00:53.86]Who could ever be so cruel,
[00:56.95]Blame the devil for the things you do
[01:06.22]Itâ€™s such a selfish way to lose
[01:10.00]The way you lose these wasted blues
[01:14.40]These wasted blues
[01:35.39][01:17.69]Tell me that it's nobody's fault
[01:38.45][01:20.97]Nobody's fault
[01:40.73][01:23.18]But my own
[01:44.06][01:26.52]That it's nobody's fault
[01:47.46][01:29.76]Nobody's fault
[01:49.41][01:31.96]But my own
[01:53.36]
[01:54.63]When the moon is a counterfeit
[01:58.31]Better find the one that fits
[02:03.31]Better find the one that lights
[02:06.98]The way for you
[02:12.35]When the road is full of nails,
[02:16.07]Garbage pails and darkened jails
[02:20.97]And their tongues
[02:22.54]Are full of heartless tales
[02:24.70]That drain on you
[02:30.43]Who would ever notice you
[02:33.50]You fade into a shaded room
[02:42.98]It's such a selfish way to lose
[02:46.92]The way you lose these wasted blues
[02:51.12]These wasted blues
[02:54.52]Tell me that it's nobody's fault
[02:57.82]Nobody's fault But my own
[03:03.34]Tell me that it's nobody's fault
[03:06.72]Nobody's fault
[03:09.06]But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
[03:15.45]Nobody's fault
[03:17.74]But my own tell me that it's nobody's fault
[03:24.26]Nobody's fault
[03:26.45]But my own
[04:05.83]Tell me that it's nobody's fault
[04:08.99]Nobody's fault
[04:20.13][04:11.25]But my own
[04:14.66]Tell me that it's nobody's fault
[04:17.94]Nobody's fault
