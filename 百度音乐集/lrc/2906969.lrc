[00:17.00]
[00:17.76]I'm out on my own again
[00:22.40]Face down in the porcelain
[00:28.03]Feeling so high but looking so low
[00:38.46]Party favors on the floor
[00:43.78]Group of girls banging on the door
[00:49.57]So many new fair-weather friends oooâ€¦
[01:00.38]
[01:01.05]Have you ever been so lost
[01:12.05]Known the way and still so lost
[01:21.19]
[01:23.72]Caught in the eye of a hurricane
[01:28.30]Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
[01:34.71]So sick of this town pulling me down
[01:41.12]
[01:44.90]My mother says I should come back home but
[01:49.86]Can't find the way cause the way is gone
[01:55.17]So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space
[02:07.15]
[02:07.65]Have you ever been so lost
[02:18.31]Known the way and still so lost
[02:29.92]Another night waiting for someone to take me home
[02:40.10]Have you ever been so lost
[02:47.67]
[02:48.28]Is there a light
[02:50.10]Is there a light
[02:53.01]At the end of the road
[02:58.25]I'm pushing everyone away
[03:01.01]'Cause I can't feel this anymore
[03:04.53]Can't feel this anymore
[03:07.49]
[03:07.96]Have you ever been so lost
[03:17.60]Known the way and still so lost
[03:29.61]Another night waiting for someone to take me home
[03:38.30]Have you ever been so lost
[03:48.71]Have you ever been so LOST.
