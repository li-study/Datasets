[00:00.00]S Club 7 － Never Had A Dream Come Ture
[00:00.01]
[00:01.02]第一次做的歌词——献给我深深爱着的Lu
[00:04.02]
[00:04.50]愿你天天开心！表再哭鼻子了～
[00:08.03]
[00:08.68]Ooh...
[00:09.68]
[00:18.27]Everybody's got something they had to leave behind
[00:25.92]One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time
[00:32.83]There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
[00:36.68]How it could be now or neither been (or neither been)
[00:40.66]All this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go
[00:47.51]
[00:47.72]I never had a dream come true
[00:51.77]Till that day that I found you
[00:55.61]Even though I pretend that I've moved on
[01:00.26]You'll always be my baby
[01:03.40]I never found the words to say
[01:07.27]You're the one I think about each day
[01:11.20]And I know no matter where love takes me to
[01:15.88]A part of me will always be with you
[01:24.20]
[01:28.46]Somewhere in my memory I lost all sense of time
[01:36.24]And tomorrow can never be
[01:39.04]'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
[01:43.26]There's no use looking back or wondering
[01:46.61]How it should be now or neither been (or neither been)
[01:51.08]Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go
[02:00.07]
[02:00.20]I never had a dream come true
[02:03.59]Till that day that I found you
[02:07.86]Even though I pretend that I've moved on
[02:12.53]You'll always be my baby
[02:15.57]I never found the words to say
[02:19.54]You're the one I think about each day
[02:23.43]And I know no matter where love takes me to
[02:28.19]A part of me will always be with you
[02:33.00]
[02:33.20]You'll always be the dream that fills my head
[02:36.87](Yes you will, say you will, you know you will, baby)
[02:41.04]You'll always be the one I know (I'll never forget)
[02:47.75]There's no use looking back or wondering (or wondering)
[02:51.31]Because love is a strange and funny thing
[02:55.22]No matter how I try and try
[02:59.54]I just can't say goodbye
[03:04.43]
[03:04.64]No no no no
[03:06.00]
[03:06.30]I never had a dream come true
[03:10.25]Till that day that I found you
[03:14.19]Even though I pretend that I've moved on
[03:18.82]You'll always be my baby
[03:22.00]I never found the words to say
[03:25.94]You're the one I think about each day
[03:29.69]And I know no matter where love takes me to
[03:34.43]A part of me will always be with you
[03:38.71]A part of me will always be with you...
[03:47.07]
[03:49.28]Ooh...
[03:53.71]
[03:54.28]End
