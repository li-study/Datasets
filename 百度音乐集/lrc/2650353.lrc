[00:23.12]Look around wonder why
[00:28.48]we can live a life that's never satisfied
[00:33.47]Lonely hearts troubled minds
[00:39.76]looking for a way that we can never find
[00:44.01]Many roads are ahead of us
[00:48.45]with choices to be made
[00:53.07]But life's just one of the games we play
[00:59.17]There is no special way
[01:03.61]Make the best of what's given you
[01:08.97]everything will come in time
[01:13.96]why deny yourself
[01:20.23]don't just let life pass you by
[01:24.60]like winter in July
[01:29.71]
[01:37.83]Future dreams can never last
[01:43.46]when you find yourself still living in the past
[01:48.45]Keep moving on to higher ground
[01:53.63]looking for the way
[01:56.19]you thought could not be found
[01:59.18]We may not know the reason why
[02:03.61]we're born into this world
[02:07.87]where a man only lives to die
[02:14.15]his story left untold
[02:18.77]Make the best of what's given you
[02:23.77]everything will come in time
[02:28.76]why deny yourself
[02:34.84]don't just let life pass you by
[02:39.28]like winter in July
[02:44.80]
[03:12.36]We may not know the reason why
[03:18.09]we're born into this world
[03:23.45]where a man only lives to die
[03:28.26]his story left untold
[03:33.38]Make the best of what's given you
[03:38.93]everything will come in time
[03:43.55]why deny yourself
[03:49.10]don't just let life pass you by
[03:53.91]like winter in July
