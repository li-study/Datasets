[00:39.84]When we were young the futurewas so bright
[00:41.88]the old neighbourhood was so alive
[00:44.42]and every kid on the whole damn street
[00:46.69]was gonna make it big and not be beat
[00:49.06]
[00:49.69]now the neighbourhood's cracked and torn
[00:51.91]the kids are grown up
[00:53.04]but their lives are worn
[00:54.38]how can one little street
[00:56.29]swallow so many lives
[00:57.87]
[00:58.36]chances thrown
[01:00.56]nothing's free
[01:02.38]longing for what used to be
[01:07.77]still it's hard
[01:10.14]hard to see
[01:12.49]fragile lives, shattered dreams

[01:41.60]Mark still lives at home
[01:43.32]cause he's got no job

[01:51.65]What the hell is going on
[01:54.37]the cruellest dream, reality
[01:56.18]chances thrown
[01:58.12]nothing's free
[02:00.46]longing for what used to be
[02:05.31]still it's hard
[02:07.69]hard to see
[02:10.20]fragile lives, shattered dreams
[02:15.53]
[02:34.29]chances thrown
[02:36.77]nothing's free
[02:39.20]longing for what used to be
