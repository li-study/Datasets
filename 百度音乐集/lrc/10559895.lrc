[00:01.40]I Turn To You
[00:03.38]Christina Aguilera
[00:05.48]
[00:28.74]When I'm lost in the rain,
[00:37.05]In your eyes I know I'll find the light
[00:41.28]To light my way.
[00:44.44]when I'm scared,
[00:47.95]losing ground,
[00:51.71]When my world is going crazy,
[00:55.67]You can turn it all around.
[01:00.85]And when I'm down you're there
[01:04.22]pushing me to the top
[01:08.34]You're always there,
[01:10.54]giving me all you've got.
[01:14.65]For a shield from the storm,
[01:18.42]For a friend, for a love
[01:21.81]to keep me safe and warm
[01:26.35]I turn to you.
[01:29.88]For the strength to be strong,
[01:33.39]For the will to carry on
[01:38.04]For everything you do,
[01:41.73]for everything that's true
[01:44.51]I turn to you.
[01:47.94]
[01:52.20]When I lose the will to win,
[02:00.17]I just reach for you and
[02:03.03]I can reach the sky again.
[02:07.37]I can do anything
[02:14.95]Cause your love is so amazing,
[02:18.80]Cause your love inspires me.
[02:24.05]And when I need a friend,
[02:27.18]You're always on my side
[02:31.44]Giving me faith
[02:33.37]that gets me through the night.
[02:37.57]For a shield from the storm,
[02:41.35]For a friend, for a love
[02:44.83]to keep me safe and warm
[02:47.74]
[02:49.66]I turn to you.
[02:52.90]For the strength to be strong,
[02:56.48]For the will to carry on
[03:03.03]For everything you do,
[03:05.77]I turn to you.
[03:11.58]For the arms to be my shelter
[03:15.17]through all the rain,
[03:17.74]For truth that will never change,
[03:21.59]For someone to lean on,
[03:26.72]For a heart I can rely on through anything,
[03:32.70]For that one who I can run to...
[03:41.74]For a shield from the storm,
[03:45.40]For a friend, for a love
[03:49.17]to keep me safe and warm
[03:53.40]I turn to you.
[03:56.29]
[03:56.86]For the strength to be strong,
[04:00.38]For the will to carry on
[04:05.10]For everything you do,
[04:08.45]for everything that's true
[04:11.46]For everything you do,
[04:16.14]for everything that's true
[04:18.93]I turn to you.
