[00:00.00]Perhaps Love
[00:01.44]
[00:04.09]Perhaps love is like a resting place
[00:07.92]A shelter from the storm
[00:10.38]It exists to give you comfort
[00:12.92]It is there to keep you warm
[00:15.77]And in those times of trouble
[00:18.70]When you are most alone
[00:21.31]The memory of love will bring you home
[00:26.68]
[00:27.56]Perhaps love is like a window
[00:30.50]Perhaps an open door
[00:33.24]It invites you to come closer
[00:36.13]It wants to show you more
[00:38.79]And even if you lose yourself
[00:41.63]And don't know what to do
[00:44.24]The memory of love will see you through
[00:49.16]
[00:49.76]Oh, love to some is like a cloud
[00:52.59]To some as strong as steel
[00:55.34]For some a way of living
[00:58.05]For some a way to feel
[01:00.85]And some say love is holding on
[01:03.81]And some say letting go
[01:06.66]And some say love is everything
[01:09.43]And some say they don't know
[01:14.26]Perhaps love is like the ocean
[01:17.08]Full of conflict, full of change
[01:20.01]Like a fire when it's cold outside
[01:22.98]Or thunder when it rains
[01:25.28]
[01:25.67]If I should live forever
[01:28.65]And all my dreams come true
[01:31.40]My memories of love will be of you
[01:37.11]
[01:49.61]And some say love is holding on
[01:52.44]And some say letting go
[01:55.20]And some say love is everything
[01:57.96]And some say they don't know
[02:03.19]Perhaps love is like the ocean
[02:06.49]Full of conflict, full of change
[02:09.33]Like a fire when it's cold outside
[02:12.30]Or thunder when it rains
[02:14.74]
[02:15.13]If I should live forever
[02:18.10]And all my dreams come true
[02:21.11]My memories of love will be of you
[02:28.80]
