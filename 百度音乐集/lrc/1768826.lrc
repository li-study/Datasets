[00:00.00]Nightwish - Wish I Had an Angel
[00:00.01]
[00:00.02]I wish I had an angel
[00:02.88]For one moment of love
[00:06.05]I wish I had your angel tonight
[00:12.65]
[00:22.01]Deep into a dying day
[00:27.86]I took a step outside an innocent heart
[00:34.17]Prepare to hate me fall when I may
[00:39.99]This night will hurt you like never before
[00:46.54]Old loves they die hard
[00:52.51]Old lies they die harder
[00:57.80]I wish I had an angel
[01:00.47]For one moment of love
[01:03.58]I wish I had your angel
[01:06.55]Your Virgin Mary undone
[01:09.58]I'm in love with my lust
[01:12.53]Burning angelwings to dust
[01:15.63]I wish I had your angel tonight
[01:22.00]I`m going down so frail and cruel
[01:28.32]Drunken disguise changes all the rules
[01:34.15]Old loves they die hard
[01:40.21]Old lies they die harder
[01:45.67]I wish I had an angel
[01:48.70]For one moment of love
[01:51.86]I wish I had your angel
[01:54.83]Your Virgin Mary undone
[01:57.85]I'm in love with my lust
[02:00.82]Burning angelwings to dust
[02:03.82]I wish I had your angel tonight
[02:10.22]
[02:25.77]Greatest thrill
[02:27.30]Not to kill
[02:28.73]But to have the prize of the night
[02:31.89]Hypocrite
[02:33.35]Wannabe friend
[02:35.01]13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
[02:38.05]Last dance, first kiss
[02:40.91]Your touch my bliss
[02:43.95]Beauty always comes with dark thoughts
[02:50.64]
[03:14.67]I wish I had an angel
[03:17.68]For one moment of love
[03:20.88]I wish I had your angel
[03:23.80]Your Virgin Mary undone
[03:26.87]I'm in love with my lust
[03:29.81]Burning angelwings to dust
[03:32.81]I wish I had your angel tonight
[03:39.09]
[03:48.00]I wish I had an angel
[03:50.97]I wish I had an angel
