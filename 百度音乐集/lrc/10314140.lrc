[00:00.02]If I should die this very moment
[00:06.78]I wouldn\'t fear
[00:10.90]For I\'ve never known completeness
[00:15.62]Like being here
[00:18.25]Wrapped in the warmth of you
[00:23.41]Loving every breath of you
[00:28.32]Still my heart this moment
[00:31.87]Or it might burst
[00:37.95]Could we stay right here
[00:41.05]Until the end of time
[00:43.01]\'Til the earth stops turning
[00:46.79]Wanna love you \'til the seas run dry
[00:53.38]I\'ve found the one I\'ve waited for
[01:13.49]All this time I\'ve loved you
[01:18.03]And never known your face
[01:22.74]All this time I\'ve missed you
[01:26.90]And searched this human race
[01:31.69]Here is true peace
[01:36.17]Here my heart most calm
[01:41.44]Safe in your soul
[01:46.07]Bathed in your sighs
[01:51.84]Wanna stay right here
[01:55.02]Until the end of time
[01:56.97]\'Til the earth stops turning
[02:00.97]Gonna love you \'til the seas runs run dry
[02:07.19]I\'ve found the one I\'ve waited for
[02:45.85]All I\'ve known,
[02:47.61]All I\'ve done,
[02:49.14]All I\'ve felt,
[02:50.83]Was leading to this
[02:54.72]All I\'ve known,
[02:56.44]All I\'ve done,
[02:58.10]All I\'ve felt,
[02:59.81]Was leading to this
[03:04.37]Wanna stay right here
[03:07.27]Until the end of time
[03:09.34]\'Til the earth stops turning
[03:13.33]Gonna love you \'til the seas run dry
[03:19.50]I\'ve found the one I\'ve waited for
[03:30.44]The one I\'ve waited for
[04:17.76]Wanna stay right here
[04:20.58]Until the end of time
[04:22.69]\'Til the earth stops turning
[04:26.80]Gonna love you \'til the seas run dry
[04:32.66]I\'ve found the one I\'ve waited for
