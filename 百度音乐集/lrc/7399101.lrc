[00:19.17]Ohooooo
[00:33.72]A father waits upon a son
[00:37.88]A mother prays for his return
[00:41.99]I just called to see
[00:44.14]If you still have a place for me
[00:48.04]We know that like took us apart
[00:52.54]But you're still within my heart
[00:56.39]I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me
[01:03.05]I'll make it home again
[01:06.06]I pray you'll fall in love again
[01:10.07]Just say you'll entertain the possibility
[01:17.57]I learned enough from my mistakes
[01:20.83]Learned from all I didn't say
[01:26.34]Won't you wait for me
[01:31.81]
[01:32.71]It may be long to get me there
[01:36.03]It feels like I've been everywhere
[01:40.15]But someday I'll be coming home
[01:46.48]Round and round the world will spin
[01:50.61]Oh, the circle never ends
[01:55.52]So you know that I'll be coming home
[02:00.58]
[02:02.15]We fight to stay alive
[02:06.94]But somebody's got to die
[02:10.74]It's so strange to me
[02:13.16]A new year, a new enemy
[02:17.16]Another soldier gone to war
[02:21.21]Another story told before
[02:25.09]Now it's told again
[02:27.57]It seems the wars will never end
[02:31.68]But we'll make it home again
[02:34.51]Back where we belong again
[02:38.78]We're holding on to when
[02:42.25]We used to dare to dream
[02:46.40]We pray we live to see
[02:49.66]Another day in history
[02:54.01]Yes we still believe
[02:59.97]
[03:01.13]It may be long to get me there
[03:04.63]It feels like I've been everywhere
[03:09.12]But someday I'll be coming home
[03:15.60]Round and round the world will spin
[03:19.19]Oh, the circle never ends
[03:23.56]So you know that I'll be coming home
[03:29.42]
[03:29.79]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming?
[03:42.18]You know that I'll be coming home
[03:47.20]
[04:29.38]It may be long to get me there
[04:33.14]It feels like I've been everywhere
[04:37.52]But someday I'll be coming home
[04:43.67]Round and round the world will spin
[04:47.89]Oh, the circle never ends
[04:52.11]So you know that I'll be coming home
