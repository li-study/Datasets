[00:00.00]Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem
[00:06.10]How still we see thee lie;
[00:11.42]Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
[00:17.27]The silent stars go by;
[00:22.93]Yet in thy dark streets shineth
[00:28.47]The everlasting light.
[00:33.98]The hopes and fears of all the years
[00:39.63]Are met in thee tonight.
[00:46.08]
[00:56.47]For Christ is born of Mary,
[01:02.00]And gathered all above,
[01:07.50]While mortals sleep the angels keep
[01:12.81]Their watch of wondering love.
[01:18.34]O morning stars, together
[01:24.24]Proclaim the holy birth !
[01:29.49]And praises sing to God the King,
[01:35.51]And peace to men on earth !
[01:40.17]
[01:52.21]How silently, how silently
[01:58.02]The wondrous gift is given !
[02:02.95]So God imparts to human hearts
[02:09.09]The blessings of His heaven.
[02:14.25]No ear may hear His coming;
[02:20.24]But in this world of sin,
[02:25.33]Where meek souls will receive Him still,
[02:31.65]The dear Christ enters in.
[02:35.73]
[02:47.75]O holy Child of Bethlehem,
[02:53.64]Descend to us, we pray;
[02:58.72]Cast out our sin and enter in,
[03:04.53]Be born in us today.
[03:10.09]We hear the Christmas angels
[03:16.00]The great glad tidings tell,
[03:21.41]O come to us, abide with us,
[03:27.30]Out Lord Emmanuel !
[03:32.27]O come to us, abide with us,
[03:38.12]Out Lord Emmanuel !
[03:43.68]
