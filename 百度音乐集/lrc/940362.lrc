[03:23.46][00:17.89]In this time.
[03:26.03][00:20.81]I am not the lonely one.
[03:29.69][00:24.55]You are always in my mind.
[03:34.11][00:28.92]So I am looking，waiting，
[03:36.48][00:31.20]for the sunrise.
[03:38.70][00:33.47]In this time.
[03:41.53][00:36.12]I can feel the love inside.
[03:45.23][00:40.03]I know you can understand.
[03:49.49][00:44.24]So I want you，need you，
[03:51.96][00:46.59]back into my life.
[00:52.54][02:34.50]
[02:36.70][01:04.09]随寂寞远行
[02:40.25][01:07.42]世界是如此安静
[02:44.07][01:11.10]心情停留在雨季
[02:47.10][01:14.24]思念不停
[02:50.34][01:17.10]
[02:52.08][01:19.49]车窗外风景
[02:55.70][01:22.82]不断映入我眼底
[02:59.50][01:26.68]仿佛一幕幕回忆
[03:02.45][01:29.59]漫无边际
[03:05.13][01:33.24]
[03:06.82][01:33.95]你看那天边
[03:10.16][01:37.35]夕阳缓缓睡去
[03:14.14][01:41.11]暮色轻轻拥抱着大地
[03:18.76][01:46.35]河流漫步山野多轻盈
[01:49.62]你听那远处
[01:53.13]牧歌阵阵轻送
[01:57.02]泥土尽情吐露着芬芳
[02:01.75]时光不禁驻留在身旁
[04:03.91]
[04:19.33]Bye-bye!
