[00:59.76][00:14.36][00:00.05]Oh my Jolie Blonde
[00:03.30]You've gone so far away
[00:06.91]From the southern home
[00:09.32]Where you were born
[00:10.72]My lovely Jolie Blonde
[00:17.56]The skies they turned to grey
[00:21.02]And lonely seas
[00:23.05]Swept you from me
[00:38.87][00:24.77]My love, my Jolie Blonde
[00:28.70]The lord he aclmed
[00:30.22]The Ponchartrain
[00:31.94]Stilled the winds
[00:33.65]And dried the rain
[00:35.35]But he stole you girl
[00:37.07]From New Orleans
[01:03.56]Here by the shore I'll wait
[01:07.07]For death to come
[01:09.14]And lead me on
[01:10.81]To you my Jolie Blonde
