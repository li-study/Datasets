[00:04.93]
[00:13.88]Seconds hours so many days
[00:17.19]You know what you want but how long can you wait
[00:21.56]Every moment last forever
[00:24.83]When you feel you've lost your way
[00:27.46]What if your chances are already gone
[00:30.84]Started believing that I could be wrong
[00:35.10]But you give me one good reason
[00:38.37]To fight and never walk away
[00:40.96]Coz here I am  still holding on!
[00:47.90]With every step you climb another mountain
[00:51.17]Every breathe its harder to believe
[00:54.95]You'll make it through the pain
[00:56.31]Weather the hurricanes
[00:59.52]To get to that on thing
[01:01.55]Just when you think the road is going nowhere
[01:05.00]Just when you're almost gave up on your dreams
[01:08.51]They take you by the hand
[01:10.05]And show you that you can
[01:12.75]There are no boundaries
[01:20.02]There are no boundaries
[01:26.89]
[01:28.43]I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
[01:31.89]What if today as good as it gets
[01:35.95]Don't know where the future's heading
[01:38.96]But nothing's gonna bring me down
[01:42.06]I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
[01:45.26]I've rished being safe but I always knew why
[01:50.29]I always knew why
[01:53.49]So here I am  still holding on!
[02:01.00]With every step you climb another mountain
[02:04.31]Every breathe it's harder to believe
[02:07.73]You'll make it through the pain
[02:09.33]Weather the hurricanes
[02:12.36]To get to that one things
[02:14.50]Just when you think the road is gong nowhere
[02:17.77]Just when you're almost gave up on your dreams
[02:21.25]They take you by the hand
[02:22.71]And show you that you can
[02:26.85]You can go higher
[02:28.58]You can go deeper
[02:30.23]There are no boundaries
[02:31.97]Above and beneath you
[02:33.71]Break every rule cause there's nothing between you
[02:37.31]And your dreams
[02:41.54]With every step you climb another mountain
[02:44.92]Every breath it's harder to believe
[02:48.31]You'll make ir through the pain
[02:49.92]Wheather the hurricanes
