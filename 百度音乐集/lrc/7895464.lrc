[00:00.00]Bells For Her
[00:05.26]
[00:41.67]And through the life force and there goes her friend
[00:49.27]On her Nishiki it's out of time
[00:56.77]And through the portal they can make amends
[01:03.30]
[01:04.25]Hey would you say whatever we're blanket friends
[01:34.89][01:13.75]Can't stop what's coming
[01:37.26][01:24.22]Can't stop what's on its way
[01:45.51]
[01:45.62]And through the walls they made their mudpies
[01:52.94]I've got your mind I said
[01:55.47]She said I've your voice
[02:00.47]I said you don't need my voice girl
[02:03.66]You have your own
[02:06.85]But you never thought it was enough of
[02:15.00]So they went years and years
[02:23.57]Like sisters blanket girls
[02:29.71]Always there through that and this
[02:37.37]There's nothing we cannot ever fix I said
[02:39.07]
[03:07.37][02:45.59]Can't stop what's coming
[03:08.93][02:55.72]Can't stop what's on its way
[04:57.07][04:35.39]Can't stop what's coming
[05:02.19][04:45.79]Can't stop what's on its way
[03:57.52]And now I speak to you are you in there
[04:04.90]You have her face and her eyes
[04:08.36]But you are not her
[04:13.35]And we go at each other like blank ettes
[04:21.56]Who can't find their thread and their bare
[04:26.14]
[05:06.26]Can't stop loving
[05:16.59]And I see it coming
[05:21.18]And it's on its way
