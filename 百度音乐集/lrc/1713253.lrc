[00:01.66]The Weakness In Me
[00:04.23]
[00:06.64]Joan Armatrading
[00:08.62]
[00:09.80]I'm not the sort of person
[00:12.95]Who falls
[00:15.56]In and quickly out of love
[00:19.65]But to you I gave my affection
[00:24.08]Right from the start
[00:27.70]
[00:29.01]I have a lover
[00:31.64]Who loves me
[00:34.39]How could I break such a heart
[00:38.75]Yet still you get my attention
[00:44.05]
[00:47.03]Why do you come here
[00:50.51]When you know I've got trouble enough
[00:53.98]Why do you call me
[00:57.63]When you know I can't answer the phone
[01:00.97]
[01:01.63]Make me lie
[01:04.33]When I don't want to
[01:06.11]And make someone else
[01:07.76]Some kind of an unknowing fool
[01:10.77]You make me stay
[01:13.65]When I should not
[01:15.58]Are you so strong
[01:17.22]Or is all the weakness in me
[01:19.49]
[01:19.93]Why do you come here
[01:23.40]And pretend to be just passing by
[01:27.64]When I mean to see you
[01:32.37]And I mean to hold you
[01:35.81]Tightly
[01:42.68]
[01:46.82]Feeling guilty
[01:49.76]Worried
[01:52.14]Waking from tormented sleep
[01:56.59]This old love has me bound
[02:00.40]But the new love cuts deep
[02:05.56]
[02:05.77]If I choose now
[02:08.34]I'll lose out
[02:10.98]One of you has to fall
[02:15.10]And I need you
[02:17.72]And you
[02:21.83]
[02:23.53]Why do you come here
[02:27.07]When you know I've got trouble enough
[02:30.86]Why do you call me
[02:34.20]When you know I can't answer the phone
[02:37.27]
[02:38.21]Make me lie
[02:40.97]When I don't want to
[02:42.85]And make someone else
[02:44.42]Some kind of an unknowing fool
[02:47.44]You make me stay
[02:50.34]When I should not
[02:52.01]Are you so strong
[02:53.74]Or is all the weakness in me
[02:55.69]
[02:56.43]Why do you come here
[03:00.05]And pretend to be just passing by
[03:04.18]When I mean to see you
[03:08.91]And I mean to hold you
[03:12.60]Tightly
