[00:15.37]Starry nights city lights
[00:20.64]Coming down over me
[00:24.43]Skyscrapers and stargazers
[00:29.04]In my head
[00:33.60]Are we we are, Are we we are
[00:37.95]The waiting unknown
[00:41.58]This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
[00:47.73]Lost and found city bound in my dreams
[00:56.49]And screaming
[00:59.52]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[01:05.80]And screaming
[01:08.23]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[01:14.21]Forget me nots and second thoughts
[01:20.46]Live in isolation
[01:24.34]Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
[01:30.88]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting unknown
[01:40.92]The rage and love, the story of my life
[01:48.68]The Jesus of suburbia is a lie
[01:55.95]And screaming
[01:59.65]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[02:05.48]And screaming
[02:08.14]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[02:15.36]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[02:22.81]And screaming
[02:25.35]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[02:32.00]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
[02:41.99]Are we we are, Are we we are the waiting
