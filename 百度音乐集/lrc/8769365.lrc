[00:21.03]We've known each other
[00:23.25]For a long long time
[00:25.30]But I never really noticed
[00:27.83]All the magic in your eyes
[00:30.36]I've been around you
[00:32.19]A thousand times before
[00:34.44]And you've always been a friend to me
[00:36.82]But now I'm wanting more
[00:39.82]I must have been so blind
[00:41.91]I never realized
[00:44.23]You're the one that's right for me
[00:46.17]All the while I couldn't see
[00:49.36]And now I feel so strange
[00:51.02]I'll never be the same
[00:53.17]I'm going 'round and 'round in circles

[01:25.98]How I feel inside
[01:28.06]I'm going through a transformation
[01:30.63]That's so hard for me to hide
[01:33.39]I had a revelation
[01:35.30]That finally opened up my eyes
[01:37.35]The one I spent a lifetime searching for
[01:39.75]Was right here all the time
[01:42.67]I was oblivious
[01:44.75]So very out of touch
[01:46.99]All the while I couldn't see
[01:49.30]You're the one that's right for me
[01:51.90]And now my world has changed
[01:54.15]I'll never be the same
[01:56.11]Going 'round and 'round in circles
[01:58.83]And it
