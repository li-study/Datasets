[00:25.50][02:24.50]My name is Luka
[00:28.50][02:28.50]I live on the second floor
[00:32.50][02:31.50]I live upstairs from you
[00:36.50][02:35.50]Yes I think you've seen me before
[00:40.50][02:39.50]If you hear something late at night
[00:44.50][02:43.50]Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
[00:48.50][00:52.50][00:55.50][02:47.50][02:51.50][02:54.50]Just don't ask me what it was
[01:00.50]I think it's because I'm clumsy
[01:03.50]I try not to talk too loud
[01:07.50]Maybe it's because I'm crazy
[01:11.50]I try not to act too proud
[01:15.50][02:59.50]They only hit until you cry
[01:18.50][03:02.50]And after that you don't ask why
[01:22.50][01:26.50][01:30.50][03:06.50][03:10.50][03:14.50]You just don't argue anymore
[01:50.50]Yes I think I'm okay
[01:53.50]I walked into the door again
[01:57.50]Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
[02:01.50]And it's not your business anyway
[02:04.50]I guess I'd like to be alone
[02:08.50]With nothing broken, nothing thrown
[02:12.50][02:16.50][02:20.50]Just don't ask me how I am
