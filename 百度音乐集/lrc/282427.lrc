[00:07.61]Does it make you sad when you pack your bags and go
[00:14.35]Somewhere far away far away
[00:20.95]
[00:25.90]Does nostalgia grow along the way
[00:32.82]Seeing your house behind for behind
[00:39.50]
[00:44.22]Your heart by now must grow fond
[00:51.18]Of the new things to come
[00:57.03]
[01:06.23]Looking out the plane you wish that he was here
[01:13.20]Right by your side oh ain't that nice
[01:19.80]
[01:24.49]You think it would be nice to make love
[01:31.41]Above the dark clouds oh ain't that nice
[01:37.42]
[01:42.80]Your heart by now is filled
[01:49.80]With a feeling you can't explain
[01:55.80]
[02:04.90]Does it make you sad when you pack your  bags and go
[02:10.74]
[02:11.96]Does it make you sad when you pack your  bags and go
[02:19.36]Does it make you sad when you pack your  bags and go
[02:28.56]
[02:37.80]Oh
[02:47.39]Goodbye goodbye
[02:49.52]So long so long
