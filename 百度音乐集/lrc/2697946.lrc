[00:36.65]Moving just keep moving
[00:43.36]Well I don’t know why to stay
[00:55.84]No ties to bind me
[01:00.89]No reasons to remain
[01:11.31]Got a low low feeling around me
[01:15.49]And a stone cold feeling inside
[01:19.74]And I just can’t stop messing my mind up
[01:23.94]Or wasting my time
[01:28.46]There’s a mow low feeling around me
[01:32.61]And a stone cold feeling inside
[01:36.94]I’ve got to find somebody to help me

[01:45.63]So I’ll keep moving just keep moving
[01:52.99]Well I don’t know who I am
[02:05.31]No need to follow
[02:10.03]There’s no way back again
[02:21.01]Moving keep on moving
[02:27.57]Where I feel I’m home again
[02:39.81]And when it’s over
[02:44.68]I’ll see you again
[02:59.35]Got a low low feeling around me
[03:03.62]And a stone cold feeling inside
[03:07.93]And I just can’t stop messing my mind up
[03:11.70]Or wasting my time
