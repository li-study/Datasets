[00:09.85]Like a roamer, roamer
[00:13.54]Hello, I'm coming at your town again
[00:19.30]How's about a night, how's about a flight supernova
[00:25.83]I know I've been kinda hot and cold
[00:31.65]But you never go away, no matter what I say
[00:34.93]In the mornings
[00:37.24]My need is running low
[00:40.49]I've been moving everywhere
[00:43.98]Spreading out my wings, trying everything
[00:47.13]But that's over, cos when I'm on my own
[00:52.98]Waking up with someone new
[00:56.67]And now I feel the same, I'm mixing up their name
[00:59.70]It's like a roamer
[01:03.69]Goodbye, I'm going on the road again
[01:09.09]But I'm bringing you along
[01:11.05]In each and every song that we cover
[01:15.98]And I, I always wanna see your face
[01:22.12]Cos looking in your eyes, is where I see my life
[01:25.07]When I'm older
[01:27.49]My need is running low
[01:30.72]I've been moving everywhere
[01:34.28]Spreading out my wings, trying everything
[01:37.36]But that's over, cos when I'm on my own
[01:43.27]Waking up with someone new
[01:46.81]And now I feel the same, I'm mixing up their name
[01:50.02]It's like a roamer
[01:53.32]Like a roamer, like a roamer
[02:00.05]Mississippi, Tenessee, Argentina ever seen
[02:02.90]California, Mexico, like a roamer
[02:06.10]Russia, San Francisco Bay, to the UK
[02:09.20]Round the world in 80 days
[02:11.36]Like a roamer
[02:13.14]
[02:24.72]When I go away, don't wanna go away
[02:27.68]Don't wanna go away, don't wanna go away
[02:30.78]Don't wanna go away, don't wanna go away
[02:30.82]Don't wanna go away, don't wanna go away
[02:36.61]My need is running low
[02:39.81]I've been moving everywhere
