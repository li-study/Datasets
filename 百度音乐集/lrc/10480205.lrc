[00:16.36]Finding the world in the smallness of a grain of sand
[00:24.44]And holding infinities in the palm of your hand
[00:33.48]And Heaven's realms in the seedlings of this tiny flower
[00:42.49]And eternities in the space of a single hour
[00:50.46]Send your love into the future
[00:59.00]Send your love into the distant dawn
[01:12.90]Inside your mind is a relay station
[01:15.21]A mission probe into the unknowing
[01:17.31]We send a seed to a distant future
[01:19.51]Then we can watch the galaxies growing
[01:21.61]This ain't no time for doubting your power
[01:23.71]This ain't no time for hiding your care
[01:25.90]You're climbing down from an ivory tower
[01:27.93]You've got a stake in the world we ought to share
[01:30.29]You see the stars are moving so slowly
[01:32.13]But still the earth is moving so fast
[01:34.46]Can't you see the moon is so lonely
[01:36.47]She's still trapped in the pain of the past
[01:38.69]This is the time of the worlds colliding
[01:40.28]This is the time of kingdoms falling
[01:42.87]This is the time of the worlds dividing
[01:44.92]Time to heed your call
[01:46.48]Send your love into the future
[01:54.71]Send your precious love into some distant time
[02:02.66]And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing
[02:11.78]Send your love
[02:15.67]Send your love
[02:34.89]There's no religion but sex and music
[02:36.44]There's no religion but sound and dancing
[02:38.55]There's no religion but line and color
[02:40.64]There's no religion but sacred trance
[02:42.79]There's no religion but the endless ocean
[02:44.83]There's no religion but the moon and stars
[02:47.04]There's no religion but time and motion
[02:49.23]There's no religion, just tribal scars
[02:51.34]Throw a pebble in and watch the ocean
[02:53.49]See the ripples vanish in the distance
[02:55.61]It's just the same with all the emotions
[02:57.77]It's just the same in every instance
[03:00.01]There's no religion but the joys of rhythm
[03:02.02]There's no religion but the rites of Spring
[03:04.14]There's no religion in the path of hate
[03:06.50]No prayer but the one I sing
[03:07.77]Send your love into the future
[03:16.46]Send your precious love into some distant time
[03:24.18]And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing
[03:32.03]Send your love
[03:36.88]Send your love
[03:47.61]There's no religion but sex and music
[03:49.36]There's no religion that's right or winning
[03:51.42]There's no religion in the path of hatred
[03:53.35]Ain't no prayer but the one I'm singing
[04:03.10]Send your love
[04:11.65]Send your love
