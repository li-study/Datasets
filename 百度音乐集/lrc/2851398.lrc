[00:20.18]I wish the dawn may know nothing of the name that I told the night
[00:36.34]I wish like mist in the morning it drifts away silently to hide away
[02:38.18][01:18.29]So carry away to never see light of day
[02:44.27][01:24.28]keep hidden away for eternity - a secret song
[01:39.86]I dream the day could proclaim the love of the name that I told the night
[01:55.50]I dream that glorious daylight uncovers the mystery I hide away
[02:58.50]I pray to hide from the sunset the secret I told the day
[03:14.95]I pray to carry away the love and drift away silently and hide away
