[00:16.09]Well I've been running from something
[00:19.56]Twenty years in my car
[00:23.30]Down a road that's leading me nowehere
[00:29.61]Yeah we drive through the farmland
[00:33.46]No one knows where we're from
[00:37.01]Could I kiss you and make you a queen?
[00:41.69]Or something in between
[00:44.09]
[00:46.84]Do you want to see
[00:54.20]The place where I am free?
[01:01.42]Cos in my mind I need it
[01:08.33]But you're nowhere near to me
[01:12.79]
[01:30.24]Move to new york city
[01:33.85]Take your woman by the hand
[01:37.20]Leave her there with your things on the doorstep
[01:43.78]And there's no way around it
[01:47.35]Could this be our last dance?
[01:50.76]So fall asleep with the tv darling
[01:56.32]I'll be back again
[01:58.52]
[02:00.66]Do you want to see
[02:07.85]The place where I was free?
[02:14.80]Cos in my mind I've been there
[02:21.88]And there's no one here but me
[02:26.41]
[02:49.39]In the morning it'll find you
[02:53.24]Let the light shine away
[02:56.75]Down a road that's leading me nowhere
[03:03.20]And there's no way around it
[03:06.77]Could this be our last dance?
[03:10.15]Just fall asleep with the tv darling
[03:15.45]I'll be back again
[03:28.12]I'll be back again
