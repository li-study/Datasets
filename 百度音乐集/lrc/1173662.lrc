[00:24.33][00:17.61]
[00:12.88]by Enya, Cornet by Steve Sidwell
[00:45.41]Each time on my leaving home
[00:51.63]I run back to my mother's arms
[00:59.61]one last hold and then it's over
[01:06.57]
[01:10.46]Watching me, you know I cry
[01:16.03]you wave a kiss to say goodbye
[01:23.13]Feel the sky fall down upon me
[01:31.54]
[02:49.56][01:34.02]All I am a child with promises
[02:58.67][01:44.03]All I have are miles full of promises of home
[01:57.01]If only I could stay with you
[02:04.25]my train moves on, you're gone from view
[02:12.79]Now I must wait until it's over
[02:26.15]
[03:12.09]Days will pass, your words to me
[03:19.64]it seems so long; eternity
[03:27.08]but I must wait until it's over
[03:38.89]
