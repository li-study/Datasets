[00:16.23]Well I was doubling over the load on my shoulders
[00:20.55]Was a weight I carried with me everyday
[00:24.25]Crossing miles of frustrations and rivers a raging
[00:28.62]Picking up stones I found along the way
[00:32.41]I staggered and I stumbled down
[00:35.24]Pathways of trouble
[00:37.19]I was hauling those souvenirs of misery
[00:40.83]And with each step taken my back was breaking
[00:45.21]'Til I found the One who took it all from me
[00:49.39]Down by the riverside
[00:51.67](Down by the riverside)
[00:53.66]I laid my burdens down,
[00:55.61]Now I'm traveling light
[00:57.47]My spirit lifted high
[00:59.79](I found my freedom now)
[01:02.49]I found my freedom now
[01:04.10]And I'm traveling light
[01:06.48]
[01:22.92]Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
[01:27.18]I was dragging those heavy chains of doubt and fear
[01:31.08]Then with the one word spoken the locks were broken
[01:35.45]Now He's leading me to places
[01:37.64]Where there are no tears
[01:39.39]Down by the riverside
[01:41.79](Down by the riverside)
[01:43.86]I laid my burdens down,
[01:45.90]Now I'm traveling light
[01:47.66]My spirit lifted high
[01:50.36](I found my freedom now)
[01:52.33]I found my freedom now
[01:54.03]And I'm traveling light
[01:56.57]
[02:12.70]Down by the riverside
[02:16.90]I laid my burdens down,
[02:19.31]Now I'm traveling light
[02:21.17]My spirit lifted high
[02:24.02]I found my freedom now
[02:27.48]And I'm traveling light
[02:29.43]Down by the riverside
[02:31.94](Down by the riverside)
[02:34.20]I laid my burdens down,
[02:36.00]Now I'm traveling light
[02:37.65]My spirit lifted high
[02:40.20](I found my freedom now)
[02:42.37]I found my freedom now
[02:44.30]And I'm traveling light
[02:46.21]Down by the riverside
[02:48.67](Down by the riverside)
[02:50.26]I laid my burdens down,
[02:52.67]Now I'm traveling light
[02:54.29]My spirit lifted high
[02:56.87](I found my freedom now)
[02:58.28]I found my freedom now
[03:00.79]And I'm traveling light
[03:02.43](Traveling light, traveling light)
[03:05.44]I found my freedom now
[03:10.55](Traveling light, traveling light)
[03:15.58]Oh...
