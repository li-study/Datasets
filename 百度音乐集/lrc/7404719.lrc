[00:00.73]Over My Head(Cable Car)
[00:01.95]The Fray
[00:03.11]
[00:04.83]I never knew
[00:06.69]I never knew that everything was falling through
[00:10.70]That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
[00:15.06]To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
[00:20.54]But that's how it's got to be
[00:23.07]It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
[00:26.99]I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
[00:31.25]The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
[00:37.37]
[00:37.99]Everyone knows I'm in
[00:41.59]Over my head
[00:43.68]Over my head
[00:45.93]With eight seconds left in overtime
[00:49.81]She's on your mind
[00:51.96]She's on your mind
[00:56.91]
[01:02.68]Let's rearrange
[01:04.53]I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
[01:08.45]Just say that we agree and then never change
[01:12.53]Soften a bit until we all just get along
[01:18.97]But that's disregard
[01:20.84]Find another friend and you discard
[01:24.84]As you lose the arguments in a cable car
[01:29.18]Hanging above as the canyon comes between
[01:35.30]
[01:35.87]Everyone knows I'm in
[01:39.50]Over my head
[01:41.62]Over my head
[01:43.92]With eight seconds left in overtime
[01:47.81]She's on your mind
[01:49.93]She's on your mind
[01:52.39]
[01:52.92]Everyone knows I'm in
[01:56.28]Over my head
[01:58.18]Over my head
[02:00.36]With eight seconds left in overtime
[02:04.28]She's on your mind
[02:06.50]She's on...oh...
[02:09.04]
[02:09.70]And suddenly I become a part of your past
[02:14.76]I'm becoming the part that don't last
[02:19.25]I'm losing you and its effortless
[02:25.57]Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
[02:29.52]In the throw around
[02:31.24]Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
[02:35.22]I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
[02:43.59]
[02:44.61]Everyone knows I'm in
[02:45.82]Over my head
[02:47.97]Over my head
[02:50.18]With eight seconds left in overtime
[02:54.02]She's on your mind
[02:56.18]She's on your mind
[03:00.76]
[03:01.74]Everyone knows
[03:05.31]She's on your mind
[03:09.04]Everyone knows I'm in over my head
[03:12.09]I'm in over my head
[03:13.99]I'm over my...
[03:14.96]
[03:15.27]Everyone knows I'm in
[03:18.85]Over my head
[03:20.99]Over my head
[03:23.43]With eight seconds left in overtime
[03:27.12]She's on your mind
[03:29.16]She's on your mind
