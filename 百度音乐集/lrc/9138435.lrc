[00:05.47]We Are The World
[00:08.01]Michael Jackson
[00:11.33]
[00:14.06]There is a time when we should heed a certain call
[00:20.43]Cause the world it seems it’s right in this line
[00:27.14]Cause there’s a chance for taking in needing our own lives
[00:34.38]It seems we need nothing at all
[00:41.46]I used to feel that I should give away my heart
[00:48.12]And it shows that fear of needing them
[00:54.76]Then I read the headlines and it said they’re dying there
[01:01.92]And it shows that we must heed instead
[01:08.25]We are the world
[01:11.68]We are the children
[01:15.12]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[01:18.40]So let’s start giving
[01:22.58]But there’s a chance we’re taking
[01:26.10]We’re taking our own lives
[01:29.55]It’s true we’ll make a brighter day just you and me
[01:38.95]
[01:40.46]Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
[01:46.81]Cause you know that they can feed them all
[01:53.83]Than I read the paper and it said that you’ve been denied
[02:00.76]And it shows the second we will call
[02:07.03]We are the world
[02:10.37]We are the children
[02:13.83]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[02:16.95]So let’s start giving
[02:21.02]But there’s a chance we’re taking
[02:24.86]We’re taking our own lives
[02:28.30]It’s true we’ll make a brighter day just you and me
[02:35.42]No there’s a time when we must love them all
[02:42.26]And it seems that life, it don’t make love at all
[02:48.67]But if you’d be there, and I’ll love you more and more
[02:55.97]It seems in life, i didn’t do that
[03:02.29]We are the world
[03:05.64]We are the children
[03:09.09]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[03:12.19]So let’s start giving
