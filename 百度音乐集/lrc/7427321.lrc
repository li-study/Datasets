[00:00.50]Allentown
[00:03.50]Billy Joel
[00:15.50][00:08.50]
[00:17.50]Well we're living here in Allentown
[00:21.50]And they're closing all the factories down
[00:26.50]Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
[00:29.50]Filling out forms
[00:31.50]Standing in line
[00:34.50]Well our fathers fought the Second World War
[00:38.50]Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
[00:42.50]Met our mothers at the USO
[00:46.50]Asked them to dance
[00:48.50]Danced with them slow
[00:51.50]And we're living here in Allentown
[00:54.50]
[00:55.50]But the restlessness was handed down
[00:59.50]And it's getting very hard to stay
[01:15.50][01:07.50]
[01:18.50]Well we're waiting here in Allentown
[01:22.50]For the Pennsylvania we never found
[01:26.50]For the promises our teachers gave
[01:30.50]If we worked hard
[01:32.50]If we behaved
[01:35.50]So the graduations hang on the wall
[01:39.50]But they never really helped us at all
[01:43.50]No they never taught us what was real
[01:47.50]Iron and coke
[01:49.50]And chromium steel
[02:09.50][01:55.50]
[01:52.50]And we're waiting here in Allentown
[01:56.50]But they've taken all the coal from the ground
[02:00.50]And the union people crawled away
[02:14.50]Every child has a pretty good shot
[02:18.50]To get at least as far as their old man got
[02:22.50]But something happened on the way to that place
[02:26.50]They threw an American flag in our place
[02:38.50][02:32.50]
[02:41.50]Well I'm living here in Allentown
[02:45.50]And it's hard to keep a good man down
[02:50.50]But I won't be getting up today
[03:22.50][03:10.50][03:03.50][02:58.50]
[03:26.50]And it's getting very hard to stay
[03:32.50]And we're living here in Allentown
