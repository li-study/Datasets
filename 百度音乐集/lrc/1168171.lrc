[00:10.86]So I'm listening for the weather to predict the coming day
[00:16.56]Leave all thought of expectation to the weather man
[00:22.17]No it doesn't really matter what it is he has to say
[00:27.62]'Cause tomorrows keep on blowing in from somewhere
[00:33.44]All the people that I know in the apartments down below
[00:39.13]Busy with their starring roles in their own tragedies
[00:45.47]Sunlight sends you on your way
[00:50.14]And those restless thoughts that cling to yesterday
[00:54.97]Never be afraid of change
[00:59.85]I'll call you on the phone
[01:01.74]I hate to leave you on your own
[01:05.03]But I'm coming home today
[01:10.39]And this busy inner city
[01:13.61]Has got nothing much to say
[01:16.10]And I know how much you're hanging round the letterbox
[01:21.86]And I'm sure that as I'm writing
[01:25.03]You'll be somewhere on your way
[01:27.50]In a supermarket checkout or the restaurant
[01:33.14]I've been doing what I'm told
[01:35.74]I've been busy growing old
[01:38.83]And the days are getting cold but that's alright with me
[01:44.75]Sunlight sends you on your way
[01:49.63]And those restless thoughts that cling to yesterday
[01:54.34]Never be afraid of change
[01:59.38]I'll call you on the phone
[02:01.28]I hate to leave you on your own
[02:04.66]But I'm coming home today
[02:09.00]Yes I'm coming home today
[02:15.89]
[02:38.42]I've been doing what I'm told
[02:40.99]I've been busy growing old
[02:43.97]And the days are getting cold but that's alright with me
[02:50.26]Sunlight sends you on your way
[02:54.69]And those restless thoughts that cling to yesterday
[02:59.44]Never be afraid of change
