[00:00.00]Vampire Weekend - Holiday
[00:02.00]
[00:07.43]Holiday, oh, a holiday
[00:10.35]And the best one of the year
[00:13.65]Underneath my sheets
[00:16.63]While I cover both my ears
[01:52.25][00:49.20][00:20.05]But if I wait for a holiday
[01:55.19][00:52.00][00:22.82]Could it stop my fears?
[00:54.93][00:25.89]To go away on a summer's day
[02:01.25][00:58.18][00:28.87]Never seemed so clear
[00:36.56]Holiday, still so far away
[00:39.76]A republic on the beach
[00:42.95]I can't forget just how bad it gets
[00:45.80]When I'm counting on my teeth
[01:11.56]A vegetarian since the invasion
[01:15.36]She'd never seen the word "bombs"
[01:18.34]She'd never seen the word bombs blown up to 96 point Futura
[01:24.25]She'd never seen an A-K in a yellowy day-glo display
[01:30.47]A teacher so lovely, it turned all the history books red
[01:39.50]I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
[01:42.67]And a healthy sense of worth
[01:45.87]Half of me is the gasoline
[01:48.73]But the other half's the surf
[01:58.24]To away on a summer's day
