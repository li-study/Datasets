[00:10.59]I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
[00:15.29]I only know I never want to let you go
[00:19.86]'Cause you started something, can't you see
[00:24.76]That ever since we met you've had a hold on me
[00:29.73]It happens to be true
[00:34.28]I only want to be with you
[00:38.89]It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
[00:43.88]I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
[00:48.74]Look what has happened with just one kiss
[00:53.51]I never knew that I could be in love like this
[00:58.26]It's crazy but it's true
[01:02.95]I only want to be with you
[01:08.56]You stopped and smiled at me, asked me if I'd care to dance
[01:17.35]I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance
[01:25.79]Now listen honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere
[01:31.99]As long as we're together honey I don't care
[01:36.56]'Cause you started something, can't you see
[01:41.15]That ever since we've met you've had a hold on me
[01:55.58][01:46.18]No matter what you do
[02:00.36][01:50.69]I only want to be with you
