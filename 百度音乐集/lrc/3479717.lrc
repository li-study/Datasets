[00:-1.00]

[00:21.00]
[00:22.15]Get-ups, gimmicks
[00:24.36]One hit wonders that don't stick
[00:27.07]Pretty boys acting tough
[00:29.50]Boy bands give it up
[00:31.62]
[00:31.92]And if it looks good on TV
[00:34.27]It'll look good on a CD
[00:36.84]Shape it up, trim it down
[00:39.42]Who gives a damn 'bout how it sounds
[00:41.90]
[00:42.21]I don't think Waylon done it that way
[00:47.02]And if he was here he'd say Hoss, neither did Hank
[00:51.97]I ain't dogging what you're doing
[00:54.38]But boys come on let's get real
[00:58.74]You still got a lotta boot left to fill
[01:02.70]
[01:12.47]You say you're the real deal
[01:14.79]But you play what nobody feels
[01:17.33]You sing about Johnny Cash
[01:19.90]The man in black would've whipped your ass
[01:22.44]
[01:22.70]I don't think Waylon done it that way
[01:27.40]And if he was here he'd say Hoss, neither did Hank
[01:32.10]I ain't dogging what you're doing
[01:35.16]But boys come on let's get real
[01:39.72]You still got a lotta boot left to fill
[01:44.70]
[02:00.27]So so long 'til I see you again
[02:05.31]When you're laying in the bargain bin
[02:09.76]
[02:10.42]Well I don't think Waylon done it that way
[02:15.49]And if he was here he'd say Hoss, neither did Hank
[02:20.46]I ain't dogging what you're doing
[02:22.66]But then again, hell yes I am
[02:26.79]I just don't give a damn
[02:30.00]'Cause you still got a lotta boot left to fill
[02:35.45]I guess we all got a lotta boot left to fill
[02:41.11]
