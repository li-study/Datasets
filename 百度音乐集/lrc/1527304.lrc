[00:38.50]My young love said to me
[00:46.40]My mother won't mind
[00:54.50]And my father won't slight you
[01:01.40]For your lack of kind
[01:10.00]
[01:12.30]she stepped away from me
[01:20.00]And she moved through the fair
[01:27.00]And fondly I watched her
[01:34.00]Move here and move there
[01:41.00]And then she went onwards
[01:48.00]Just one star awake
[01:55.00]Like the swan in the evening
[02:02.00]Moves over the lake
[02:09.00]
[03:37.00]Last night she came to me
[03:44.00]My dead love came in
[03:51.00]So softly she came
[03:58.00]That her feet made no din
[04:05.00]And she laid her hand on me
[04:12.00]And this she did say
[04:19.00]It will not be long now
[04:26.00]And she moved through the fair
