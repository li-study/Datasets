[00:10.48]
[00:14.25]Where I come from isn't all that great
[00:17.08]My automobile is a piece of crap
[00:19.98]My fashion sense is a little whack
[00:22.34]And my friends are just as screwy as me
[00:25.41]I didn't go to boarding schools
[00:28.09]Preppy girls never looked at me
[00:30.74]Why should they I ain't nobody
[00:33.46]Got nothing in my pocket

[00:58.47]Look at all those movie stars
[01:00.51]They're all so beautiful and clean
[01:03.59]When the housemaids scrub the floors
[01:06.01]They get the spaces in between
[01:09.49]I wanna live a life like that
[01:12.14]I wanna be just like a king
[01:14.83]Take my picture by the pool
[01:17.66]Cause I'm the next big thing!
[02:03.82]The truth is...I don't stand a chance
[02:08.39]Its something that you're born into...
[02:11.23]And I just don't belong...
[02:13.48]No I don't
[02:15.06]I'm just a no class, beat down fool
[02:17.61]And I will always be that way
[02:20.35]I might as well enjoy my life
[02:22.91]And watch the stars play
