[ti:caught in a moment]
[00:26]Your stare swallows me
[00:31]And I can hardly breathe
[00:34]I feel it's dangerous,
[00:37]Could be deadly
[00:40]Somehow I'm willing to do the things you want
[00:47]Take me in your arms
[00:50]Spoon-feed my heart and
[00:52]Drip by drip
[00:54]I'll take it all
[00:56]Sip by sip
[00:57]I guess that it's
[00:59]Make or break
[01:01]Boy here and now
[01:04]We're caught in a moment
[01:07]And I won't let it go
[01:11]I am falling deeper, losing my control
[01:17]Involved in a feeling
[01:20]Like the blink of a eye
[01:24]And the silence it belongs to you and I
[01:32]Broke through barriers
[01:36]And passed a state of mind
[01:39]I'm not scared no more
[01:42]It feels divine
[01:46]So take me in
[01:50]And catch me when I fall
[01:52]I'm waiting on the edge
[01:55]Uncut my soul
[01:57]Snip by snip
[02:00]I'm oozing it
[02:01]Bit by bit
[02:03]I'm taking it
[02:04]Step by step
[02:06]Boy here and now
[02:10]We're caught in a moment
[02:13]And I won't let it go
[02:17]I am falling deeper, losing my control
[02:23]Involved in a feeling
[02:26]Like the blink of a eye
[02:30]And the silence it belongs to you and I
[02:37]Secretly I let it slip
[02:40]Emotional I fall through it
[02:43]All I know I'm losing my control
[02:51].......way too far
[02:53]And there's no turning back
[02:57]And now I'm shedding all my fears
[03:00]I know, I know
[03:06]We're caught in a moment
[03:09]And I won't let it go (let it go)
[03:13]I am falling deeper, losing my control (my control)
[03:19]Involved in a feeling (involved in a feeling)
[03:22]Like the blink of a eye (eye)
[03:26]And the silence it belongs to you and I (I)
[03:32]oooh ahhh ooooh oooh
