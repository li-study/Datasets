[00:12.27]
[00:15.27]Keep me suspended in the air just like a puppet
[00:19.00]If you keep tugging on my arm you're gonna hurt it
[00:22.83]I'm feeling so beneath the real I'm gasping for air
[00:26.74]Cos I don't wanna try the nothing then it's not there
[00:29.07]
[00:30.07]You keep playing with me
[00:31.78]And damn, it just feels so mean
[00:33.70]You got me strung up on the motion baby why can't you see
[00:37.59]It's kind of funny to me
[00:39.49]The way you say you love me
[00:41.45]I can't believe I tried to trust you but you always diss me
[00:45.01]
[00:46.01]My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
[00:49.93](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[00:53.69]You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
[00:57.63](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:00.42]
[01:01.42](Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:05.32](Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:09.29](Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:13.04](Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:16.13]
[01:17.13]I wear my heart out on my sleeve but you just don't care
[01:20.85]I lose my footing, hit the ground and you are not there
[01:24.75]Now that I learned to pick myself up it's just not that fair
[01:28.60]The way you think you got a hold on my heart
[01:31.55]
[01:32.55]My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
[01:36.31](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:40.13]You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
[01:44.07](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[01:46.93]
[01:47.93]Who do you think you are
[01:50.06]I only have one heart
[01:52.02]And I just can't avoid to let you toy with me again
[01:55.68]I try to understand why you wanna control these hands
[01:59.78]You make it hard for me to even call myself a man
[02:02.49]
[02:03.49]My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
[02:07.29](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[02:11.11]You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
[02:15.02](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
[02:17.86]
[02:18.86]My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
[02:22.80](Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
