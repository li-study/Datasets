[00:46.03]Once upon a time
[00:49.44]Once when you were mine
[00:52.91]I remember skies
[00:56.12]Reflecting in your eyes
[00:59.20]I wonder where you are
[01:02.71]I wonder if you think about me
[01:06.38]Once upon a time
[01:08.99]In your wildest dreams
[01:18.21]Once the world was new
[01:21.28]Our bodies felt the morning dew
[01:24.50]That greets the brand new day
[01:28.33]We couldn't tear ourselves away
[01:31.50]I wonder if you care
[01:34.95]I wonder if you still remember
[01:38.67]Once upon a time
[01:41.28]In your wildest dreams
[01:47.32]And when the music plays
[01:50.39]And when the words are touched with sorrow
[01:53.96]When the music plays
[01:56.87]I hear the sound I had to follow
[02:00.72]Once upon a time
[02:05.84]Once beneath the stars

[02:15.99]And all I knew was you
[02:19.13]I wonder if you know
[02:22.66]I wonder if you think about it
[02:26.17]Once upon a time
[02:28.84]In your wildest dreams
[03:08.02]And when the music plays
[03:10.38]And when the words are touched with sorrow
[03:13.88]When the music plays
[03:20.58]And when the music plays
[03:23.97]I hear the sound I had to follow
[03:27.35]Once upon a time
[03:32.55]Once upon a time
[03:35.90]Once when you were mine
[03:39.38]I remember skies
[03:42.64]Mirrored in your eyes
[03:45.71]I wonder where you are
[03:49.36]I wonder if you think about me
[03:52.82]Once upon a time
[03:55.39]In your wildest dreams
[04:02.56]In your wildest dreams
[04:09.20]In your wildest dreams
[04:16.08]]In your wildest dreams
