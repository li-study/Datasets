[00:13.91]by Bonnie Bramlett and Eric Clapton
[00:16.65]The rain is falling through the mist of sorrow that surrounded me.
[00:22.68]The sun could never thaw away the the bliss that lays around me.
[00:32.20]Let it rain, let it rain,
[00:36.00]Let your love rain down on me.
[00:39.39]Let it rain, let it rain,
[00:41.84]Let it rain, rain, rain.
[00:50.73]Her life was like a desert flower burning in the sun.
[00:55.70]Until I found the way to love, it's harder said than done.
[01:18.33]Chorus
[01:54.28]Now I know the secret; there is nothing that I lack.
[02:01.34]If I give my love to you, you'll surely give it back.
[02:10.26]Let it rain, let it rain,
[02:12.57]Let your love rain down on me.
[02:16.29]Let it rain, let it rain,
[02:20.28]Let it rain, rain, rain.
