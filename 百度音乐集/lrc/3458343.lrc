[00:06.45]送给Clumsy Mina   恻影
[00:16.51]I pray you'll be our eyes
[00:23.29]And watch us where we go
[00:29.52]And help us to be wise
[00:35.83]In times when we don't know
[00:42.77]Let this be our prayer
[00:49.84]As we go our way
[00:58.34]Lead us to a place
[01:02.21]Guide us with your grace
[01:06.65]To a place where we'll be safe
[01:15.15]I pray we'll find your light
[01:22.32]and hold it in our hearts
[01:27.50]When stars go out at night
[01:34.19]Remind us where you are
[01:40.48]Let this be our prayer
[01:47.19]When shadows fill our day
[01:56.12]Lead us to a place
[01:59.81]Guide us with your grace
[02:03.75]Give us faith so we’ll be safe
[02:12.92]
[02:16.56]I don't know whether you can see this LRC
[02:22.76]Maybe it just like my prayer for you
[02:32.63]
[02:50.75]We ask that life be kind
[02:57.00]And watch us from above
[03:02.93]We hope each soul will find
[03:09.81]Another soul to love
[03:13.29]Let this be our prayer
[03:20.23]Just like every child
[03:28.27]Needs to find a place
[03:32.27]Guide us with your grace
[03:36.27]Give us faith so we’ll be safe
[03:43.68]Needs to find a place,
[03:47.87]Guide us with your grace
[03:56.30]Give us faith so we’ll be safe
[04:08.85]
[04:11.79]Hoping that one day you will feel my feeling
