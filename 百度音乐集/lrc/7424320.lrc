[01:11.53]Softly did you sing to me outside my window in my dreams
[01:17.91]When I woke I could hear your voice in me
[01:28.66]One day we'll have the time to stop the time and we'll plant 2000 dreams
[01:41.55]

[02:05.27]When we are watching movie then I'll sleep
[02:12.16]When we are swiming out to sea
[02:22.51]There we go outside to listy canayon
[02:29.69]But we know what it means to you
[02:41.38]Coz we live giving something
[02:53.96]There's no wanting anything in return
[03:03.68]
[03:06.38]Ah......Wo......
[03:21.12]
[03:23.77]There above circle around you when ripples under riverbank you give your words to me
[03:41.10]Sometimes it's into sun and it's into pools
[03:47.98]When we know how it feels to breathe
[03:58.51]So gather all your fortune around you now
[04:05.24]It didn't take too long to figure out you won't be needing any of it now
[04:17.09]Will you?
[04:20.48]
[04:24.47]Ah......Wo......
[04:41.78]Ah......Wo......
