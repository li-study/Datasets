[00:23.24]Saying goodbye
[00:26.39]is never an easy thing
[00:29.75]But you never said,
[00:32.97]that you'd stay forever
[00:36.25]So if you must go
[00:39.54]Well, darlin', I'll set you free
[00:42.79]But I know in time
[00:46.04]That we'll be together
[00:51.08]Oh, I won't try
[00:53.26]To stop you now from leaving
[00:56.68]Cause in my heart I know
[ Chorus ]
[01:01.79]Love will lead you back
[01:04.96]Someday I just know that
[01:08.30]Love will lead you back to my arms
[01:12.74]Where you belong
[01:15.78]I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
[01:21.37]One day you will find me again
[01:25.86]It won't be long
[01:28.94]One of these days
[01:30.58]Our love will lead you back
[01:38.66]One of these nights
[01:41.81]Well I'll hear your voice again
[01:45.14]You're gonna say,
[01:48.47]Oh, how much you miss me
[01:51.69]You walked out this door
[01:54.88]But someday you'll walk back in
[01:58.28]Oh, darling I know
[02:01.38]Oh, I know this will be
[02:06.21]Sometimes it takes,
[02:08.73]Sometime out on your own now
[02:11.98]To find your way back home
[ Chorus ]
[02:17.07]Love will lead you back
[02:20.35]Someday I just know that
[02:23.72]Love will lead you back to my arms
[02:28.18]Where you belong
[02:31.15]I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
[02:36.75]One day you will find me again
[02:41.42]It won't be long
[02:44.27]One of these days
[02:45.87]Our love will lead you back
[02:54.98]
[03:15.20]But I won't try to stop you now from leaving
[03:20.97]Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

[03:43.14]I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
[03:48.82]One day you will find me again
[03:53.32]It won't be long
[03:56.26]One of these days
[03:57.85]Our love will lead you back
[04:05.38]Love will lead you back
[04:08.62]Someday I just know that
[04:12.01]Love will lead you back to my arms
