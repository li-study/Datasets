[00:17.50]Whoa, let the sun beat down upon my face
[00:22.50]And stars to fill my dream
[00:26.50]I am a traveler of both time and space
[00:31.50]To be where I have been
[00:35.50]T' sit with elders of the gentle race
[00:39.50]This world has seldom seen
[00:44.50]Th' talk of days for which they sit and wait
[00:48.50]All will be revealed
[01:12.50]Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
[01:16.50]Whose sounds caress my ear
[01:21.50]But not a word I heard could I relate
[01:25.50]The story was quite clear
[01:29.50]Whoa-hoh, whoa-wa-oh
[02:16.50]Oooh, oh baby, I been flyin'
[02:29.50]Lord, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
[02:45.50]Oh, oooh yes, I've been flying
[02:59.50]Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'
[03:21.50]Oh, all I see turns to brown
[03:35.50]As the sun burns the ground
[03:46.50]And my eyes fill with sand
[03:58.50]As I scan this wasted land
[04:08.50]Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I beeeeeuhoaoh
[04:37.50]Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
[04:42.50]Like thoughts inside a dream
[04:47.50]Heed the path that led me to that place
[04:51.50]Yellow desert stream
[04:55.50]My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
[04:59.50]Will return again
[05:04.50]Sure as the dust that floats b'hind you
[05:09.50]When movin' through Kashmir
[05:32.50]Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
[05:36.50]Across the sea of years
[05:40.50]With no provision but an open face
[05:45.50]'Long the straits of fear
[05:49.50]Whaoh, whaoh
[05:58.50]Whaoh-oh, oh
[06:05.50]Ohhhh
[06:38.50]Well, when I want, when I'm on my way, yeah
