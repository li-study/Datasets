[00:15.57]O holy night
[00:17.76]the stars are brightly shining
[00:23.44]It is the night of the dear Savior’s birth
[00:30.96]Long lay the world in sin and error pining
[00:38.29]Till He appeared and the soul felt it’s worth
[00:45.08]A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
[00:51.92]For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
[00:58.89]Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
[01:11.39]O night divine, O night when Christ was born
[01:19.82]Night divine …. O night when Christ
[01:36.96]O night divine, O night, O night divine
[01:39.45]O night …. O night divine

[01:48.56]Truly He taught us to love one another
[01:56.46]His law is love and His gospel is peace
[02:03.58]Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
[02:10.63]And in His name all oppression shall cease
[02:18.16]Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
[02:24.73]Let all within us praise his holy name
[02:31.61]Christ is the Lord that ever and ever praise thee
[02:37.63]His power His glory ever more proclaim
[02:58.24]And Glory
[02:59.87]His power and glory ever more proclaim
