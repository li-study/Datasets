[00:03.09] Too much love will kill you
[00:07.24]Queen
[00:12.69]I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
[00:19.04]Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
[00:26.35]I'm far away from home
[00:29.44]And I've been facing this alone
[00:32.47]For much too long
[00:38.87]I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
[00:45.33]About growing up and what a struggle it would be
[00:52.99]In my tangled state of mind
[00:55.84]I've been looking back to find
[00:58.79]Where I went wrong
[01:06.19]Too much love will kill you
[01:08.94]If you can't make up your mind
[01:12.73]Torn between the lover
[01:15.52]And the love you leave behind
[01:19.17]You're headed for disaster
[01:22.05]'cos you never read the signs
[01:25.90]Too much love will kill you
[01:28.69]Every time
[01:35.64]
[01:41.04]I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
[01:47.54]And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
[01:55.09]I used to bring you sunshine
[01:58.23]Now all I ever do is bring you down
[02:07.13]How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
[02:14.13]Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
[02:21.29]No there's no making sense of it
[02:24.42]Every way I go I'm bound to lose
[02:35.04]Too much love will kill you
[02:37.88]Just as sure as none at all
[02:41.27]It'll drain the power that's in you
[02:44.40]Make youPlead and scream and crawl
[02:47.81]And the pain will make you crazy
[02:50.96]You're the victim of your crime
[02:54.75]Too much love will kill you
[02:57.66]Every time
[03:06.25]
[03:30.64]Too much love will kill you
[03:33.48]It'll make your life a lie
[03:36.81]Yes, too much love will kill you
[03:39.97]And you won't understand why
[03:43.48]You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
[03:46.65]But here it comes again
[03:50.68]Too much love will kill you
[03:56.14]In the end……
[04:03.00]In the end.
