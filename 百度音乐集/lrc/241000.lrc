[00:18.21]Sometimes
[00:20.32]Sometimes when I let myself drift into daydreams
[00:25.39]They're about you
[00:28.99]And somehow
[00:31.24]When I touch your skin my heart begin to do things
[00:36.10]How about you?
[00:39.36]And the strangest thing about it is
[00:42.05]I'm scared to blink in case I miss
[00:44.94]You and your beautiful ways
[00:50.09]Somewhere
[00:52.28]Somewhere in between the now and the beginning
[00:57.45]Who cares when?

[01:37.75]Oh we're riding
[01:40.36]On a bicycle that's built to last a lifetime
