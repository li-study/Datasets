[00:00.50]Bad Love
[00:01.50]Eric Clapton
[00:02.50]By Renc
[01:00.50]Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you
[01:08.80]You take my heart into everything you do
[01:15.50]And it makes me sad for the lonely people
[01:20.50]I walked that road for so long
[01:23.50]Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
[01:28.50]Your love is making me strong
[01:31.00]I've had enough bad love
[01:34.90]I need something I can be proud of
[01:38.90]I've had enough bad love
[01:43.90]No more bad love
[02:02.00]And now I see that my life has been so blue
[02:10.50]With all the heartaches I had till I met you
[02:17.00]But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me
[02:21.90]With you here by my side
[02:25.00]And there's no more memories to remind me
[02:29.50]Your love will keep me alive

[04:08.90]I've had enough bad love
[04:12.90]I need something I can be proud of
[04:16.50]I've had enough bad love
[04:21.00]No more bad love
