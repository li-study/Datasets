[00:09.39]I need you to know this won't be broken
[00:16.80]And all that we said will not be lost into the dawn
[00:23.59]And you would be the last thing I saw coming
[00:30.15]I'm still surprised
[00:33.22]
[00:34.80]You are lovely tonight
[00:41.80]You, dear, will guide me into the morning light
[00:49.03]You are lovely tonight
[00:57.34]Lay here beside me - I see the rest of my life with you
[01:05.16]
[01:14.94]Alone we are fine; but when we're two, we are eternal
[01:22.29]The moons have aligned our separate lives; here become one
[01:29.47]And you would be the last thing I saw coming
[01:35.63]I'm still surprised
[01:39.25]
[01:40.19]You are lovely tonight
[01:47.33]You, dear, will guide me into the morning light
[01:54.66]You are lovely tonight
[02:03.22]Lay here beside me - I see the rest of my life with you
[02:11.06]
[02:13.42]All my life I've lived alone without you
[02:20.88]All this time I couldn't find a way to belong
[02:27.66]
[02:28.34]And you are lovely tonight
[02:36.62]You, dear, will guide me into the morning light
[02:43.70]You are lovely tonight
[02:52.02]Lay here beside me - I see the rest of my life with you
