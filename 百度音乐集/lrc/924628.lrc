[00:00.00]Il Divo - O Holy Night
[00:03.48]
[00:05.48]O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
[00:15.67]It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
[00:23.79]
[00:27.07]Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
[00:36.96]Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
[00:46.83]
[00:47.80]A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
[00:57.96]For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
[01:07.43]
[01:07.75]Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
[01:25.91]O night divine, oh night when Christ was born;
[01:44.28]
[01:45.59]O night divine, oh night oh night divine.
[02:02.85]O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
[02:12.66]It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
[02:21.57]
[02:23.08]Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
[02:33.34]Let all within us praise His holy name.
[02:43.19]
[02:43.78]Christ is the Lord, Let ever ever praise
[03:00.61]Thee Noel, Noel
[03:12.78]O night, o night divine
[03:23.00]O night, divine, o night
[03:36.44]O holy night.
