[00:08.20], Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[00:13.50]I'm begging of you please don't take my man
[00:20]Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[00:25.70]Please don't take him just because you can
[00:32]Your beauty is beyond compare
[00:34.20]With flaming locks of auburn hair
[00:36.50]With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
[00:42.80]Your smile is like a breath of spring
[00:45]Your voice is soft like summer rain
[00:47.50]And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
[00:52]
[00:53.80]He talks about you in his sleep
[00:55.80]There's nothing I can do to keep
[00:58]From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
[01:03]
[01:04.50]And I can easily understand
[01:06.90]How you could easily take my man
[01:08.80]But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
[01:14]
[01:15.50]Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[01:20.50]I'm begging of you please don't take my man
[01:27]Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[01:32.60]Please don't take him just because you can
[01:38]
[01:39.50]You could have your choice of men
[01:41.60]But I could never love again
[01:43.60]He's the only one for me, Jolene
[01:49]
[01:50]I had to have this talk with you
[01:51.90]My happiness depends on you
[01:54]And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
[02:00]
[02:01]Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[02:06]I'm begging of you please don't take my man
[02:12.50]Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
[02:18]Please don't take him even though you can
