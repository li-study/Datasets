[00:05.30]Run To You
[00:10.30]whitney houston
[00:15.30]
[00:21.80]I know that when you look at me
[00:28.18]There's so much that you just don't see
[00:34.44]But if you would only take the time
[00:41.08]I know in my heart you'd find
[00:46.48]A girl who's scared sometimes
[00:50.03]Who isn't always strong
[00:53.52]Can't you see the hurt in me?
[00:56.12]I feel so all alone
[00:58.05]
[00:58.67]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[01:05.55]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[01:12.33]Won't you hold me in your arms
[01:15.27]And keep me safe from harm
[01:18.51]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[01:24.93]But if I come to you (oooh)
[01:31.17]Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
[01:43.41]
[01:44.79]Each day, each day I play the role
[01:50.49]Of someone always in control
[01:56.75]But at night I come home and turn the key
[02:03.01]There's nobody there, no one cares for me
[02:09.58]What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
[02:15.30]Without someone to share it with
[02:18.36]Tell me what does it mean?
[02:22.07]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[02:27.82]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[02:35.08]Won't you hold me in your arms
[02:38.40]And keep me safe from harm
[02:41.13]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[02:47.27]But if I come to you (oooh)
[02:53.79]Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
[03:06.35]run away
[03:12.56]
[03:14.17]I need you here
[03:16.27]I need you here to wipe away my tears
[03:18.85]To kiss away my fears
[03:24.47]If you only knew
[03:26.87]how much I wanna run to you
[03:34.91]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[03:41.16]Won't you hold me in your arms
[03:44.59]And keep me safe from harm
[03:49.17]I wanna run to you (oooh)
[03:54.06]But if I come to you (oooh)
[04:00.32]Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
