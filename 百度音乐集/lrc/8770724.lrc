[00:12.73]I know your eyes in the morning sun
[00:16.40]I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
[00:21.68]And the moment that you wander far from me
[00:26.85]I wanna feel you in my arms again
[00:31.36]And you come to me on a summer breeze
[00:36.53]Keep me warm in your love
[00:39.02]Then you softly leave
[00:41.59]And it's me you need to show
[00:45.32]How deep is your love
[00:48.31]How deep is your love
[00:51.67]I really mean to learn
[00:55.36]'Cause we're living in a world of fools
[01:00.04]Breaking us down
[01:02.66]When they all should let us be
[01:07.44]We belong to you and me
[01:11.62]I believe in you
[01:14.39]You know the door to my very soul
[01:19.60]You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
[01:24.73]You're my saviour when I fall
[02:27.87][01:29.20]And you may not think I care for you
[02:32.03][01:33.99]When you know down inside that I really do
[02:38.28][01:39.12]And it's me you need to show
[02:43.34][01:42.98]How deep is your love
[01:45.99]How deep is your love
[02:51.20][01:49.46]I really mean to learn
[02:53.29][01:52.80]'Cause we're living in a world of fools
[02:57.95][01:57.62]Breaking us down
[03:00.77][02:00.29]When they all should let us be
