[00:00.00]Kidz Bop Kids - Sorry
[00:01.50]
[00:06.05]Oh, I had a lot to say
[00:12.53]Was thinking on my time away
[00:19.92]I missed you and things weren't the same
[00:26.52]'Cause everything inside it never comes out right
[00:33.83]And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die
[00:42.34]I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry I'm blue
[00:45.96]I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
[00:49.62]And I know I can't take it back
[00:56.58]I love how you sing, I love how it sounds
[01:00.40]And baby the way you make my world go 'round
[01:04.58]And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
[01:15.01]
[01:19.07]This time I think I'm to blame
[01:25.89]It's harder to get through the days
[01:33.21]We get older and blame turns to shame
[01:39.75]'Cause everything inside it never comes out right
[01:47.08]And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die
[01:55.60]I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry I'm blue
[01:59.32]I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
[02:02.95]And I know I can't take it back
[02:09.92]I love how you sing, I love how it sounds
[02:13.87]And baby the way you make my world go 'round
[02:17.60]And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
[02:25.95]
[02:26.80]Every single day I think about how we came all this way
[02:32.90]The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
[02:36.51]It's never too late to make it right
[02:41.11]Oh yeah, sorry
[02:45.40]I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry I'm blue
[02:48.68]I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
[02:52.30]And I know I can't take it back
[02:59.20]I love how you sing, I love how it sounds
[03:03.31]And baby the way you make my world go 'round
[03:07.59]And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
[03:21.00]I'm sorry baby
[03:24.91]I'm sorry baby
[03:28.72]I'm sorry
