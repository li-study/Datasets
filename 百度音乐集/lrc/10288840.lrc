[00:07.27]Herrick Hayashi Ben
[00:07.61]I wait for you.
[00:11.24]I don't know why.
[00:13.76]all i know is i can't hide.
[00:18.45]at this temperature you could take over my mind.
[00:31.43]like gossamer, you softly touch.
[00:37.52]he draws me in, i'm powerless.
[00:43.76]he possesses an enchantment.
[00:55.02]tell me i'm forgiven.
[01:01.55]he calls, don't know how i fell under his spell.
[01:10.38]lately i've been driven. he smiles, an enchantment.
[01:29.26]i wait for you.
[01:32.37]I'm mesmerized this love is like a potion in disguise.
[01:41.68]i'd tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes.
[01:53.61]I can't escape, or so it seems.
[02:00.02]I'd run away, he's in my dreams.
[02:05.70]he possesses an enchantment.
[02:17.20]tell me i'm forgiven.
[02:23.89]he calls, don't know how i fell under his spell.
[02:32.68]lately i've been driven.
[02:39.42]he smiles, an enchantment.
[02:50.00]it's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends.
[02:53.27]a type of loan with no dividends.
[02:56.07]it's a parlour game where you're given chase.
[02:59.01]guess it could be called an acquired taste.
[03:03.11]i know, he knows, he calls, i go, i know.
[03:09.12]this could be an enchantment.
[03:13.40]why don't you tell me i'm forgiven?
[03:21.33]he calls, don't you know how i fell under his spell.
[03:31.66]i'm forgiven...lately i've been driven.
[03:41.04]he smiles and i give in,
[03:47.14]an enchantment.
