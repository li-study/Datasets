[00:02]Commodores
[00:03]Three Times A Lady
[00:04]
[00:05]Thanks for the times
[00:09]that you've given me,
[00:14]The mem'ries are all in my mind.
[00:24]And now that we've come
[00:28]to the end of our rainbow
[00:34]There's something
[00:36]I must say out loud.
[02:58][00:46]You're once,
[03:01][00:49]twice,
[03:04][00:52]three times a lady,
[03:09][00:58]and I love you.
[01:05]Yes, you're once,
[01:08]twice,
[01:11]three times a lady,
[01:17]and I love you.
[03:19][01:26]I love you.
[01:37]
[01:40]When we are together
[01:44]the moments I cherish,
[01:49]with every beat of my heart.
[01:58]To touch you,
[02:01]to hold you,
[02:03]to feel you,
[02:05]to need you.
[02:08]There's nothing to keep us apart.
