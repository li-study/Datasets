[00:22.00]Light fails at dawn
[00:25.00]The moon is gone
[00:27.00]And deadly the night reigns
[00:32.00](Deceit)Finally I\'ve found myself
[00:34.00]In these lands
[00:36.00]Horror and madness I\'ve seen here
[00:41.00]For what I became a king of the lost?
[00:46.00]Barren and lifeless the land lies
[00:50.00]Lord of all Noldor
[00:53.00]A star in the night
[00:54.00]And a bearer of hope
[00:55.00]He rides into his glorious battle alone
[00:57.00]Farewell to the valiant warlord
[01:00.00]The Fate of us all
[01:02.00]Lies deep in the dark
[01:04.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[01:09.00]The Fate of us all
[01:11.00]Lies deep in the dark
[01:14.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[01:19.00]
[01:34.00]I stand alone
[01:38.00]Noone\'s by my side
[01:43.00]I\'ll dare you
[01:45.00]Come out
[01:48.00]You coward
[01:50.00]Now it\'s me or you
[01:52.00]He gleams like a star
[01:53.00]And the sound of his horn\'s
[01:54.00]Like a raging storm
[01:56.00]Proudly the high lord
[01:58.00]Challenges the doom
[01:59.00]Lord of slaves he cries
[02:01.00]Slowly in fear
[02:04.00]The dark lord appears
[02:06.00]Welcome to my lands
[02:08.00]You shall be damned
[02:11.00]Lord of all Noldor
[02:13.00]A star in the night
[02:14.00]And a bearer of hope
[02:15.00]He rides into his glorious battle alone
[02:17.00]Farewell to the valiant warlord
[02:20.00]The Fate of us all
[02:22.00]Lies deep in the dark
[02:25.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[02:29.00]The Fate of us all
[02:32.00]Lies deep in the dark
[02:34.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[02:39.00]
[03:26.00]The iron crowned
[03:27.00]Is getting closer
[03:28.00]Swings his hammer
[03:29.00]Down on him
[03:30.00]Like a thunderstorm
[03:32.00]He\'s crushing
[03:33.00]Down the Noldor\'s
[03:34.00]Proudest king
[03:35.00]Under my foot
[03:37.00]So hopeless it seems
[03:40.00]You\'ve troubled my day
[03:42.00]Now feel the pain
[03:45.00]Lord of all Noldor
[03:47.00]A star in the night
[03:48.00]And a bearer of hope
[03:49.00]He rides into his glorious battle alone
[03:51.00]Farewell to the valiant warlord
[03:54.00]The Fate of us all
[03:56.00]Lies deep in the dark
[03:59.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[04:03.00]The Fate of us all
[04:06.00]Lies deep in the dark
[04:08.00]When time stands still at the iron hill
[04:13.00]
[04:20.00]The Elvenking\'s broken
[04:22.00]He stumbles and falls
[04:24.00]The most proud and most valiant
[04:25.00]His spirit survives
[04:27.00]Praise our king
[04:31.00]Praise our king
[04:35.00]Praise our king
[04:38.00]Praise our king
[04:41.00]
