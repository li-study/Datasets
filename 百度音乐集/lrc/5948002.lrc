[00:01.80]走了
[00:02.60]演唱：王啸坤
[00:03.00]
[00:03.03]我从来不会怀疑
[00:10.39]当每次风雨悄来临
[00:15.61]若太艰辛也带我去
[00:22.69]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[00:28.05]
[00:32.43]忘不了那双暖的手
[00:39.67]承担我不曾懂的痛
[00:44.78]还没有说一切保重
[00:52.44]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[00:57.51]
[01:01.15]浮华点亮歌声起
[01:08.28]世界并不公平
[01:15.78]天使执着于征途
[01:20.91]有人在笑
[01:26.64]
[01:29.45]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[01:37.01]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[01:42.61]
[01:46.44]我从来不会怀疑
[01:53.56]当每次风雨悄来临
[01:58.87]若太艰辛也带我去
[02:06.35]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[02:12.00]
[02:44.50]浮华点亮歌声起
[02:51.69]世界本不公平
[02:59.31]天使执着于征途
[03:04.36]有人在笑
[03:11.16]
[03:12.83]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[03:20.66]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[03:26.26]
[03:29.69]不要介意我的期待
[03:36.87]请平安完整的回来
[03:42.20]生命很短只盼相伴
[03:49.67]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[03:55.17]
[03:56.95]生命很短只盼相伴
[04:04.37]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[04:09.49]
[04:12.06]生命很短只盼相伴
[04:19.14]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[04:26.49]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[04:33.79]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[04:41.14]BUT SHE HAS ALREADY GONE
[04:48.59]BUT SHE
