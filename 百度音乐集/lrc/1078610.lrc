[00:18.50]Sail away with me
[00:25.98]Far across the sea
[00:29.74]In the name of love - in the name - in the name of love
[00:39.34]Follow the stars in the heavens above
[00:44.79]We can be free
[00:48.68]Down to the sea
[00:52.22]We can be free
[00:57.49]
[00:59.81]So take my hand
[01:03.27]And feel our blessing
[01:07.02]We are the stardust
[01:10.12]Angels who dream or dream up sailing
[01:17.63]When we are free
[01:21.86]To find a blessing, a blessing of love
[01:30.86]
[01:32.50]Listen to the bells
[01:38.60]Ringing in the square
[01:43.52]Calling us to live - and to give in the name of love
[01:51.50]As all of our tears turn the rain into dust
[01:58.68]Filling our hearts
[02:02.39]Healing our souls
[02:06.06]Making us whole
[02:10.84]
[02:13.59]So take my hand
[02:17.09]And feel our blessing
[02:20.91]We are the stardust
[02:24.12]Angels who dream or dream up sailing
[02:31.90]When we are free
[02:35.58]To find a blessing, a blessing of love
[02:44.38]
[02:45.26]Two hearts travel \'cross the universe
[02:52.54]Through the darkest heart of midnight
[03:00.03]How can I live without the hope that we
[03:05.99]Might touch the edge of heaven\'s light
[03:16.69]
[03:27.30]So take my hand
[03:31.12]And feel our blessing
[03:34.77]We are the only ones who
[03:38.14]Know our way back home
[03:42.14]We\'ve sailed so far away
[03:45.64]Still I know we\'ll be home someday
[03:49.28]If we follow our hearts and our souls
[03:52.09]We can find our blessing of love
[03:58.38]
[04:00.87]Blessing of love
[04:08.34]Blessing of love
