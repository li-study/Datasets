[00:12.81]Shane:I`m dreaming of a white christmas
[00:23.02]Just like the ones I used to know
[00:32.69]Where the treetops glisten and children listen
[00:43.71]to hear sleigh bells in the snow
[00:55.39]I`m dreaming of a white christmas
[01:06.60]with every christmas card I write
[01:15.56]May your days be merry and bright
[01:26.38]And may all your christmas be white
[02:07.15]Where the treetops glisten and children listen
[02:18.52]to hear sleigh bells in the snow
[02:29.53]I'm dreaming of a white christmas
[02:40.34]with every christmas card I write
[02:49.24]May your days be merry and bright
[03:01.70]And may all your christmas be white
