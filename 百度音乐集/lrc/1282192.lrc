[00:02.50]Our Song
[00:04.50]Taylor Swift
[00:06.50]
[00:11.98]I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
[00:15.12]in the front seat of his car
[00:17.29]He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
[00:20.15]The other on my heart
[00:23.48]I look around, turn the radio down
[00:25.57]He says baby is something wrong?
[00:28.13]I say nothing I was just thinking
[00:31.16]how we don't have a song
[00:34.33]And he says...
[00:35.67]Our song is the slamming screen door,
[00:38.32]Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
[00:41.42]When you're on the phone and you talk real slow
[00:44.35]Cause it's late and your mama don't know
[00:46.63]Our song is the way you laugh
[00:49.03]The first date "man, I didn't kiss her,but I should have"
[00:52.14]And when I got home ... before I said amen
[00:57.87]Asking God if he could play it again
[01:03.35]
[01:07.61]I was walking up the front porch steps
[01:11.19]after everything the day
[01:13.43]Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
[01:16.32]And lost and thrown away
[01:18.96]Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
[01:23.57]I almost didn't notice all the roses
[01:26.91]And the note that said...
[01:28.00]
[01:29.46]Our song is the slamming screen door,
[01:31.98]Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
[01:34.88]When you're on the phone and you talk real slow
[01:38.34]Cause it's late and your mama don't know
[01:40.54]Our song is the way you laugh
[01:42.48]The first date "man, I didn't kiss her,but I should have"
[01:46.23]And when I got home ... before I said amen
[01:51.66]Asking God if he could play it again
[01:57.00]
[02:08.24]I've heard every album, listened to the radio
[02:13.27]Waited for something to come along
[02:18.83]That was as good as our song...
[02:22.18]Cause our song is the slamming screen door
[02:24.63]Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
[02:27.65]When you're on the phone and you talk real slow
[02:30.84]Cause it's late and your mama don't know
[02:33.13]Our song is the way you laugh
[02:35.07]The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, but I should have"
[02:38.88]And when I got home ... before I said amen
[02:44.35]Asking God if he could play it again...
[02:54.83]
[03:04.84]I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
[03:07.55]In the front seat of his car
[03:10.70]I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
[03:12.71]And I... wrote down our song
[03:16.50]
