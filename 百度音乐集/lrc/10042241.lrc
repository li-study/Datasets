[00:08.24]
[00:15.45]Ben, the two of us need look no more
[00:22.44]We both found what we were looking for
[00:29.61]With a friend to call my own
[00:34.34]I'll never be alone
[00:37.82]And you, my friend will see
[00:41.37]You've got a friend in me
[00:45.42](You've got a friend in me) 
[00:50.61]Ben, you're always running here and there
[00:56.07](Here and there)
[00:57.68]You feel you're not wanted anywhere
[01:03.21] (anywhere)
[01:04.54]If you ever look behind
[01:09.35]And don't like what you find

[01:20.27](You've got a place to go) 
[01:25.08]I used to say "I" and "me"

[01:39.28](I used to say "I" and "me"

[01:54.01]Ben, most people would turn you away
[01:58.90](Turn you away)
[02:00.97]I don't listen to a word they say
[02:06.28](A word they say)
[02:08.00]They don't see you as I do
[02:12.78]I wish they would try to
[02:16.22]I'm sure they'd think again
[02:19.28]If they had a friend like Ben
[02:25.66](A friend) 
[02:28.52]Like Ben
[02:32.92](Like Ben)
