[00:26.05]Hey michel how's life are you ok
[00:32.23]I wonder if you ever think of me
[00:41.70]It's been 9 years since that kiss
[00:47.42]I can help but reminisce
[00:51.06]Hey michel do you remember
[00:53.63]
[00:57.29]We walked the street to the beat
[00:59.30]Hand in hand you and me
[01:04.88]Smiling faces so in love
[01:06.95]Hoping that they all could see
[01:10.82]That we belonged together
[01:14.21]you and me against the world
[01:18.59]But we found out the hard way
[01:22.00]cause it wasn't meant to be
[01:25.80]
[01:27.00]Now it's you and her i see
[01:30.25]
[01:44.70]You were my first and worst love
[01:52.64]And so it only could go wrong
[02:01.27]But ain't that just the way you learn
[02:07.62]Hey michel i just wanted to let you know
[02:17.08]That someone else has stolen my heart
[02:24.88]And now another girl has caught your eye
[02:32.11]That doesn't mean i don't think of you
[02:40.31]I am just hoping that she'll treat you right
[02:42.21]
[02:45.01]Do you remember
[02:46.78]How we walked the street to the beat
[02:48.60]Hand in hand and you and me
[02:54.09]Smiling faces so in love
[02:56.13]Hoping that they all could see
[02:59.89]That we belonged together
[03:03.25]you and me against the world
[03:08.02]But we found out the hard way
[03:11.18]cause it wasn't meant to be
[03:15.17]
[03:15.69]Now it is you and her i see
[03:22.75]
[03:23.81]It was just a silly dream
[03:30.92]LaLaLa...
[03:56.00]Hey michel do you remember
