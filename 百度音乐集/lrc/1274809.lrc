[00:00.00]John Mayer - Home Life
[00:16.58]
[00:18.58]I think I'm gonna stay home
[00:23.00]Have myself a home life
[00:27.41]Sitting in the slow-mo
[00:31.92]And listening to the daylight
[00:36.54]I am not a nomad
[00:40.96]I am not a rocket man
[00:45.55]I was born a housecat
[00:49.62]By the slight of my mother's hand
[00:52.94]
[00:54.79]I think I'm gonna stay home
[00:57.42]
[00:59.40]I want to live in the center of a circle
[01:03.88]I want to live of the side of a square
[01:08.36]I used to be in my M-Z now
[01:12.90]You'll never find me cause my name isn't there
[01:16.42]Home life
[01:19.84]Been holding out for the home life
[01:25.15]My whole life
[01:28.25]
[01:35.09]I want to see the end game
[01:39.71]I want to learn her last name
[01:43.97]Finish on a Friday
[01:48.03]And sit in traffic on the highway
[01:52.12]See, I refuse to believe
[01:56.72]That my life's gonna be
[02:01.22]Just some string of incompletes
[02:06.71]Never to lead me to anything remotely
[02:10.04]close to a home life
[02:13.93]Been holding out for the home life
[02:19.27]My whole life
[02:23.16]
[02:28.98]I can tell you this much
[02:30.97]I will marry just once
[02:32.88]And if it doesn't work out
[02:35.55]Give her half of my stuff
[02:37.40]It's fine with me
[02:41.67]We said eternity
[02:46.52]And I will go to my grave
[02:49.26]With the life that I gave
[02:50.95]Now just some melody line
[02:53.40]On a radio wave
[02:55.39]It dissipates
[02:59.47]And soon evaporates
[03:04.04]But home life doesn't change
[03:08.87]
[03:10.12]I want to live in the center of a circle
[03:14.49]I want to live on the side of a square
[03:19.03]I'd love to walk where we both can talk but
[03:23.51]I've got to leave you cause my ride is here
[03:26.95]Home life
[03:31.13]You take the home life
[03:35.68]You keep the home life
[03:39.89]I'll come back for the home life
[03:42.13]I promise
[03:43.44]Home life I promise
[03:45.64]
