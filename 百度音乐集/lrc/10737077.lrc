[00:00.22]Bob Dylan - It's All Over Now, Baby Blue
[00:03.35]
[00:08.06]You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.
[00:16.80]But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
[00:25.54]Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
[00:32.78]Crying like a fire in the sun.
[00:40.89]Look out the saints are comin' through
[00:48.34]And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
[00:53.40]
[00:56.35]The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
[01:04.66]Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
[01:12.18]The empty-handed painter from your streets
[01:19.63]Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
[01:27.55]This sky, too, is folding under you
[01:35.40]And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
[01:40.28]
[01:43.84]All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
[01:51.42]All your reindeer armies, are all going home.
[01:58.75]The lover who just walked out your door
[02:06.44]Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
[02:14.42]The carpet, too, is moving under you
[02:21.86]And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
[02:27.08]
[03:16.10]Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
[03:24.03]Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
[03:31.69]The vagabond who's rapping at your door
[03:39.11]Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
[03:46.82]Strike another match, go start anew
[03:54.44]And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
[03:59.40]
