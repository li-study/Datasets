[00:10.00][No Surprises]
[00:20.00]
[00:25.00]A heart that's full up like a landfill,
[00:35.00]A job that slowly kills you,
[00:42.00]Bruises that won't heal.
[00:52.00]You were so tired and happy,
[00:59.00]Bring down the government,
[01:05.00]They don't, They don't speak for us.
[01:18.00]I'll take the quiet life,
[01:24.00]A handshake, some carbon monoxide.
[01:32.00][01:37.00][01:43.00][02:17.00][02:23.00][02:29.00][03:12.00][03:18.00][03:24.00]No alarms and no surprises,
[01:50.00][01:57.00]Silent.
[02:04.00]This is my final fit,
[02:10.00]My final bellyache with
[02:35.00][03:31.00]please.
[03:00.00]Such a pretty house,
[03:05.00]Such a pretty garden.
