[00:00.00]WAITING
[00:01.00]Compose / Lyrics / Vocal / Green Day.
[00:02.00]
[00:03.00]I've been waiting for a long time
[00:04.00]For this moment to come
[00:07.00]I'm destined
[00:09.00]For anything...at all
[00:14.00]Downtown lights will be shining
[00:18.00]On me like a diamond
[00:21.00]Ring out under the midnight hour
[00:28.00]No one can touch me now
[00:31.00]And I can't turn my back
[00:34.00]It's too late ready or not at all
[00:42.00]I'm so much closer than
[00:45.00]I have ever known...
[00:48.00]Wake up
[00:52.00]Dawning of a new era
[00:56.00]Calling...don't let it catch you falling
[01:01.00]Ready or not at all
[01:06.00]So close enough to taste it
[01:10.00]Almost...I can embrace this
[01:13.00]Feeling....on the tip of my tongue
[01:55.00][01:20.00]I'm so much closer than
[01:59.00][01:23.00]I have ever known...
[02:54.00][02:03.00][01:27.00]Wake up
[03:01.00][02:10.00][01:33.00]Better thank your lucks stars....
[02:25.00]I've been waiting for a long time
[02:28.00]For this moment to come
[02:31.00]I'm destined for anything at all
[02:40.00]Dumbstruck
[02:42.00]Color me stupid
[02:44.00]Good luck
[02:45.00]You're gonna need it
[02:47.00]Where I'm going if I get there...
[02:51.00]At all...
[03:05.00]
[03:06.00]BEYOND再见理想
[03:08.00]
