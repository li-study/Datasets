[00:00.50]Tears For Fears
[00:08.50]Break It Down Again
[00:21.50]
[00:25.50]Here we go
[00:30.50]Break it down again
[00:34.50]So those are my dreams
[00:37.50]And these are my eyes
[00:39.50]Stand tall like a man
[00:41.50]Head strong like a horse!
[00:44.50]When it's all mixed up
[00:46.50]Better break it down
[00:48.50](ooh-hoo...ooh-hoo)
[00:53.50]In the world of secrets
[00:54.50]In the world of sound
[00:57.50](ooh-hoo)
[01:00.50]
[01:01.50]It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
[01:05.50]See for yourself you have been sitting on a time-bomb
[01:10.50]No revolution, maybe someone somewhere else
[01:14.50]Can show you something new about you and your inner song
[01:18.50]And all the love, and all the love in the world
[01:23.50]Won't stop the rain from falling, waste seeping underground
[01:27.50](Break it down again)
[01:30.50]I want to break it down
[01:32.50](Break it down again)
[01:34.50]Break it down again
[01:39.50]So those are my schemes
[01:41.50]And these are my plans
[01:43.50]Hot tips for the boys
[01:45.50]Fresh news from the force!
[01:48.50]When it's all mixed up
[01:50.50]Better break it down
[01:52.50](ooh-hoo...ooh-hoo)
[01:56.50]In the world of silence
[01:59.50]In the world of sound
[02:01.50](ooh-hoo...)
[02:03.50]
[02:05.50]"No sleep for dreaming" say the architects of life
[02:09.50]Big bouncing babies, bread and butter, can I have a slice?
[02:13.50]They make no mention of the beauty of decay
[02:18.50]Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day
[02:22.50]And all the love, and all the love in the world
[02:26.50]Won't stop the rain from falling, waste seeping underground
[02:31.50](Break it down again)
[02:33.50]I want to break it down
[02:35.50](Break it down again)
[02:39.50]
[03:03.50]Horsin' around
[03:07.50]Pray to the power
[03:08.50]Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
[03:10.50]And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
[03:12.50]Play to the crowd
[03:15.50]Play to the crowd
[03:17.50]Play...
[03:20.50]It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
[03:24.50]Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
[03:28.50]No revolution, maybe someone somewhere else
[03:33.50]Can show you something new to help with the ups and downs
[03:37.50](Break it down again)
[03:39.50]I want to break it down
[03:41.50](Break it down again)
[03:44.50]Break it down again
[03:46.50](Break it down again)
[03:51.50](Break it down again)
[03:55.50]
[04:01.50]Break it down again
[04:06.50]No more sleepy dreamin'
[04:10.50]No more building up, it is time to dissolve
[04:19.50]Break it down again
[04:23.50]
