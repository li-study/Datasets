[00:14.02]I look at you looking at me
[00:18.10]Feels like a feeling meant to be
[00:22.71]And as your body moves with mine
[00:26.59]It's like I'm lifted out of time
[00:31.05]And time again
[00:34.31]Patiently I've waited
[00:37.21]For this moment to arrive
[00:45.48]After tonight
[00:49.49]Will you remember
[00:53.69]How sweet and tenderly
[00:57.71]You reached for me
[00:59.99]And pulled me closer
[01:02.52]After you go
[01:06.52]Will you return to love me
[01:11.16]After tonight begins to fade
[01:20.08]I feel your touch caressing me
[01:24.52]This feeling's all i'll ever need
[01:28.84]With every kiss from your sweet lips
[01:32.92]It's like I'm drifting out of time
[01:37.41]Alone will tell
[01:40.50]If you feel the way I feel
[01:44.82]When i look in your eyes
[01:51.93]After tonight
[01:55.80]Will you remember
[02:00.61]How sweet and tenderly
[02:04.30]You reached for me
[02:06.47]And pulled me closer
[02:08.79]After you go
[02:13.17]Will you return to love me
[02:18.26]After the night becomes the day
[02:36.81]Time
[02:38.29]And time and time again
[02:42.75]So patiently I've waited
[02:46.38]For this moment to arrive
[02:56.18]After tonight
[02:59.75]Will you remember
[03:04.33]How sweet and tenderly
[03:08.51]You reached for me
[03:10.43]And pulled me closer
[03:13.03]After you go
[03:16.72]Baby will you return to love me
[03:21.54]After the night becomes the day
[03:29.72]After tonight begins to fade
