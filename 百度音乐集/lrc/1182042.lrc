[00:16.84](Again... Again... Again... Again... ...)
[00:23.52]
[00:26.57]You dress me up, I'm your puppet
[00:30.61]You buy me things, I love it
[00:33.81]You bring me food, I need it
[00:37.73]You give me love, I feed it
[00:40.43]
[00:41.22]And look at the two of us in sympathy
[00:45.26]With everything we see
[00:48.28]I never want anything, it's easy
[00:52.38]You buy whatever I need
[00:54.17]
[00:55.20]But look at my hopes, look at my dreams
[00:59.73]The currency we've spent
[01:02.54](Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
[01:09.85](Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
[01:16.25]
[01:27.16]You phone me in the evening on hearsay
[01:31.63]And bought me caviar
[01:34.35]You took me to a restaurant off Broadway
[01:38.79]To tell me who you are
[01:40.22]
[01:41.05]We never-ever argue, we never calculate
[01:45.90]The currency we've spent
[01:48.62](Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent

[02:07.92]I'm your puppet
[02:12.85]I love it
[02:15.88]
[02:20.53]And look at the two of us in sympathy
[02:24.77]And sometimes ecstasy
[02:27.84]Words mean so little, and money less
[02:31.38]When you're lying next to me
[02:33.78]
[02:34.55]But look at my hopes, look at my dreams
[02:39.27]The currency we've spent
[02:41.79](Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
[02:49.29](Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent
[02:55.64](Ooooh) Ooh, I love you, you pay my rent
[03:01.51]
