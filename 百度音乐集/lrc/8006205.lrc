[00:08.00]My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
[00:10.00]Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
[00:12.00]Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
[00:14.00]Come and die with me forever
[00:15.00]Share insanity
[00:19.00]Do you want to die!
[00:24.00]The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
[00:26.00]Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
[00:28.00]Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
[00:30.00]What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
[02:05.00]Trapped in purgatory
[02:07.00]A lifeless object, alive
[02:09.00]Awaiting reprisal
[02:11.00]Death will be their acquisition
[02:13.00]The sky is turning red
[02:16.00]Return to power draws near
[02:18.00]Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
[02:20.00]Abolish the rules made of stone
[02:33.00]Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
[02:38.00]Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
[02:49.00]Awaiting the hour of reprisal
[02:52.00]Your time slips away
[03:21.00]Raining blood
[03:24.00]From a lacerated sky
[03:26.00]Bleeding its horror
[03:29.00]Creating my structure
[03:30.00]Now I shall reign in blood!
