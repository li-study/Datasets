[00:01.50]
[00:17.03]I'm not surprised
[00:18.46]Not everything lasts
[00:20.91]I've broken my heart so many times
[00:23.27]I stop keeping track
[00:25.01]Talk myself in
[00:26.80]I talk myself out
[00:28.87]I get all worked up
[00:30.26]And then I let myself down
[00:32.38]
[00:32.83]I tried so very hard not to loose it
[00:36.63]I came up with a million excuses
[00:40.42]I thought I thought of every possibility
[00:44.93]
[00:46.39]And I know someday that it'll all turn out
[00:50.32]You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
[00:54.45]And I promise you kid that I'll get so much more than I get
[01:01.18]I just haven't met you yet
[01:04.33]
[01:04.34]Mmmmm...
[01:09.11]
[01:11.54]I might have to wait
[01:13.75]I'll never give up
[01:15.69]I guess it's half timing
[01:17.56]And the other half's luck
[01:19.60]Wherever you are
[01:21.64]Whenever it's right
[01:23.61]You come out of nowhere and into my life
[01:26.91]
[01:27.82]And I know that we can be so amazing
[01:31.33]And baby your love is gonna change me
[01:35.12]And now I can see every possibility
[01:38.80]
[01:39.30]Mmmmmm...
[01:41.01]And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
[01:41.02]
[01:45.22]And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
[01:49.04]And I promise you kid that I'll get so much more than I get
[01:55.71]I just haven't met you yet
[01:59.14]
[01:59.18]They say all's fair
[02:03.26]And in love and war
[02:06.70]But I won't need to fight it
[02:09.54]We'll get it right
[02:11.51]And we'll be united
[02:16.26]
[02:31.65]And I know that we can be so amazing
[02:35.98]And baby your love is gonna change me
[02:39.86]And now I can see every single possibility
[02:44.82]Mmmmm...
[02:47.33]
[02:48.15]And someday I know that it'll all turn out
[02:52.98]And I'll work to work it out
[02:56.64]Promise you kid that I'll get more than I get
[03:02.37]Than I get than I get than I get
[03:05.33]
