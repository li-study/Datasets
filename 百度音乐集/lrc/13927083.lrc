[00:21.05]When you wish upon a star
[00:26.38]Makes no difference who you are
[00:31.59]Anything your heart desires
[00:36.55]Will come to you
[00:42.87]If your heart is in your dreams
[00:47.63]No request is to extreme
[00:53.67]When you wish upon a star
[00:58.49]As dreamers do
[01:26.20]Fate is kind
[01:32.47]She brings to those who love
[01:38.25]As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns
[02:09.78]Like a boat out of the blue
[02:15.03]Fate steps in and see's you through
[02:20.59]Moma when you wished upon a star
[02:25.51]Your dreams come true
