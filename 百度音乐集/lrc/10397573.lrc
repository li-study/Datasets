[00:03.92]What is in this wine
[00:05.30]the more I drink the more I wander off
[00:08.98]into a stranger's eyes
[00:10.63]I like the way that they reflect my thoughts
[00:14.75]what is in this air
[00:16.51]it feels like feathery dust everywhere
[00:19.67]and as I breathe it in
[00:21.68]I breathe the masculine scent of his skin
[00:25.73]
[02:11.01][02:00.60][00:39.39][00:28.23]and I feel homeless
[02:18.51][02:06.71][00:35.08]
[00:51.05]your comfortable caress
[00:52.86]has triggered unfamiliar restlessness
[00:56.47]you and I are we
[00:58.03]I feel I've lost my individuality
[01:01.77]
[02:47.70][01:02.18]you're watching me rebel
[02:49.87][01:03.59]believing stories only hearts can tell
[02:53.41][01:07.25]but when is it enough
[02:54.98][01:09.01]when do I call my feelings on their bluff
[03:01.20]
[01:24.67][01:13.26]and I feel homeless
[01:30.65][01:19.34]
[02:33.66][02:28.31][02:22.94][01:46.07][01:40.51][01:35.45]and I remember us now
[02:36.37][02:30.51][02:24.74][01:48.90][01:43.08][01:37.51]but I forgot what we felt like
[02:39.20][01:51.87]somewhere along the way
[02:43.32]
