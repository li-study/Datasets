[00:15.88]I used to run
[00:17.54]I used to hide
[00:18.83]From love
[00:20.10]But now I'm satisfied
[00:23.28]
[00:23.64]'Cause you showed me
[00:25.15]That love could be
[00:26.65]So good
[00:27.76]So real
[00:29.16]And oh so right
[00:30.85]
[00:31.83]So many things I used to let get in my way
[00:35.60]Now I open up my arms and say
