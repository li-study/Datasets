[00:00.00]
[00:52.71]Give me strength to face the truth
[00:56.41]The doubt within my soul
[01:00.48]No longer I can justify
[01:04.43]The blood shed in his name
[01:08.62]Is it a sin to seek the truth，
[01:12.49]the truth beneath the rose?
[01:16.66]Pray with me so I will find
[01:20.47]a gate to Heaven’s door
[01:24.74]I believed
[01:28.11]it would justify the means
[01:32.10]It had a hold over me
[01:40.71]wait and act to see
[01:44.24]the cruelty of the beast
[01:48.82]it is the darkest side of me
[01:55.67]（forgive me my sins）
[01:56.76]The field of my dreams
[02:00.27]decieved all I have seen
[02:04.63]Forgive me for what I have been
[02:11.74]（forgive me my sins）
[02:28.99]Pray for me
[02:30.80]’cause I have lost my faith in holy wars
[02:36.80]This paradise denied to me
[02:40.76]’cause I can’t take no more
[02:44.81]Has darkness taken over me，
[02:48.75]consumed my mortal soul?
[02:52.79]All my virtues sacrificed ，
[02:56.95]can Heaven be so cruel?
[03:01.14]I believed
[03:04.55]it would justify the means
[03:08.76]it had a hold over me
[03:17.18]Wait and act to see
[03:20.61]the cruelty of the beast
[03:25.08]it is the darkest side of me
[03:32.07]（forgive me my sins）
[03:33.22]The field of my dreams
[03:36.70]decieved all I have seen
[03:41.08]Forgive me for what I have been
[03:48.10]forgive me my sins
[03:50.13]I’m hoping， I’m praying
[03:52.50]I won’t get lost between two hearts
[03:56.23]Follow the sin
[03:58.90]the truth lies in between
[04:06.31]Give me the strength
[04:07.85]to face the wrong that I have done
[04:12.41]Now that I know
[04:15.04]the darkest side of me
[04:26.45]How can love be your salvation
[04:31.03]and justify the pain
[04:34.46]that we have caused through all the times
[04:42.58]Will I learn what’s true， the sacred
[04:47.01]Will I redeem my soul
[04:51.20]Will truth set me free?
[05:13.63]Wait and act to see
[05:17.19]the cruelty of the beast
[05:21.52]it is the darkest side of me
[05:28.66]（forgive me my sins）
[05:29.76]The field of my dreams
[05:33.17]decieved all I have seen
[05:37.50]Forgive me for what I have been
[05:44.70]forgive me my sins
