[00:19.32]If a picture paints a thousand words
[00:24.35]then why can't I paint you?
[00:29.87]The words will never show
[00:34.67]the you I've come to know.
[00:39.71]If a face could launch a thousand ships
[00:44.90]then where am I to go?
[00:50.04]There's no one home but you
[00:55.02]You're all that's left me, too.
[00:59.91]And when my love for life is running dry
[01:09.79]you come and pour yourself on me.
[01:19.69]If a girl could be to places
[01:24.83]at one time I'd be with you
[01:29.70]tomorrow and today
[01:34.96]beside you all the way.
[01:39.52]If the world show stop revolving
[01:44.57]spinning slowly down to die
[01:49.74]I'd spend the end with you
[01:54.66]and when the worlds was through
[01:59.47]then one by one the stars would all go out,
[02:09.24]then you and I would simply fade away.
