[00:18.18]Close your eyes and say goodnight
[00:25.56]And hold me till the morning light
[00:32.98]And when the sun comes shining through
[00:39.62]I′ll kiss you
[00:43.48]One last time
[00:48.88]And I′ll begin to live my life without you
[00:56.77]Wish that I could make you stay
[01:04.51]But I know I have no power to persuade
[01:12.07]The heart will do what it must do
[01:18.42]So kiss me
[01:22.40]One last time
[01:27.47]And tell me how to live my life without you
[01:33.96]′Cause I love you
[01:36.59]Without an ending
[01:38.22]′Cause I need you
[01:39.98]To be my everything
[01:42.18]Tell me the meaning of a life without you with me
[01:49.47]When the night falls
[01:51.80]I′ll still be standing
[01:53.59]′Cause you′ll always
[01:55.49]Be right here in my heart
[02:00.56]And in my deepest memories
[02:04.93]I won′t ever have to be
[02:08.65]Without you
[02:13.97]Love is like a work of art
[02:21.63]Once you feel it and you hold it in your heart
[02:29.48]You know forever that it′s true
[02:36.11]So kiss me
[02:39.71]For always
[02:43.65]Even if I live my life without you
