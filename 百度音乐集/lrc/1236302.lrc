[ti:walking after you]
[ar:foo fighters ]

[00:09.50]Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
[00:21.50]Dreaming aloud
[00:24.50]Things just won't do without you, matter of fact
[00:32.50]oooooooo
[00:36.50]I'm on your back,
[00:40.50]I'm on your back,
[00:47.50]oooooooo I'm on your back
[00:58.50]If you'd accept surrender, I'll give up some more
[01:10.50]Weren't you adored
[01:13.50]I cannot be without you, matter of fact
[01:21.50]oooooooo
[01:25.50]I'm on your back,
[01:33.50]If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
[01:48.50]If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
[02:00.50]Another heart is cracked in two, I'm on your back, ooooo
[02:36.50]I cannot be without you, matter of fact
[02:44.50]oooooooo
[02:48.50]I'm on your back,
[02:53.50]I'm on your back,
[02:59.50]oooooooo
[03:03.50]I'm on your back
[03:11.50]If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
[03:26.50]If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
[03:41.50]If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
