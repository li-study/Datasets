[00:13]No teacher to follow, no prophet to tell me how,
[00:18]But I know what I want, I know what I want now
[00:21]Like water, it rushes,
[00:23]it's the last thing you see when you close your eyes
[00:27]It's the one place you want to be.
[00:29]But if it doesn't brush my shoulder, and it doesn't beat my heart,
[00:32]that's not what I want, that's not where I will start.
[00:37]I never kissed somebody so that they would break my heart,
[00:40]that's not what I want.
[00:43]If you don't know what you're missing
[00:46]'Cause you don't know where to start
[00:47]Follow your wishing heart.
[00:51]I was restless,
[00:52]I was restless,
[00:53]I was restless,
[00:54]I was restless.
[00:55]I just want this to be good,
[00:56]I just want this to be good.
[00:58]- but you don't understand,
[00:59]you don't understand me, and I want to be understood.
[01:05]But if it doesn't brush my shoulder, and  it doesn't beat my heart,
[01:09]that's not what I want, that's not where I will start.
[01:12]I never kissed somebody so that they would break my heart,
[01:15]that's not what I want.
[01:20]If we all leap before we crawl, we might fall,
[01:27]and it's not always candy spun from head to heart,
[01:34]and it's not always meant to be,
[01:38]and it's not always up to me.
[01:44][01:58]But if it doesn't brush my shoulder, and it doesn't beat my heart,
[01:48][02:02]that's not what I want, that's not where I will start.
[01:52][02:06]I never kissed somebody so that they would break my heart,
[01:54][02:09]that's not what I want.
[02:28]If you don't know what you're missing
[02:33]'Cause you don't know where to start
[02:35]If you don't know what you're missing,
[02:38]Follow your wishing heart.
