[00:01.85]Artist: Giorgia Fumanti
[00:02.93]Album: From My Heart
[00:05.37]
[00:07.81]have you ever seen the light
[00:13.76]of the stars until the sky
[00:19.91]did it ever touch your heart
[00:24.32]grave the grace
[00:28.40]
[00:32.08]if you listen to the wind
[00:38.24]you can hear the song get seats
[00:44.40]even as you feel the grace
[00:48.79]on your face
[00:52.35]
[00:56.68]do you feel the glow
[01:02.83]all around your soul
[01:09.08]tell me do you know
[01:13.34]do you know
[01:18.48]
[01:19.27]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[01:28.46]everywhere you gone
[01:32.05]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[01:40.60]needn't to know
[01:43.55]needn't to know
[01:48.21]
[01:52.01]have you ever watched song
[01:58.24]see the colors changing around
[02:04.40]touch the sky and watch them faint
[02:09.02]but we...
[02:10.96]
[02:16.65]do you feel the glow
[02:22.88]all around your soul
[02:28.97]tell me do you know
[02:33.19]do you know
[02:36.68]
[02:38.96]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[02:48.19]everywhere you gone
[02:52.11]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[03:00.66]needn't to know
[03:03.62]needn't to know
[03:11.09]
[03:34.48]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[03:44.21]everywhere you gone
[03:47.77]there is a peace of heaven it fall around
[03:56.16]needn't to know
[03:59.34]needn't to know
