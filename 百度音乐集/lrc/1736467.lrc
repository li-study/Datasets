[00:05.03]"Loneliness"by mary.zhao
[00:08.66]
[00:10.29]Loneliness
[00:12.57]Is a place that I know well
[00:19.29]It's the distance between us
[00:24.07]And the space inside ourselves
[00:31.83]And emptiness....
[00:36.65]Is the chattering in your head
[00:43.47]It's the call of the living
[00:48.48]And the race from life to death
[00:54.02]Woa and I know
[00:59.83]Yes and I know
[01:05.20]What you feel...
[01:11.77]
[01:12.45]And I've got a longin'
[01:14.87]That's hard to find
[01:15.86]Won't give me no peace of mind
[01:18.58]Something that I've lived with all along
[01:24.23]Days and weeks and months and years
[01:27.24]Filling in the time my dear
[01:30.66]Tryin' to find the place where I belong
[01:35.19]
[01:38.42]Hopelessness
[01:42.52]is the darkness in your heart
[01:48.61]It's the sound of one hand clapping
[01:54.08]While it's pulling you apart
[02:00.12]Woa and I know
[02:05.69]Yes and I know
[02:10.73]What you feel
[02:15.76]
[02:16.25]And
[02:16.86]I've got a longin'
[02:17.89]That's hard to find
[02:21.52]Won't give me no peace of mind
[02:24.60]Something that I've lived with all along
[02:30.53]Days and weeks and months and years
[02:33.50]Filling in the time my dear
[02:36.63]Tryin' to find the place where I belong
[02:41.11]
[02:41.86]And
[02:42.70]I got a hunger that's
[02:45.26]Hard to fill
[02:45.91]Driving me on overkill
[02:48.65]Tellin' me that everything's gone wrong
[02:51.83]Got me a need
[02:55.90]That I can't break
[02:57.61]More than I can hardly take
[03:00.57]Somehow I still keep on going strong
[03:06.54]
[03:07.16]When I call your name
[03:08.13]I'm gonna scream out loud
[03:09.49]I'll say...
[03:10.09]"here I am standing in the crowd"
[03:12.40]You'll say "come to me"
[03:13.85]With your open mind
[03:15.34]you never know
[03:16.80]What you still might find"
[03:18.65]But you keep me here
[03:21.46]Like a cancelled flight
[03:22.47]An empty train
[03:22.79]Running through the night
[03:24.61]An orphan child
[03:27.52]A broken shoe
[03:28.04]and I'm still down here
[03:29.26]Looki' out for you
[03:30.55]Are you there for me?
[03:36.25]'Cause I'm here for you
