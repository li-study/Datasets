[02:19.00]Countless times I trusted you,
[02:25.00]I let you back in,
[02:29.17]Knowing... Yearning... you know
[02:33.72]I should have run... but I stayed
[02:46.40]Maybe I always knew
[02:54.29]My fragile dreams would be broken... for you
[03:16.39]Today I introduced myself
[03:21.67]To my own feelings
[03:26.77]In silent agony, after all these years
[03:31.63]They spoke to me... after all these years
[03:44.59]Maybe I always knew
[03:50.84]My fragile dreams would be broken... for you
