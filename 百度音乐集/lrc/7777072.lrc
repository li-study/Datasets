[00:20.43]
[00:20.59]I feel you, Johanna
[00:30.27]I feel you
[00:34.56]Do they think that walls can hide you?
[00:38.52]Even now I'm at your window
[00:42.37]I am in the dark beside you
[00:47.08]buried sweetly in your yellow hair,
[00:52.17]Johanna
[00:59.50]
[01:04.05]And are you beautiful and pale, with yellow hair, like her?
[01:11.21]I'd want you beautiful and pale, the way I've dreamed you were,
[01:17.46](both)Johanna
[01:24.83]And if you're beautiful what then with yellow hair, like wheat
[01:31.12]I think we shall not meet again my little dove, my sweet
[01:37.33]Johanna (Anthony)I'll steal you, Johanna
[01:44.64]
[01:44.80]Goodbye, Johanna
[01:48.12]You're gone, and yet you're mine
[01:50.84]I'm fine, Johanna, I'm fine (Anthony) Johanna
[02:02.83]
[02:06.80]Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil, sign of the devil, set it on fire
[02:13.32]Witch! Witch! Smell it sir, an evil smell,
[02:16.56]every night at the Vespers' bell, smoke that comes from the mouth of hell,
[02:19.90]set it on fire,set it on fire
[02:27.52]MIschief, mischief! Mischief!
[02:29.63]
[02:38.56]And if I never hear your voice, my turtle-dove, my dear
[02:44.84]I still have reason to rejoice the way your head is clear
[02:50.52]Johanna
[02:56.15]
[02:56.65](Anthony)I feel you,
[02:57.98](Todd)And in that darkeness when I'm blind with what I can't forget
[03:03.44](Anthony)Johanna
[03:04.41](Todd)It's always morning in my mind, my little lamb, my pet
[03:09.79](Todd)Johanna
[03:15.20]
[03:17.15](Todd)You stay, Johanna
[03:18.37](Anthony)Johanna
[03:20.27](Todd)The way I dreamed you were
[03:23.35](Todd)Oh look, Johanna, a star
[03:27.48](Anthony)Buried sweetly in your yellow hair
[03:31.65](Todd)A shooting star
[03:35.90]
[03:39.18]There, there! Somebody somebody, look up there,
[03:41.99]didn't I tell you, smell that air, set it on fire
[03:46.80]Quick, Sir, run and tell! Go on 'a Mole little ratchet spell,
[03:50.11]There it is, there it is, the ungodly smell, tell it to the
[03:52.23]fiddle and police as well, tell 'em, tell 'em, help, fiend!
[03:54.73]set it on fire
[03:57.82]set it on fire
[04:01.05]Mischief, mischief!
[04:03.87]
[04:13.30]And though I'll think of you I guess, until the day I die,
[04:19.48]I think I miss you less and less as every day goes by
[04:25.26]Johanna (Anthony) Johanna
[04:31.15]
[04:32.37]And you'd be beautiful and pale and look too much like her
[04:38.58]If only angels could prevail we'd be the way we were
[04:44.42]Johanna
[04:45.97](Anthony) I feel you, Johanna
[04:51.51]Wake up, Johanna!
[04:54.66]Unnerve the bright red day
[04:57.74]We learn Johanna, to say
[05:05.87]Goodbye
[05:11.55]
[05:11.86](Anthony) I'll steal you
[05:24.71]
