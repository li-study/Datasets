[00:17.95]But she did...
[00:22.59]Looking back on the argument
[00:25.23]All of it seems to turn into a great big blur
[00:28.51](Don't recall all that was said, but this relationship is dead)
[00:34.06]Dead in the water I thought
[00:36.44]Her response to my blatant disrespect would be her
[00:40.50](Regular thing) Regular thing
[00:42.11](Cry a bit, then eventually get over it; get over it)

[00:56.59](Not this time) She wasn't going for
[00:59.70]All my sweet talk, no not at all
[01:02.22]Nobody to blame, was all my fault
[01:05.13]tried to be slick, messed around and got caught
[01:08.00]I assumed she would forgive me,(like every time)
[01:14.15]But instead she said she's leaving
[01:19.54]Click Click, Bang Bang

[01:48.75](I don't know why I did it, but she was there so I did it, oh)
[01:54.18]And when I say I did it, I mean I did it,
[01:57.54]I smacked it, I flipped it, I rubbed it, she loved it (she loved it)
[02:00.71]So much she had to tell her girlfriend
[02:02.98](Who happened to be) My girlfriend
[02:05.42](Ooh-ooh-ooh, I guess that
[02:08.97]Was the straw that broke the camel's back)
