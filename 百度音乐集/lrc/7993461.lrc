[00:02.61]Heh, you know
[00:05.13]Someone loses someone they love everyday
[00:09.19]And I'm fortunate to still have you in my life
[00:13.85]'Cause I know I made some mistakes in the past but
[00:17.79]I'm tired of making excuses
[00:20.13]Listen
[00:20.91]
[00:21.25]For whatever might have been
[00:23.95]And all that it never was
[00:26.66]Whatever I couldn't see
[00:29.21]And all that I didn't want
[00:31.28]
[00:32.11]There was a method to my madness girl
[00:35.09]That wasn't clear to me
[00:37.65]Until the day I saw your face
[00:40.31]When I saw everything
[00:42.18]
[00:43.01]For I saw us dancing through sunshine and rain
[00:48.43]And I saw us laughing through joy and through pain
[00:53.62]And I saw time passing but we did not change
[00:58.99]And I still saw us together at the end of every day
[01:03.53]
[01:04.14]Whenever you want it
[01:06.57]Whenever you need it
[01:09.00]Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
[01:12.05]You better believe it
[01:14.62]Whenever you feel like dancing
[01:17.32]You don't have to dance alone, no

[01:49.26]Before I could even feel
[01:51.95]I knew you like no one else
[01:54.61]But still I couldn't tell, Oh
[01:57.44]Girl, none of it made sense to me
[02:00.47]Girl, none of it was real
[02:02.95]Until the day I saw your face
[02:05.71]And it was clear to see
[02:07.65]
[02:07.98]Whenever you want it (Whenever you want it)

[02:56.08]Hoping that they might find the chance
[02:58.48]where they can make things right
[03:01.44]Through my desire, thank God I found the fire
