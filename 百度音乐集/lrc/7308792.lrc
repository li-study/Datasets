[00:00.21]The Ready Set - There Are Days
[00:00.43]
[00:01.52]And I'll catch you now
[00:02.61]Oh, oh, oh,
[00:03.29]Catch you now,
[00:04.53]Oh, oh, oh,
[00:05.42]Catch you now,
[00:06.56]Oh, oh, oh
[00:09.05]
[00:09.61]I've been asleep since Monday morning,
[00:11.85]But I won't let time control me.
[00:13.88]Putting in my two weeks now, (yeah, yeah)
[00:18.12]And every day it's hard believing,
[00:20.29]It's getting worse each night I'm dreaming.
[00:22.56]In one split second I'm falling back, (yeah, yeah)
[00:26.18]
[00:26.74]It's all perfect in my life.
[00:31.25]Perfect in my life.
[00:35.37]
[00:36.03]I'll wave hello to the world.
[00:39.51]If you're falling down,
[00:41.13]I will catch you now.
[00:45.21]Watch from the stars and see that you're falling down.
[00:49.82]I will catch you now.
[00:52.88]
[00:54.29]A monumental mess worth meeting,
[00:56.85]it took a couple more nights stuck staring at the ceiling.
[00:59.04]Oh, do I really feel this way? (Yeah, yeah)
[01:03.17]'Cause I'm a spectator spectating,
[01:05.19]Wishing I could feel the warmth of spring.
[01:07.45]And it's thoughts like this that keep me up (yeah, yeah)
[01:11.47]
[01:11.89]It's still perfect in my life.
[01:16.52]Perfect in my life.
[01:20.24]
[01:21.19]I'll wave hello to the world.
[01:24.48]If you're falling down,

[01:54.12]
[01:55.37]There are days when I would rather be alone,
[01:59.70]not picking up the phone.
[02:01.18]It feels like I've been set free.
[02:03.77]But there is never a time when I wish I was gone.
[02:07.39]Whoa, whoa.
[02:11.84]
[02:13.10]I'll wave hello to the world.
[02:15.76]If you're falling down,
[02:17.49]I will catch you now.
[02:20.73]Watch from the stars and see that you're falling down.
