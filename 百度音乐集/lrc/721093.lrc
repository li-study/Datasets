[00:09.07]I'm just a love machine
[00:10.88]And I won't work for nobody but you,
[00:15.51]I'm just a love machine,
[00:17.48]A huggin', kissin' fiend.
[00:21.61]I think it's high time you knew,
[00:22.97]Whenever I think of you,
[00:25.12]My mind blows a fuse.
[00:28.37]When I look in you eyes,
[00:29.63]My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.
[00:34.72]My voltage regulator cools,
[00:38.17]When I'm sitting next to you,
[00:41.71]Electricity starts to flow,
[00:44.70]And my indicator starts to glow - wooo
[00:48.91]I'm just a love machine
[00:51.16]And I won't work for nobody but you,
[00:55.44]I'm just a love machine,
[00:59.00]A huggin', kissin' fiend.
[01:00.87]Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo
[01:07.99]Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah
[01:15.49]I'm just a love machine
[01:17.72]And I won't work for nobody but you,
[01:22.11]I'm just a love machine,
[01:25.59]A huggin', kissin' fiend.
[01:27.93]I'm gentle as a lamb,
[01:29.65]I'm not that hard to program,
[01:31.89]There's no way that you can lose,
[01:34.68]My chassis fits like a glove,
[01:36.57]I've got a button for love,
[01:38.35]That you have got-to-use.
[01:41.55]If you look into my file,
[01:44.91]I am sure you can find out how,
[01:47.96]To turn me on just set my dial,
[01:50.73]And let me love you for a little while - ooh
[01:54.47]I'm just a love machine
[01:57.39]And I won't work for nobody but you,
[02:02.20]I'm just a love machine,
[02:05.43]A huggin', kissin' fiend.
[02:07.36]Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo
[02:14.60]Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah
[02:22.79]I'm just a love machine
[02:25.79]And I won't work for nobody but you.

[02:47.10]A huggin' kissin' fiend.
[02:49.71]I'm just a love machine
[02:53.00]And I won't work for nobody but you.
[02:56.91]I'm just a love machine
[03:00.51]A huggin' kissin' fiend.
[03:03.53]I'm just a love machine
[03:05.91]And I won't work for nobody but you.
