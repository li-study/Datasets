[00:11.03]I'm only seventeen
[00:13.19]The many years between us
[00:15.96]Have been broken
[00:18.38]Look at me,under the ever green
[00:22.32]Life is a mellow dream
[00:24.93]Almost unspoken
[00:27.63]By the way
[00:29.31]You said you're here to stay
[00:31.98]Let me love you till tomorrow
[00:36.65]Then it will last a year and a day
[00:41.31]Maybe we're here to forget

[00:45.90]Look at me, I'm only seventeen

[01:08.51]I will love you till tomorrow
[01:13.24]Then it will last a year and a day
[01:17.78]Maybe we're here to forget
[01:21.77]
[01:59.37]Look at me, I'm only seventeen
[02:03.13]It hasn't been too long
[02:05.67]But it's been lonely
[02:08.16]Look at me, under the ever green
[02:12.05]Life is a mellow song
[02:14.94]If only only...
