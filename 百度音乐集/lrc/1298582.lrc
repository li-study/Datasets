[00:06.31]
[00:15.31]Aquarius, was born the night
[00:22.76]The shining stars
[00:27.10]Needed brighter shining light
[00:30.26]Aquarius was my savior
[00:37.56]It came along
[00:41.98]Like a blast from out of sight
[00:44.82]When I was weak
[00:48.44]U came along
[00:52.20]Enlightened me
[00:55.94]Covered the sun
[01:00.13]U seduced me
[01:04.01]I can never ever run
[01:07.89]Cause I can. Only lose 
[01:15.43]When I'm  Aquarius 
[01:21.98]U're the power that I need
[01:25.21]To make it all succeed
[01:28.87]Can hear me call
[01:31.96]
[01:36.64]Aquarius,is the stardust
[01:43.99]It kills the faith And the only one I trust
[01:51.31]It calls Ur name And U listen
[01:58.62]It steals Ur soul
[02:03.19]And Ur hunger  Ur lust
[02:06.84]For life And being free
[02:13.62]It's dragging U
[02:17.30]it's killing me
[02:21.33]U seduced me
[02:25.37]I can never ever run
[02:29.10]Cause I can. Only lose
[02:36.71]When I'm  Aquarius 
[02:43.34]U're the power that I need
[02:46.53]To make it all succeed
[02:50.19]Can U hear me call
[02:53.82]Can U hear me call
[02:56.94]
[03:02.98]I wish the stars would turn U in
[03:06.67]And leave me standing in the wind
[03:10.78]I wish the devil gave U up
[03:14.20]And all the snow would melt & stop
[03:18.50]This is it,I can't run away
[03:25.96]U're controlling my life
[03:29.67]And I can hear me say
[03:34.70]Cause I can. Only lose
[03:39.61]When I'm  Aquarius
[03:46.21]U're the power that I need
[03:49.54]To make it all succeed
[03:54.96]I wish the stars would turn U in
[03:58.54]And leave me standing in the wind
[04:02.54]I wish the devil gave U up
[04:06.42]And all the snow would melt  stop
