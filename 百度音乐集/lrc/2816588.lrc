[00:35.54]I am the key to the lock in your house
[00:42.54]That keeps your toys in the basement
[00:48.01]And if you get too far inside
[00:53.99]You'll only see my reflection
[00:59.25]
[01:03.57]It's always best when the light is off
[01:10.45]I am in the pick of the ice
[01:18.04]Do not cry out or hit the alarm
[01:23.50]You know we're friends till we die
[01:28.15]
[01:30.21]And either way you turn
[01:33.20]I'll be there
[01:36.50]Open up your skull
[01:38.90]I'll be there
[01:42.43]Climbing up the walls
[01:50.45]
[01:56.55]It's always best when the light is off
[02:01.01]It's always better on the outside
[02:07.94]Fifteen blows to the back of your head
[02:14.63]Fifteen blows to your mind
[02:20.17]
[02:24.25]So lock the kids up safe tonight
[02:30.32]Put the eyes in the cupboard
[02:35.70]I've got the smell of a local man
[02:42.46]Who's got the loneliest feeling
[02:48.18]
[02:48.92]That either way he turns
[02:51.86]I'll be there
[02:54.48]Open up your skull
[02:57.14]I'll be there
[03:00.48]
[03:01.13]Climbing up the walls
[03:43.25]Climbing up the walls
[03:55.25]Climbing up the walls
