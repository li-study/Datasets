[00:08.09]
[00:17.17]I was walking along in the sun
[00:21.32]Taking pictures of everyone
[00:25.57]And there's something on the tip of my tongue
[00:28.91]Oh oh oh oh
[00:34.22]Well it's easy to see from the far
[00:38.56]And it's easy to be on your guard
[00:42.84]But it's harder just to be who you are
[00:46.07]Oh oh oh oh
[00:49.07]
[00:49.50]When all these people who will lead you down
[00:54.06]The back of the track
[00:55.68]They're on your back
[00:57.46]They will try and tear you apart
[01:00.30]But believe and you will see
[01:02.02]That there's no reason to doubt
[01:04.47]Then you will find
[01:06.07]You can do much better than that
[01:10.88]
[01:17.64]If you think of all the things that you feel
[01:21.77]All the voices in your head that you hear
[01:26.01]It's a mystery that we are all still holding on
[01:32.42]
[01:32.92]When all these people who will lead you down
[01:37.34]The back of the track
[01:39.13]They're on your back
[01:40.83]They will try and tear you apart
[01:43.65]But believe and you will see
[01:45.30]That there's no reason to doubt
[01:47.83]Then you will find
[01:49.41]You can do much better than that
[01:54.31]
[02:19.89]If you see me hit the ground
[02:28.34]Don't come near, don't make a sound
[02:35.15]
[02:35.42]I was walking along in the sun
[02:39.77]Taking pictures of everyone
[02:44.07]And there's something on the tip of my tongue
