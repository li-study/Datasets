[00:11.22]Somewhere there's speaking
[00:13.76]It's already coming in
[00:16.85]Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
[00:21.36]You never could get it
[00:23.96]Unless you were fed it
[00:26.51]Now you're here and you don't know why
[00:31.23]But under skinned knees and the skid marks
[00:37.03]Past the places where you used to learn
[00:41.77]You howl and listen
[00:44.29]Listen and wait for the
[00:46.91]Echoes of angels who won't return
[00:50.95][01:42.06][02:47.17]He's everything you want
[00:53.39][01:44.40][02:49.53]He's everything you need
[00:55.82][01:47.24][02:52.07]He's everything inside of you
[00:58.86][01:50.06][02:55.05][03:15.35]That you wish you could be
[01:00.91][01:52.12][02:57.12]He says all the right things
[01:03.44][01:54.55][02:59.66][03:20.19]At exactly the right time
[01:05.89][01:57.51][03:02.68]But he means nothing to you
[01:08.84][01:59.87][03:05.05]And you don't know why
[01:22.37]You're waiting for someone
[01:25.21]To put you together
[01:27.73]You're waiting for someone to push you away
[01:32.56]There's always another wound to discover
[01:37.83]There's always something more you wish he'd say
[02:04.45]But you'll just sit tight
[02:06.57]And watch it unwind
[02:09.15]It's only what you're asking for
[02:14.34]And you'll be just fine
[02:16.77]With all of your time
[02:19.49]It's only what you're waiting for
[02:28.13]Out of the island
[02:30.36]Into the highway
[02:33.02]Past the places where you might have turned
[02:37.68]You never did notice
[02:40.54]But you still hide away
[02:43.08]The anger of angels who won't return
[03:07.75]I am everything you want
[03:10.14]I am everything you need
[03:12.67]I am everything inside of you
[03:17.67]I say all the right things
[03:23.05]But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
[03:33.13]And I don't know why
[03:35.76][03:38.00]Why
[03:41.97]I don't know
