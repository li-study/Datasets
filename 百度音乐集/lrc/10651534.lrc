[02:23.20]Oh when the cold wind blows
[02:30.98]I feel it to the bone
[02:38.13]Oh when you say you know
[02:45.27]I feel I am not alone
[02:48.68]
[03:21.05]You and I
[03:24.52]Truth and lies
[03:27.87]I have been fooling myself too long
[03:34.84]You and I

[04:54.20]Your mouth against my skin
[05:01.32]My world just froze away

[05:47.96]Truth and lies
[05:51.50]I have been fooling myself too long
