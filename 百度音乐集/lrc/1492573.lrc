[00:01.20]My Heart Belongs To Me
[00:08.06]-Barbra Streisand
[00:13.06]
[00:15.32]I got the feeling the feeling's gone
[00:22.12]My heart has gone to sleep
[00:29.67]One of these mornings I'll be gone
[00:36.05]My heart belongs to me
[00:41.56]
[00:43.17]Can we believe in fairy tales?
[00:50.33]Can love survive when all else fails?
[00:56.69]Can't hide the feeling the feeling's gone
[01:04.50]My heart belongs to me
[01:08.08]
[01:08.96]But now my love, hey didn't I love you
[01:16.67]But we knew what had to be
[01:22.82]Some how my love I'll always love you
[01:30.21]But my heart belongs to me
[01:36.08]
[01:42.08]Put out the light and close your eyes
[01:49.28]Come lie beside me, don't ask why
[01:55.28]Can't hide the feeling the feeling's gone
[02:02.69]My heart belongs to me
[02:06.40]
[02:07.56]But now my love, hey didn't I love you
[02:13.48]Didn't I love you, didn't I love you,
[02:17.02]Didn't I love you, baby!
[02:20.56]Don't cry my love, I'll always love you
[02:28.33]But my heart belongs to me
[02:36.28]My heart belongs to me
[02:42.73]
[02:44.73]I got the feeling the feeling's gone
[02:52.16]My heart belongs to me...
