[00:18.87]I've kissed the moon a million times
[00:23.52]Danced with angels in the sky
[00:28.08]I've seen snowfall in the summertime
[00:32.94]Felt the healing of the powers above
[00:37.57]I've seen the world from he highest mountain
[00:42.09]Tasted love from the purest fountain
[00:46.64]I've seen lips that spark desire
[00:51.18]Felt the butterflies a hundred times
[00:55.74]I've even seen miracles
[01:00.36]I've felt the pain disappear
[01:04.69]But still haven't seen anything
[01:09.21]That amazes me quite like you do
[01:12.73]Chorus:
[01:14.71]You bring me up when I'm feeling down
[01:19.43]You touch me deep you touch me right
[01:24.24]You do the things I've never done
[01:28.79]You make me wicked you make me wild
[01:32.94]'Cause baby, your my #1
[01:38.40]…… ……
[01:47.49]I've sailed in a perfect dream
[01:51.92]I've seen the sun make love to the sea
[01:56.96]I've kissed the moon a million times
[02:01.60]Danced with angels in the sky
[02:05.85]I've even seen miracles
[02:10.56]I've seen the tears disappear
[02:14.88]But still haven't seen anything
[02:19.35]That amazes me quite like you do
[02:24.93]You bring me up when I'm feeling down
[02:29.54]You touch me deep you touch me right
