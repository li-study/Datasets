
[00:21.00]This romeo is bleeding
[00:25.00]But you can't see his blood
[00:28.00]It's nothing but some feelings
[00:30.00]That this old dog kicked up
[00:35.00]It's been raining since you left me
[00:37.00]Now I'm drowning in the flood
[00:41.00]You see I've always been a fighter
[00:44.00]But without you I give up
[00:48.00]Now I can't sing a love song
[00:51.00]Like the way it's meant to be
[00:54.00]Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
[00:58.00]But baby, that's just me
[04:02.00][01:01.00]And I will love you, baby - Always
[04:15.00][01:14.00]And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
[04:30.00][01:29.00]I'll be there till the stars don't shine
[04:33.00][01:32.00]Till the heavens burst and
[04:35.00][01:34.00]The words don't rhyme
[04:36.00][01:35.00]And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
[04:40.00][01:39.00]And I'll love you - Always
[01:49.00]Now your pictures that you left behind
[01:52.00]Are just memories of a different life
[01:55.00]Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
[01:59.00]One that made you have to say goodbye
[02:02.00]What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
[02:06.00]To touch your lips, to hold you near
[02:09.00]When you say your prayers try to understand
[02:13.00]I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
[02:16.00]When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
[02:19.00]When he says the words you've been needing to hear
[02:22.00]I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
[02:26.00]To say to you till the end of time
[02:30.00]Yeah, I will love you baby - Always
[02:42.00]And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
[02:57.00]If you told me to cry for you
[03:02.00]I could
[03:04.00]If you told me to die for you
[03:09.00]I would
[03:11.00]Take a look at my face
[03:14.00]There's no price I won't pay
[03:20.00]To say these words to you
[03:49.00]Well, there ain't no luck
[03:51.00]In these loaded dice
[03:53.00]But baby if you give me just one more try
[03:56.00]We can pack up our old dreams
[03:58.00]And our old lives
[03:59.00]We'll find a place where the sun still shines
