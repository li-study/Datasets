[00:02.00]MercyMe - Word Of God Speak
[00:11.00]
[00:12.58]I'm finding myself at a loss for words
[00:19.12]And the funny thing is it's okay
[00:25.60]The last thing I need is to be heard
[00:32.76]But to hear what You would say
[00:38.90]
[00:39.99]Word of God speak
[00:42.37]Would You pour down like rain
[00:45.79]Washing my eyes to see
[00:50.06]Your majesty
[00:53.54]To be still and know
[00:56.09]That You're in this place
[00:59.58]Please let me stay and rest
[01:03.77]In Your holiness
[01:07.06]Word of God speak
[01:10.25]
[01:20.85]I'm finding myself in the midst of You
[01:27.65]Beyond the music, beyond the noise
[01:33.83]All that I need is to be with You
[01:41.51]And in the quiet hear Your voice
[01:47.04]
[01:47.88]Word of God speak
[01:50.64]Would You pour down like rain
[01:54.45]Washing my eyes to see
[01:58.53]Your majesty
[02:01.70]To be still and know
[02:04.77]That You're in this place
[02:07.90]Please let me stay and rest
[02:12.14]In Your holiness
[02:14.27]
[02:15.56]Word of God speak
[02:18.43]Would You pour down like rain
[02:21.82]Washing my eyes to see
[02:25.71]Your majesty
[02:29.25]To be still and know
[02:31.91]That You're in this place
[02:35.51]Please let me stay and rest
[02:39.73]In Your holiness
[02:44.11]
[02:45.92]I'm finding myself at a loss for words
[02:53.51]And the funny thing is it's okay
