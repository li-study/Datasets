[00:00.00]James Blunt - Billy
[00:12.50]
[00:14.50]Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
[00:20.53]Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).
[00:26.55]He knows the price that he's paid.
[00:29.55]He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.
[00:37.13]Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
[00:43.18]The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
[00:49.50]Old doors are closed but he's always open,
[00:55.22]To relive time in his mind.
[01:01.02]Oh Billy.
[01:02.00]
[01:14.95]Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
[01:20.99]He's got lines on his face
[01:23.78](they tell the story of his pain).
[01:27.08]He accepts it's his fate.
[01:30.10]He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.
[01:37.65]Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
[01:43.66]The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
[01:50.01]Old doors are closed but he's always open,
[01:55.67]To relive time in his mind.
[02:01.46]Oh Billy.
[02:02.45]
[02:26.50][02:14.53]Once he was a lover sleeping with another.
[02:29.40][02:17.49]Now he's just known as a cheat.
[02:32.09][02:20.04]And he wish he'd had a mirror;looked a little clearer.
[02:35.55][02:23.49]Seen into the eyes of the weak.
[02:37.73]
[02:38.09]Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
[02:44.17]The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
[02:50.52]Old doors are closed but he's always open,
[02:56.12]To relive time in his mind.
[03:01.95]Oh Billy.
