[00:00.79]Top Of The World
[00:02.84]Carpenters
[00:05.19]
[00:17.54]Such a feelin's comin' over me
[00:21.95]There is wonder in most everthing I see
[00:27.10]Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
[00:32.97]and I won't be surprised if it's a dream
[00:38.54]Everything I want the world to be
[00:42.65]Is now coming true especially for me
[00:47.88]and the reason is clear
[00:51.06]It's because you are here
[00:53.90]You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
[00:58.41]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[01:03.70]and the only explanation I can find
[01:08.57]Is the love that I've found
[01:11.95]Ever since  you've been around
[01:13.92]Your loves put me at the top of the world
[01:17.91]
[01:25.13]Something in the wind has learned my name
[01:29.35]And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
[01:34.47]In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
[01:40.25]There is a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
[01:46.04]There is only one wish on my mind
[01:50.30]When this day is through I hope that I will find
[01:55.29]that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
[02:01.00]All I need will be mine if you are here
[02:05.86]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[02:11.26]and the only explanation I can find
[02:15.86]Is the love that I've found
[02:18.97]Ever since  you've been around
[02:21.36]Your loves put me at the top of the world
[02:26.44]I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
[02:30.76]and the only explanation I can find
[02:36.62]Is the love that I've found
[02:39.83]Ever since  you've been around
[02:41.90]Your loves put me at the top of the world
