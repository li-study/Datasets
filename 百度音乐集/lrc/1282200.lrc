[00:01.00]Is this the real life -
[00:03.00]Is this just fantasy -
[00:07.00]Caught in a landslide -
[00:10.00]No escape from reality -
[00:14.00]Open your eyes
[00:17.00]Look up to the skies and see -
[00:24.00]I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy -
[00:31.00]Because I'm easy come, easy go,
[00:35.00]A little high, little low,
[00:38.00]Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,
[00:47.00]- to me -,
[00:55.00]Mama, just killed a man,
[01:01.00]Put a gun against his head,
[01:04.00]Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
[01:08.00]Mama, life had just begun,
[01:15.00]But now I've gone and thrown it all away -
[01:22.00]Mama, ooo,
[01:29.00]Didn't mean to make you cry -
[01:32.00]If I'm not back again this time tomorrow -
[01:37.00]Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters -
[01:54.00]Too late, my time has come,
[02:01.00]Sends shivers down my spine,
[02:04.00]Body's aching all the time,
[02:08.00]Goodbye everybody - I've got to go -
[02:14.00]Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth -
[02:21.00]Mama, ooo -
[02:28.00]I don't want to die,
[02:32.00]I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all -
[03:05.00]I see a little silhouetto of a man,
[03:08.00]Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the Fandango -
[03:12.00]Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me -
[03:15.00]Galileo, Galileo,
[03:17.00]Galileo, Galileo
[03:19.00]Galileo figaro - Magnifico -
[03:22.00]But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me -
[03:25.00]He's just a poor boy from a poor family -
[03:28.00]Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
[03:33.00]Easy come easy go -, will you let me go -
[03:36.00]Bismillah! No -, we will not let you go - let him go -
[03:40.00]Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
[03:43.00]Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
[03:46.00]Will not let you go - let me go
[03:48.00]Will not let you go - let me go
[03:51.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
[03:53.00]Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go -
[03:57.00]Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me -
[04:03.00]for me -
[04:15.00]So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye -
[04:21.00]So you think you can love me and leave me to die -
[04:26.00]Oh Baby - Can't do this to me baby -
[04:33.00]Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here -
[05:11.00]Nothing really matters,
[05:15.00]Anyone can see,
[05:18.00]Nothing really matters -, nothing really matters to me
[05:43.00]Any way the wind blows...
