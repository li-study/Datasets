[00:03.52]猫咪回来吧，狗狗一直在等你
[00:28.77]
[00:29.77]I hear a baby crying,
[00:35.93]A sad sound, a lonely sound.
[00:43.83]I want to take her in my arms
[00:49.27]and then I dry away all her tears.
[00:56.99]
[00:58.11]I see a boy who's frightened,
[01:04.14]A young boy with cold eyes,
[01:12.11]I long to say you're welcome here
[01:17.40]you can be happy now that you're warm.
[01:25.61]
[01:26.42]We're all a part of one world,
[01:32.95]We all can share the same dream...
[01:39.36]And if you just reach out to me,
[01:43.22]Then you will find deep down inside
[01:49.13]I'm just like you.
[01:54.17]
[01:55.91]Loud voices raised in anger,
[02:01.20]Speak harsh words, such cruel words,
[02:08.29]Why do they speak so selfishly?
[02:13.02]When we have got so much we can share.
[02:20.42]
[02:20.80]So let your hearts be open,
[02:26.33]And reach out with all your love,
[02:34.67]There are no strangers now,
[02:37.78]They are our brothers now,
[02:40.83]And we are one.
[02:45.25]
[02:45.56]We're all apart of one world,
[02:51.53]We all can share the same dream,
[02:57.69]And if you just reach out to me,
[03:01.61]Then you will find, deep down inside
[03:07.21]I'm just like you....
[03:10.10]
[03:10.54]We're all apart of one world,
[03:16.61]We all can share the same dream,
[03:22.64]And if you just reach out to me,
[03:26.44]Then you will find, deep down inside...
[03:32.04]I'm just like you....
[03:35.15]I'm just like you....
