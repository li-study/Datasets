[00:02.00]Mastodon - Oblivion
[00:07.00]
[00:58.57]I flew beyond the sun before it was time
[01:04.59]Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
[01:10.52]Waiting for you to pull me back in
[01:14.96]I almost had the world in my sight
[01:18.17]
[01:18.82]Lost love, bright eyes fading
[01:24.58]Faster than stars falling
[01:29.63]How can I tell you that I've failed?
[01:38.57]Tell you I failed
[01:39.82]
[01:40.56]Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
[01:47.58]Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
[01:54.07]Now I'm lost in oblivion
[01:59.77]
[02:00.57]I tried to burrow a hole into the ground
[02:05.77]Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hand
[02:11.94]The eyes of a child see no wrong
[02:16.61]Ignorant bliss, impending doom
[02:20.50]
[02:21.22]Lost love, bright eyes fading
[02:26.56]Faster than stars falling
[02:31.15]How can I tell you that I've failed?
[02:40.51]Tell you I failed
[02:41.69]
[02:42.50]Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
[02:49.76]Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
[02:56.39]Now I'm lost
[03:00.34]
[03:01.14]Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
[03:07.31]Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
[03:15.01]Now I'm lost in oblivion
[03:21.59]
[04:41.53]Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
[04:49.00]Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
[04:56.25]Now I'm lost
[04:59.05]
[04:59.93]Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
[05:06.87]Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
[05:14.61]Now I'm lost in oblivion, in oblivion, in oblivion
[05:41.38]
