[00:06.56]
[00:18.84]It's all about you (it's all about you)
[00:22.62]It's all about you baby
[00:26.34]It's all about you (it's all about you)
[00:29.69]It's all about you
[00:32.12]
[00:33.25]Yesterday you asked me something I thought you knew
[00:39.46]So I told you with a smile, it's all about you
[00:47.65]Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
[00:54.30]That you made my life worthwhile, it's all about you
[01:01.07]
[01:02.78]And I would answer all of your wishes
[01:06.66]If you ask me to
[01:09.72]But if you leave I need one of your kisses
[01:14.21]Don't know what I'd do
[01:18.05]So hold me close and say three words like you used to do
[01:24.12]Dancing on the kitchen tiles, it's all about you, yeah!
