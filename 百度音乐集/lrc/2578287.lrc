[00:14.20]by:pUpU
[00:28.94]Teardrop on a fragile eyelash
[00:34.42]She's looking like a dream
[00:37.39]Hoping for some understanding
[00:42.01]And answer or at least
[00:45.94]Cunning word a single sentence
[00:51.15]To restore her heart
[00:55.55]Aching since the day I left her
[01:00.51]Crossing lonely seas
[01:03.67]Silent tears of a woman
[01:06.40]Make a warrior cry
[01:08.71]Heaven, I beg you
[01:14.71]Please release hopes from fears
[01:23.09]This is my elegy
[01:25.91]Do you know what I feel?
[01:29.42]This is my elegy
[01:33.17]Do you believe it's real?
[01:40.53]Will I hold you in my arms again?
[01:48.31]Dewdrops on a single rosebud
[01:51.42]This purity of rain
[01:53.09]Reminds me of the moment I left her
[01:57.70]Kisses filled with pain
[02:02.43]And if I should leave her waiting
[02:07.22]For another year
[02:11.71]Will she ever know the answer?
[02:16.22]Will she follow me?
[02:21.24]Silent tears of a woman
[02:23.81]Make her warrior cry
[02:27.64]Heaven, I beg you
[02:31.49]Please release hopes from fears
[04:00.62][03:43.33][02:39.47]This is my elegy
[04:05.80][03:47.82][02:43.21]Do you know what I feel?
[04:10.68][03:51.03][02:46.65]This is my elegy
[04:12.23][03:56.34][02:50.97]Do you believe it's real?
[04:18.51][02:54.47]Will I hold you in my arms..
[04:23.15][03:02.17]Hold you in my arms again?
[00:21.74]
[03:25.96]Cunning word, a single sentence
[03:28.76]To restore her heart
[03:31.70]Aching since the day I left her
[03:36.95]Crossing lonely seas
