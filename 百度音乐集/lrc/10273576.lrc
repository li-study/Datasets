[00:07.00]
[00:20.87]I've got an angel
[00:25.51]She doesn't wear any wings
[00:31.29]She wears a heart that could melt my own
[00:34.67]She wears a smile that could make me want to sing
[00:39.83]
[00:42.65]She gives me presents
[00:47.07]With her presence alone
[00:53.81]She gives me everything I could wish for
[00:56.49]She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
[01:01.86]
[01:04.68]She can make angels
[01:08.84]I've seen it with my own eyes
[01:15.46]You got to be careful when you you've got good love
[01:18.35]Cause them angels will just keep on multiplying
[01:23.65]
[01:26.80]You're so busy changing the world
[01:31.05]Just one smile can change all of mine
[01:36.30]We share the same soul
[01:39.06]Oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
[01:41.90]We Share the same soul
[01:44.58]Oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
