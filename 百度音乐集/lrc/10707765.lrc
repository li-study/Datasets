[00:00.00]Broken Wings
[00:06.00]Evergrey
[00:12.00]Torn
[00:16.00]
[00:49.41]From loss into embrace
[00:52.64]I fled the fear and the dark of day
[00:56.11]Like an angel of falen grace
[00:59.53]My broken wings can't hold my weight
[01:02.99]I came so clos that I felt the flames
[01:06.35]I came so close that i'll never be safe again
[01:09.93]I'd give anything to find a way to leave the fear and evacuate
[01:17.04]
[01:17.18]Come reach inside my inner fear
[01:20.09]Come feel my sorrow and my tears
[01:23.75]My broken wings can't hold my weight
[01:27.04]Through the dark of day
[01:28.74]
[01:30.62]Leave that guilt-stained cross behind
[01:33.81]Free your arms do it one by one
[01:37.32]It's not your fault you are not to blame
[01:40.48]Your wing-clipped past should not bring you shame
[01:44.10]And the years that you still endured
[01:47.41]Should work as strenght to see past it all
[01:50.55]
[01:51.06]Come reach inside my inner fear
[01:54.34]Come feel my sorrow and my tears
[01:57.86]My broken wings can't hold my weight
[02:01.10]Through the dark of day
[02:04.70]All hope's been burnt to ashes
[02:07.97]And I'm so tired to hiding the bruises
[02:11.48]My broken wings can't take me
[02:14.54]Through the dark of day
[02:18.14]
[02:18.51]Deep cuts will not help you heal
[02:21.74]The pain inflicted's just false relief
[02:25.40]Precious moments where you can dream
[02:28.28]Of a day when you too can feel
[02:33.36]
[03:27.15]Come reach inside my inner fear
[03:30.39]Come feel my sorrow and my tears
[03:33.85]My broken wings can't hold my weight
[03:37.08]Through the dark of day
[03:40.71]All hope's been burnt to ashes
[03:43.84]And I'm so tired to hiding the bruises
[03:47.47]My broken wings can't take me
[03:50.44]Through the dark of day ......
