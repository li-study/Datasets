[00:01.12]Green Day - Restless Heart Syndrome
[00:02.44]
[00:13.60]I've got a really bad disease
[00:19.79]It's got me begging
[00:22.11]On my hands and knees
[00:24.80]Take me to the emergency
[00:31.50]'Cause something seems to be missing
[00:36.02]
[00:37.25]Somebody take the pain away
[00:43.15]It's like an ulcer bleeding in my brain
[00:48.56]Send me to the pharmacy
[00:54.77]So I can lose my memory
[01:01.10]I'm elated
[01:03.99]Medicated
[01:06.68]Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away.
[01:17.52]
[01:18.27]I think they found another cure
[01:24.08]For broken hearts and feeling insecure
[01:29.23]You'd be surprised what I endure
[01:35.78]What make you feel so self-assured?
[01:40.61]
[01:41.69]I need to find a place to hide
[01:47.56]You never know what could be
[01:50.86]Waiting outside
[01:52.83]The accidnets that you could find
[01:59.21]It's like some kind of suicide
[02:03.87]
[02:05.32]So what ails you is what impales you
[02:11.04]I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied
[02:21.80]
[02:23.02]I'm a victim of my symptom
[02:28.59]I am my own worst enemy
[02:34.35]You're a victim of you're symptom
[02:40.27]You are your own worst enemy
[02:44.22]Know your enemy
[03:05.17]
[03:09.00]I'm elated
[03:11.98]Medicated
[03:14.16]I am my own worst enemy
[03:19.80]So what ails you is what impales you
[03:25.14]You are your own worse enemy
[03:30.48]You're a victim of the system
[03:36.07]You are your own worst enemy
[03:41.68]You're a victim of the system
[03:46.94]You are your own worst enemy
[04:02.93]
