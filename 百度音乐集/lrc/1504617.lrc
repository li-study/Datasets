[00:21]I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
[00:31]All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity
[00:42]Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.
[00:52]Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
[01:02]All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see
[01:13]Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
[02:11][Now] Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
[02:21]It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy.
[02:33]Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
[02:42]Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.
