[00:05.35]Lyrics :
[00:06.56]
[00:17.19]I'm 15 for a moment
[00:20.81]Caught in between 10 and 20
[00:24.51]And I'm just dreaming
[00:26.57]Counting the ways to where you are
[00:31.39]
[00:32.77]I'm 22 for a moment
[00:36.50]She feels better than ever
[00:40.20]And we're on fire
[00:43.14]Making our way back from Mars
[00:47.39]
[00:49.09]15 there's still time for you
[00:53.03]Time to buy and time to lose
[00:56.94]15, there's never a wish better than this
[01:04.12]When you only got 100 years to live
[01:09.32]
[01:16.88]I'm 33 for a moment
[01:20.58]Still the man, but you see I'm a they
[01:24.35]A kid on the way
[01:26.80]A family on my mind
[01:30.87]
[01:32.43]I'm 45 for a moment
[01:36.22]The sea is high
[01:38.44]And I'm heading into a crisis
[01:42.90]Chasing the years of my life
[01:47.35]
[01:48.70]15 there's still time for you
[01:52.07]Time to buy, Time to lose yourself
[01:57.43]Within a morning star
[02:00.45]
[02:04.30]15 I'm all right with you
[02:07.98]15, there's never a wish better than this
[02:15.32]When you only got 100 years to live
[02:20.29]
[02:20.60]Half time goes by
[02:21.84]Suddenly you're wise
[02:23.81]Another blink of an eye
[02:25.52]67 is gone
[02:27.51]The sun is getting high
[02:29.71]We're moving on...
[02:34.05]
[02:39.71]I'm 99 for a moment
[02:43.24]Dying for just another moment
[02:46.88]And I'm just dreaming
[02:49.88]Counting the ways to where you are
[02:54.11]
[02:55.57]15 there's still time for you
[02:59.40]22 I feel her too
[03:03.48]33 you're on your way
[03:07.48]Every day's a new day...
[03:10.81]
[03:27.48]15 there's still time for you
[03:30.93]Time to buy and time to choose
[03:35.02]Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this
[03:42.50]When you only got 100 years to live
[03:47.75]
