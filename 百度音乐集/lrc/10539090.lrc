[00:01.12]Lee DeWyze - Dear Isabelle
[00:05.89]
[00:10.57]I found this faded picture of you and me on Lake Michigan
[00:14.71]you were smiling, the wind was blowing in your hair
[00:19.58]I think it's been around 5 years,
[00:21.95]and everything and nothing's changed
[00:25.24]God, I wish that you were here
[00:28.02]I know I should have called
[00:30.07]I know I should have stayed
[00:32.45]I should have said a lot of things
[00:34.77]I hope it's not too late
[00:37.80]
[00:39.04]Dear Isabelle, been thinkin' about you
[00:43.72]Dear Isabelle, so lonely without you
[00:48.46]I pretended I was doing well,
[00:51.98]but without you, it's been hell, Dear Isabelle
[00:58.55]
[01:01.99]Sometimes I'm not good with words,
[01:04.21]but you knew that so I wrote this verse
[01:06.65]in hopes that it would someday reach your ears
[01:11.41]and I still wonder where you are ,
[01:13.60]but it doesn't matter cause it's still too far
[01:16.74]The lake has never looked so clear
[01:19.56]I know I should have called
[01:21.88]I know I should have stayed
[01:24.27]I should have said a lot of things
[01:26.49]I hope it's not too late
[01:28.72]
[01:30.73]Dear Isabelle, been thinkin' about you
[01:35.40]Dear Isabelle, so lonely without you
[01:40.26]I pretended I was doing well,
[01:42.44]but without you, it's been hell, Dear Isabelle
[01:50.27]
[01:51.24]It's hard for me to write this,
[01:53.51]Is it hard for you to know that I still care?
[02:00.36]Would it kill you to forgive me?
[02:02.62]Come on, Isabelle, I know that you're out there
[02:09.03]I know I should have called
[02:11.19]I know I should have stayed
[02:13.55]I should have said a lot of things
[02:15.85]I hope it's not too late
[02:18.12]
[02:20.08]Dear Isabelle, been thinkin' about you
[02:24.77]Dear Isabelle, so lonely without you
[02:29.46]I pretended I was doing well,
[02:32.69]but without you, it's been hell, Dear Isabelle
[02:41.36]
