[00:03.81]A new beggining a new chapter of my life
[00:11.10]Started the day when I thought it could be my last
[00:17.23]My eyes were wide shut but I hadn't given up
[00:23.86]Just thought I'd be walking the world alone
[00:31.35]Out of the blue there I met you
[00:37.14]Showed me a life I can't see without you
[00:43.26]And there's just no way
[00:46.38]That I can't fight these emotions
[00:51.15]Your energy running through me
[00:54.28]Nobody can renew me like you
[00:59.47]Out of the blue can this be true?
[01:10.00]Family and friends they were my life
[01:13.59]I wasn't one for butterflies
[01:16.43]But you give me love that I can't disguise
[01:22.69]There will be times when were apart
[01:25.82]I want you to know your in my heart
[01:29.19]Growing into a beautiful garden
[01:36.33]No emotions my whole body felt like ice
[01:42.60]Needed to feel that the sun would shine my way
[01:48.64]My world had turned to dust
[01:51.30]But I had my faith and trust
[01:55.66]Thought I'd be walking the world alone
[02:07.88]Family and friends they were my life
[02:10.88]I wasn't one for butterflies
[02:14.12]But you give me love that I can't disguise
[02:20.14]There will be times when were apart
[02:23.41]I want you to know your in my heart
[02:26.63]Growing into a beautiful garden
[02:34.27]Out of the blue there I met you
[02:40.46]I can't believe that this happened so soon
[02:46.38]And there's just no way
[02:49.66]That i can fight these emotions
[02:54.52]Your energy running through me
