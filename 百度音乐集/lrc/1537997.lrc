[00:23.31]They say Taylor was a good girl, never one to be late
[00:25.84]complain, express ideas in her brain.
[00:34.24]Working on the night shift, passing out the tickets,
[00:35.72]You're gonna have to pay her if you want to park here.
[00:44.56]
[00:45.45]Well mommy's little dancer is quite a little secret
[00:46.85]Working on the streets now, never gonna keep it.
[00:56.41]It's quite an imposition and now she's only wishin
[00:59.05]That she would have listened to the words they said...Poor Taylor.
[01:07.30]
[01:08.39]She just wanders around, unaffected by,
[01:11.45]the winter winds air, she'll pretend that
[01:19.12]She's somewhere else, so far and clear
[01:24.38]about two thousand miles, from here.
[01:36.41]
[01:40.65]Well Peter Patrick pitter patters on the window,
[01:45.78]the sunny silhouette won't let him in.
[01:51.43]Poor old Pete's got nothing cuz he's been falling,
[01:57.10]And somehow sunny knows just where he's been.
[02:00.56]
[02:02.22]He thinks that singin on Sunday's gonna save his soul,
[02:07.87]now that Saturday's gone.
[02:13.16]And sometimes he thinks that he's on his way,
[02:18.39]but i can see, that his brake lights are on.
[02:25.41]
[02:25.86]He just wanders around, unaffected by,
[02:30.81]the winter winds air, and he'll pretend that,
[02:36.40]he's somewhere else, so far and clear,
[02:41.75]about two thousand miles...from here
[02:50.05]
[02:57.57]Such a tough enchilada, filled up with nada,
[03:02.42]givin what you gotta give to get a dollar bill.
[03:08.16]Used to be a limber chicken, times have been a ticking,
[03:10.10]now she's finger lickin to the man,
[03:14.87]With the money in his pocket, flying in his rocket,
[03:17.28]only stopping by on his way to a better world.
[03:21.08]
[03:24.28]If Taylor finds a better world, then Taylor's gonna run away.
