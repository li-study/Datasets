[00:20.69]While a force of nature is falling down to earth
[00:27.54]Seas of tears and sadness, no one knows my worth.
[00:34.08]No reason for existence, to be or not to be â€¦
[00:40.84]It's just a scene of madness, all the signs I was blind to see.
[00:50.80]
[01:32.94]Back on wasted places, the end of time's been reached
[01:39.63]covered human faces, I can't get no sleep.
[01:46.50]Like a force of nature pain is flooding me
[01:53.19]My scene of perdition, no reply to what it means to be
[02:02.82]
