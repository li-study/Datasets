[00:00.00]Perhaps Love
[00:06.22]Artists : Placido Domingo , John Denver
[00:12.62]
[00:15.96]Perhaps love is like a resting place
[00:19.80]A shelter from the storm
[00:22.69]It exists to give you comfort
[00:25.63]It is there to keep you warm
[00:28.67]And in those times of trouble
[00:32.03]When you are most alone
[00:34.61]The memory of love will bring you home
[00:40.05]
[00:41.05]Perhaps love is like a window
[00:44.30]Perhaps an open door
[00:47.21]It invites you to come closer
[00:50.38]It wants to show you more
[00:53.92]And even if you lose yourself
[00:56.69]and don't know what to do
[00:59.87]The memory of love will see you thru
[01:05.81]
[01:06.25]O love to some is like a cloud
[01:08.71]To some as strong as steel
[01:11.66]For some a way of living
[01:14.26]For some a way to feel
[01:17.55]And some say love is holding on
[01:20.07]And some say letting go
[01:22.99]And some say love is everything
[01:25.92]Some say they don't know
[01:28.91]
[01:31.24]Perhaps love is like the ocean
[01:34.79]Full of conflict full of pain
[01:37.62]Like a fire when it's cold outside
[01:40.74]A thunder when it rains
[01:43.36]If I should live forever
[01:46.51]And all my dreams come true
[01:49.49]My memories of love will be of you
[01:55.36]
[02:07.12]And some say love is holding on
[02:10.05]And some say letting go
[02:12.68]And some say love is everything
[02:15.44]Some say they don't know
[02:18.02]
[02:20.85]Perhaps love is like the ocean
[02:24.73]Full of conflict full of pain
[02:27.78]Like a fire when it's cold outside
[02:31.03]A thunder when it rains
[02:34.03]If I should live forever
[02:37.06]And all my dreams come true
[02:40.01]My memories of love will be of you
