[00:01.43]Moonlight Shadow
[00:07.50]Dana Winner
[00:12.63]
[00:25.21]The last that ever she saw him,
[00:29.29]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[00:33.12]He passed on worried and warning,
[00:36.81]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[00:40.53]Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
[00:44.22]far away on the other side,
[00:47.57]he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight,
[00:51.40]and she couldn't find how to push through.
[00:57.08]The trees that whisper in the evening,
[01:01.11]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[01:04.66]Sing the song of sorrow and grieving,
[01:08.57]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[01:12.35]All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
[01:16.09]far away on the other side,
[01:19.47]He was shot six times by a man on the run,
[01:23.09]and she couldn't find how to push through.
[01:29.83]I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,
[01:37.29]I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day.
[01:44.87]
[01:57.49]Four a.m. in the morning,
[02:01.17]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[02:04.90]I watched your vision forming,
[02:08.68]carried away by a moonlight shadow,
[02:12.33]Stars moving in silvery night,
[02:16.11]far away on the other side,
[02:19.49]Will you come to talk to me this night,
[02:23.26]but she couldn't find how to push through.
[02:29.87]I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,
[02:37.38]I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day.
[02:44.63]
[03:06.91]Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
[03:14.14]The night was heavy and the air was alive
[03:17.66]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:20.50]
[03:25.59]Far away on the other side.
[03:29.13]The night was heavy and the air was alive
[03:32.64]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:36.51]she couldn't find how to push through
[03:43.60]how to push through....
