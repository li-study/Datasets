[00:00.05]Fall Out Boy-XO
[00:00.23]
[00:00.42]I comb the crowd and pick you out
[00:04.12]My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
[00:07.16]It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
[00:11.07]"To I swear, I say"
[00:14.81]"To I swear, I say"
[00:17.92]
[00:18.17]To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
[00:22.04]To drinks at the club to the bar
[00:25.02]To the keys to your car
[00:26.84]To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door
[00:31.66]
[00:32.91]To the love, I left my conscience pressed
[00:38.00]Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
[00:42.39]"What did it ever do for me" I say (I say, I say, I say)
[00:47.98]It never calls me when I'm down
[00:52.57]Love never wanted me
[00:54.89]But I took it anyway
[00:57.12]Put your ear to the speaker
[00:59.99]And choose love or sympathy
[01:02.22]But never both
[01:06.88]Love never wanted me
[01:09.48]
[01:09.84]"I hoped you choked
[01:11.48]And crashed your car"
[01:13.13]Hey "tear catcher", that's all that you are
[01:16.55]And ever were
[01:19.07]From the start
[01:20.52]I swear, I say
[01:24.55]I swear, I say
[01:27.22]
[01:27.46]To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
[01:31.47]To drinks at the club to the bar
[01:34.42]To the keys to your car
[01:36.25]To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door
[01:41.14]
[01:42.48]To the love, I left my conscience pressed
[01:47.33]Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
[01:51.58]"What did it ever do for me" I say
[01:57.18]It never calls me when I'm down
[02:02.04]Love never wanted me
[02:04.35]But I took it anyway
[02:06.15]Put your ear to the speaker
[02:09.31]And choose love or sympathy
[02:10.84]But never both, no
[02:18.90]
[02:19.24]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[02:24.66]Through the keyhole I watched you dress
[02:27.33]Kiss and tell
[02:30.40](Loose lips sink ships)
[02:33.22]
[02:33.46]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[02:39.30]Through the keyholes I watched you dress
[02:42.04]Kiss and tell
[02:44.81](Loose lips sink ships)
[02:47.39]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[02:53.40]Through the keyholes I watched you dress
[02:55.71]Kiss and tell
[02:59.32](Loose lips sink ships)
[03:02.44]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[03:09.36]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[03:16.38]To the love I left my conscience pressed
[03:23.34]Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
[03:26.45]"What did it ever do for me" I say
