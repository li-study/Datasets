[00:00.92]Kiss Me
[00:20.08]Kiss me out of the bearded barley
[00:24.87]Nightly, beside the green, green grass
[00:30.61]Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
[00:35.51]You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
[00:39.05]Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
[00:44.73]Lead me out on the moonlit floor
[00:49.81]Lift up your open hand
[00:52.00]Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
[00:55.27]Silver moon's sparkling
[01:00.37]So kiss me
[01:11.68]Kiss me down by the broken tree house
[01:16.16]Swing me upon it's hanging tire
[01:21.00]Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat

[01:29.05]Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
[01:32.84]Lead me out on the moonlit floor
[01:40.42]Lift your open hand
[01:42.58]Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
[01:45.46]Silver moon's sparkling
[01:50.72]So kiss me
[02:11.29]Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
[02:15.74]Lead me out on the moonlit floor
[02:20.88]Lift your open hand
[02:23.13]Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
[02:26.32]Silver moon's sparkling
[02:31.78]So kiss me
[02:41.19]So Kiss me
