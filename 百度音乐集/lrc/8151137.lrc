[00:26.50]I lied just little
[00:30.50]When I said I need you
[00:33.50]You stretched the truth
[00:37.50]When you said that you knew
[00:40.50]Just can't believe it
[00:44.50]There's nothing to say
[00:47.50]I was almost honest, almost
[00:56.50]Living alone, can't stand this place
[01:04.50]It's four in the morning and I still see your face
[01:13.50]I was nearly pure
[01:16.50]When I said I love you

[02:18.50]I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice
[02:26.50]It happened that night when you told me to go
[02:33.50]Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know
[02:38.50]
[03:39.50][03:46.50]Almost, almost honest
[03:43.50][03:51.50]Almost, I was almost honest
