[00:01.81]Bianca Ryan - Dream In Color
[00:05.41]
[00:07.16]Ooh, Mmm~
[00:17.92]Tired of living life in black and white
[00:23.97]There’s so much in between
[00:29.66]Like a rainbow in the sky
[00:35.81]Crying to be seen
[00:40.61]When I open my eyes to find inspiration
[00:47.63]I search for the best I can see
[00:53.29]If I settle for less
[00:56.99]I won’t be the best I can be
[01:05.14]When I dream, I dream in color
[01:10.56]There is so much I want to discover
[01:18.16]I’ll give you so many good reasons
[01:23.19]To capture a dream, yeah, yeah
[01:30.66]Life is short, but can’t be bought, mmm
[01:36.25]And time is a very precious thing
[01:42.32]I want to go to where I’ve never been
[01:48.05]And see what’s never been seen
[01:52.68]In the midst of the morning I won’t take for granted
[02:00.10]There’ll always be another new day
[02:05.69]Got to live for each moment
[02:09.04]Never let time slip away
[02:17.33]When I dream, I dream in color
[02:22.68]There is so much I want to discover
[02:29.75]I’ll give you so many good reasons
[02:35.18]To capture a dream, whoa...
[03:11.43]When I dream, I dream in color
[03:16.67]There is so much I want to discover
[03:24.58]Show me a child who never has seen
