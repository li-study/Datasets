[00:03.31]Devics - In Your Room
[00:22.18]ZiShine
[00:34.90]In that room did you care
[00:39.41]I never knew anyone who stared at me
[00:44.26]Quite like the way your staring at me now
[00:53.12]And if all these empty words you speak
[00:58.22]Could change the boy who's at your feet
[01:02.36]I think you need not look farther than your arms
[01:09.34]
[01:10.97]Cause I'll never change
[01:20.04]And you'll stay the same
[01:29.16]And I'll never change
[01:36.55]
[01:51.47]If I could change the boy at my feet
[01:56.15]To a man who didn't have to speak
[02:00.87]I wouldn't have to use my arms to measure
[02:09.99]Something about the room that day
[02:14.09]And how I knew I'd go away
[02:18.55]How all I can do is stare at you
[02:23.16]And think what I'm about to do
[02:27.21]
[02:27.46]Cause I'll never change
[02:36.20]And you'll stay the same
[02:45.14]And I'll never change
[02:54.67]
[03:44.06]I stared at the light too long
[03:48.20]And I did everything to keep from falling
[03:52.72]When all is said and done
[03:55.77]Do you think it was worth it
[04:01.83]Patterns move across the floor
[04:05.80]And it just doesn't feel the same I'm sorry
[04:10.57]When all is said and done
[04:13.66]I think it was worth it
[04:17.26]
[04:19.14]Cause I'll never change
[04:28.13]And you'll stay the same
[04:37.20]And I'll never change
[04:46.32]
