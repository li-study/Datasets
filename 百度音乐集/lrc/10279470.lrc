[00:05.51]Lyric by Keith6
[01:04.47]So close, no matter how far
[01:09.96]Couldn't be much more from the heart
[01:15.14]Forever trusting who we are
[01:20.63]'cuz nothing else matters
[01:23.67]
[01:28.86]Never opened myself this way
[01:34.05]Life is ours, we live it our way
[01:39.72]All these words I  just don't say
[01:46.11]'cuz nothing else matters
[01:48.96]
[01:54.76]Never cared for what they do
[01:59.49]Never cared for what they know
[02:04.86]But I know
[02:06.37]
[02:11.72]So close, no matter how far
[02:17.50]Couldn't be much more from the heart
[02:22.64]Forever trusting who we are
[02:28.60]'cuz nothing else matters
[02:33.48]
[02:36.49]Never cared for what they do
[02:41.79]Never cared for what they know
[02:47.50]Never cared for what they do
[02:52.63]But I know
[02:57.77]
[02:59.52]Trust I seek and I find in you
[03:05.09]Every day for us, something new
[03:10.16]Open mind for a different view
[03:15.88]'cuz nothing else matters
[03:23.79]
[03:51.73]So close, no matter how far
[03:57.04]Couldn't be much more from the heart
[04:02.50]Forever trusting who we are
[04:07.99]'cuz nothing else matters
[04:14.57]'cuz nothing else matters
