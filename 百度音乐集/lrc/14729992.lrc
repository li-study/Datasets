[00:07.52]Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on
[00:16.54]When when men look outside, do they see houses
[00:20.54]Instead of the fields they grew from
[00:26.38]We are Constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
[00:35.21]Can you get up right now, endeavor to freefall (Off)
[00:44.53]You can fall if you want to, It's just a matter of how far
[02:42.77][00:49.71]You've treasured our home town
[02:45.29][00:51.86]But you've forgotten where you are
[02:47.34][00:54.33]And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found
[02:51.50][00:58.71]and it has been found wondering around
[02:56.31][02:09.78][01:03.52]With that skipping rope, the trampoline
[02:59.26][02:12.38][01:06.58]The crafty smoke that made us choke
[03:01.70][02:14.80][01:08.83]But we didn't give up hope
[03:05.52][02:19.10][01:12.51]It's just the simple ways, of getting paid
[03:08.60][02:21.72][01:15.76]The carelessnes of running away
[03:18.85][03:14.19][03:10.90][02:32.39][02:26.69][02:23.81][01:26.06][01:21.76][01:18.17]I wish I stayed
[01:32.05]Patterns all aranged in my background
[01:35.27]It's pillars and posts keeping this country on form
[01:40.89]Letters were all sent with no addresses
[01:44.40]So that people can't discover
[01:49.00]Always undercover
[01:51.52]Why do i always draw triangles
[01:54.53]Instead of words this paper so deserves
[02:00.17]You see
[02:01.19]I don't own my clothes but i own my mind
[02:04.85]And it's not what you've lost
[02:07.22]But it's what you find.
[02:37.70]cos you can fall if you want to
[02:40.19]It's just a matter of how far
[03:24.43]...
