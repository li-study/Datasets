[00:20.60]The sun is filling up the room
[00:23.74]And I can hear you dreaming
[00:27.08]Do you feel the way I do, right now?
[00:32.89]
[00:33.49]I wish we would just give up
[00:36.60]'Cause the best part is falling
[00:39.89]Call it anything but love
[00:43.40]
[00:44.08]And I will make sure to keep my distance
[00:52.05]Say I love you when you're not listening
[00:58.40]How long can we keep this up, up, up?
[01:11.52]
[01:18.32]Please don't stand so close to me
[01:21.28]I'm having trouble breathing
[01:24.73]I'm afraid of what you'll see, right now
[01:30.52]
[01:31.15]I'll give you everything I am
[01:34.18]All my broken heartbeats
[01:37.64]Until I know you'll understand
[01:41.07]
[01:41.67]And I will make sure to keep my distance
[01:49.73]Say I love you when you're not listening
[01:56.22]How long can we keep this up, up, up?
[02:11.21]
[02:12.03]And I keep waiting
[02:18.18]For you to take me
[02:24.76]And you keep waiting
[02:30.33]To save what we had
[02:33.26]
[02:33.87]So I'll make sure to keep my distance
[02:40.89]Say I love you when you're not listening
[02:47.37]How long can we keep this up, up, up?
[02:59.31]
[03:00.01]Make sure to keep my distance
[03:06.36]Say I love you when you're not listening
[03:13.31]How long 'til we call this love, love, love?
