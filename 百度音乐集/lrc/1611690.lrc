[00:03.72]Pussycat Dolls
[00:04.88]
[00:09.31]We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
[00:13.75]And right now radio's all that we can hear
[00:17.83]Now we ain't talk since we left, it's so over do
[00:22.12]It's cold outside but between us...
[00:25.83]
[00:26.16]The world slows down
[00:29.62]But my heart beats fast right now
[00:34.31]I know this is the part
[00:40.70]Where the end starts
[00:43.40]
[00:43.68]I can't take it any longer
[00:46.46]Thought that we were stronger
[00:48.61]All we do is linger
[00:50.73]Slipping through our fingers
[00:52.90]I don't wanna try now
[00:55.03]All that's left is good-bye
[00:57.18]To find a way that I can tell you
[01:01.39]I hate this part right here
[01:05.65]I hate this part right here
[01:09.98]I just can't take your tears
[01:14.20]I hate this part right here
[01:18.46]
[01:18.80]Everyday, 7 takes of the same old scene
[01:22.40]Seems we're bound by the loss of the civilty
[01:26.75]Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
[01:30.94]But will you sleep once I tell you...
[01:34.07]
[01:34.71]The world slows down
[01:38.43]But my heart beats fast right now
[01:43.14]I know this is the part
[01:49.52]Where the end starts
[01:52.28]
[01:52.60]I can't take it any longer
[01:55.25]Thought that we were stronger
[01:57.38]All we do is linger
[01:59.55]Slipping through our fingers
[02:01.71]I don't wanna try now
[02:03.81]All that's left is good-bye
[02:06.04]To find a way that I can tell you
[02:10.29]I hate this part right here
[02:14.57]I hate this part right here
[02:18.83]I just can't take your tears
[02:23.12]I hate this part right here
[02:26.49]
[02:26.90]I know you'll ask me to hold on
[02:30.67]And carry on like nothing's wrong
[02:34.98]But there is no more time for lies
[02:39.21]'Cause I see ??? in your eyes
[02:44.59]
[02:44.95]I can't take it any longer
[02:46.87]Thought that we were stronger
[02:49.07]All we do is linger
[02:51.25]Slipping through our fingers
[02:53.33]I don't wanna try now
[02:55.46]All that's left is good-bye
[02:57.65]To find a way that I can tell you
[03:01.56]
[03:01.92]That I gotta do it,
[03:03.97]I gotta do it,
[03:06.16]I gotta do it
[03:08.31]I hate this part
[03:10.47]I gotta do it,
[03:12.56]I gotta do it,
[03:14.77]I gotta do it
[03:17.16]
[03:18.95]I hate this part right here
[03:23.37]I hate this part right here
[03:27.63]And I just can't take these tears
[03:31.95]I hate this part right here
[03:35.78]
