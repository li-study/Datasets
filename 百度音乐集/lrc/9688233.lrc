[00:01.00]--Beautiful
[00:12.00]And time stands still beneath the air of waiting hours,
[00:22.00]To touch, just to feel a love that seems to overpower me.
[00:32.00]She's all I'll ever need,
[00:36.00]And you know her love just hypnotizes me,
[00:40.00]Til All I see is beautiful.
[00:52.00]
[00:57.00]At night I dream that you were sent to me from heaven,
[01:07.00]My Life, it seems so lonely here without your presence.
[01:15.00]You could change my everyday,
[01:21.00]And I could never think of love without your name.
[01:27.00]As you remain---
[01:29.00]Beautiful--- like the summer rain to wash away the winter stain.
[01:39.00]Beautiful--- like the morning sun inviting the dawn to break.
[01:49.00]Beautiful--- like the joy that comes when the love you've .longed for has just begun.
[01:59.00]Beautiful--- making everything brand new.
[02:09.00]Beautiful you.
[02:19.00]
[02:27.00]And all this time you're changing me to something better,
[02:37.00]A love so high that everyday that we're together.
[02:45.00]I will leave the world below,
[02:51.00]Until your heart becomes the only thing I know.
[02:57.00]All I know is---
[02:59.00]Beautiful--- like the summer rain to wash away the winter stain.
[03:09.00]Beautiful--- like the morning sun inviting the dawn to break.
[03:19.00]Beautiful--- like the joy that comes when the love you've longed for has just begun.
[03:29.00]Beautiful--- making everything brand new.
[03:39.00]Beautiful you.
