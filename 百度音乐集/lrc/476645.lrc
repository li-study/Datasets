[00:-04.00]Keaton Simons - Joseph
[00:-01.00]

[00:00.59]Joseph was a child of light
[00:03.94]He never disappeared
[00:08.75]Standing up on dim lit stages
[00:12.55]Shielded by his tears
[00:15.72]
[00:16.80]Though he was not a lonesome one
[00:20.88]His loneliest surprise
[00:25.17]Was trapped in unseen reservoirs
[00:29.14]Whose borders were his eyes
[00:32.48]
[00:33.66]Lylah never quite broke in
[00:37.59]Never got too used to life
[00:42.09]Standing up on podiums
[00:46.01]Her words cut like a knife
[00:49.24]
[00:50.28]But when confronted with her skin
[00:54.51]Irrelevant, she'd say
[00:58.75]If only I'd been born a bird
[01:02.77]I'd fly them all away
[01:06.09]
[01:07.01]I got a problem with right or wrong
[01:11.72]‘Cause it changes all the time
[01:15.33]The weakest ones are acting strong
[01:20.01]So people gotta die
[01:22.85]
[01:23.98]Lula Belle was walkin' home
[01:28.21]Beneath the crimson sky
[01:32.60]A cool dry wind began to blow
[01:36.66]She could feel it in her eyes
[01:39.65]
[01:40.70]She came to get some fresh supplies
[01:44.99]From an undercover cop
[01:49.17]A box with biohazard signs
[01:53.32]Is where she makes the drop
[01:56.35]
[01:57.35]I got a problem with right or wrong
[02:01.74]‘Cause it changes all the time
[02:05.86]The weakest ones are acting strong
[02:10.09]So people gotta die
[02:13.64]
[02:14.54]Franklin was a camera man
[02:18.58]A teleprompter scribe
[02:23.06]Every night he tamed his hand
[02:26.83]Just to give it one more try
[02:30.23]
[02:31.25]He never had to write the lies
[02:35.31]He just had to spell them right
[02:39.80]Said if people knew what I do
[02:44.00]They'd be in the streets tonight
[02:46.97]
[02:47.93]I got a problem with right or wrong
[02:52.23]‘Cause it changes all the time
[02:56.17]The weakest ones are acting strong
[03:00.72]So people gotta die
[03:04.37]
[03:05.24]I got a problem with right or wrong
[03:09.02]‘Cause it changes all the time
[03:13.07]The weakest ones are acting strong
[03:17.76]So people gotta die
[03:22.19]People gotta die
[03:25.76]
