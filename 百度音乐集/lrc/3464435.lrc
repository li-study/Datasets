[00:05.66]Summer Rain - Belinda Carlisle
[00:07.73]
[00:10.94]Whispering our goodbyes
[00:12.66]Waiting for a train
[00:14.37]I was dancing with my baby
[00:16.17]In the summer rain
[00:17.78]
[00:18.39]I can hear him saying
[00:19.84]Nothing will change
[00:21.48]Come dancing with me baby
[00:23.47]In the summer rain
[00:24.84]
[00:26.51]I remember the rain on our skin
[00:29.01]And his kisses hotter than the
[00:31.40]Santa Ana winds
[00:32.74]
[00:33.20]Whispering our goodbyes
[00:34.43]Waiting for a train
[00:36.43]I was dancing with my baby
[00:38.67]In the summer rain
[00:39.82]
[00:41.17]I remember laughing till we almost cried
[00:45.61](There at station that night)
[00:48.25]I remember looking in his eyes
[00:53.45]
[00:55.47]Oh my love, it's you that I dream of
[01:00.25]Oh my love, since that day
[01:03.66]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[01:07.61]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[01:09.35]
[01:11.33]Doesn't matter what I do now
[01:14.14]Doesn't matter what I say
[01:18.47]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[01:22.46]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[01:25.46]
[01:37.60]I can hear the whistle
[01:39.38]Military train
[01:41.09]I was dancing with my baby
[01:43.19]In the summer rain
[01:44.29]
[01:45.10]I can here him singing
[01:46.66]Ooh"Love Is Strange?"
[01:48.47]Come dance with me baby
[01:50.18]In the summer rain
[01:52.20]
[01:53.26]I remember the rain pouring down
[01:55.75]And we poured our hearts out
[01:57.96]As the train pulled out
[01:59.75]I can see my baby
[02:01.21]Waving from the train
[02:03.18]It was last time that I saw him
[02:05.18]In the summer rain
[02:09.94]Oh my love, it's you that I dream of
[02:13.62]Oh my love, since that day
[02:18.31]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[02:22.02]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[02:24.91]
[02:25.92]Doesn't matter what I do now
[02:28.29]Doesn't matter what I say
[02:32.92]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[02:35.90]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[02:38.96]
[02:54.40]Every time I see the lightening
[02:57.93]Every time I hear the thunder
[03:01.91]Every time I close the window
[03:05.44]When this happens in the summer
[03:09.10]Oh the night is so inviting
[03:12.82]I can feel that you are so close
[03:16.66]I can feel you when the wind blows
[03:19.59]Blows right through my heart
[03:21.64]
[03:31.91]Oh my love, it's you that I dream of
[03:36.50]Oh my love, since that day
[03:40.34]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[03:42.99]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[03:45.94]Every night and every day now
[03:46.07]
[03:50.43]Though I know you've gone away
[03:54.34]Somewhere in my heart I'm always
[03:58.48]Dancing with you in the summer rain
[04:01.56]
