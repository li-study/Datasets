[00:00.00]This Is The Life
[00:01.64]Amy MacDonald
[00:12.53]
[00:12.70]Oh the wind whistles down
[00:15.47]The cold dark street tonight
[00:17.58]And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
[00:22.71]And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
[00:25.21]While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
[00:27.54]And the songs they get louder
[00:29.07]Each one better than before
[00:31.09]
[00:32.22]And you're singing the songs
[00:33.21]Thinking this is the life
[00:34.59]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[00:37.35]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[00:39.07]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[00:41.03]
[00:42.31]And you're singing the songs
[00:43.45]Thinking this is the life
[00:44.73]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[00:47.36]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[00:49.53]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[00:52.18]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[00:54.05]
[01:03.17]So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
[01:05.64]And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
[01:08.25]But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
[01:13.27]So you're sitting there with nothing to do
[01:15.71]Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
[01:18.32]And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
[01:21.71]
[01:22.84]And you're singing the songs
[01:23.77]Thinking this is the life
[01:25.11]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[01:27.85]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[01:29.82]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[01:31.97]
[01:32.89]And you're singing the songs
[01:34.08]Thinking this is the life
[01:35.35]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[01:38.30]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[01:39.89]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[01:42.71]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[01:45.13]
[02:03.27]And you're singing the songs
[02:04.29]Thinking this is the life
[02:05.63]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[02:08.36]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[02:10.44]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[02:12.06]
[02:13.23]And you're singing the songs
[02:14.53]Thinking this is the life
[02:15.88]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[02:18.27]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[02:20.62]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[02:22.11]
[02:23.44]And you're singing the songs
[02:24.73]Thinking this is the life
[02:25.91]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[02:28.55]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[02:30.41]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[02:32.61]
[02:33.63]And you're singing the songs
[02:34.70]Thinking this is the life
[02:35.91]And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
[02:38.58]Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
[02:40.54]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[02:42.94]
[02:44.03]Where you gonna sleep tonight?
