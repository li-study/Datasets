[00:00]EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD
[00:04]Air Supply
[00:08](Dominic Buggatti/Frank Musker)
[00:12]Every night seems dinner and wine
[00:15]Saturday days
[00:18]I was never in love, never had the time
[00:21]In my hustle and hurried world
[00:24]Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely
[00:30]I needed someone to hold me, oh
[00:36]It's such a crazy home town
[00:38]It can drag you down
[00:39]Till you run out of dreams
[00:42]So you party all night to the music and lights
[00:45]But you don't know what happiness means
[00:48]I was dancing in the dark with strangers
[00:52]No love around me
[00:55]When suddenly you found me, oh
[01:00]Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
[01:07]You're my fantasy, you're my reality
[01:13]Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
[01:20]You're everything I need, you're everything to me
[01:25]Oh girl
[01:38]Everything good, everything fine
[01:41]That's what you are
[01:44]So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb
[01:48]As high as the highest star
[01:50]I'm living the life time in every minute
[01:54]That we're together
[01:57]And I'm staying right here forever, oh
[02:59][02:35][02:01]Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
[03:06][02:42][02:09]You're my fantasy, you're my reality
[03:11][02:47][02:14]Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
[03:18][02:54][02:21]You're everything I need, you're everything to me
[02:27]Oh girl
