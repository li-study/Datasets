
[00:22.00]In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey,
[00:25.00]butane in my veins so I'm out to get the junkie
[00:27.00]with the plastic eyeballs, spraypaint the vegetables,
[00:30.00]dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose,
[00:33.00]kill the headlights and put it in neutral,
[00:36.00]stockcar flaming with a loser in the cruise control,
[00:39.00]baby's in Reno with the vitamin D,
[00:41.00]got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat,
[00:45.00]someone came sayin' I'm a saint (I'm insane)
[00:47.00]to complain about
[00:48.00]a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt,
[00:50.00]don't believe everything that you breathe,
[00:53.00]you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve,
[00:56.00]so shave your face with some mace in the dark,
[00:59.00]saving all your food stamps for burning down the trailer park,
[01:02.00]yo, cut it
[01:07.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me,
[01:17.00]double barrel buckshot,
[01:18.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me,
[01:30.00]forces of evil on a bozo nightmare,
[01:32.00]ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
[01:35.00]cause one's got a weasel and others got a flag,
[01:38.00]one's on the pole, shove the other in the bag,
[01:41.00]with the rerun shows and cocaine nose job,
[01:44.00]the daytime crap of the folk singers slop,
[01:46.00]he hung himself with a guitar string,
[01:49.00]a slab of turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing,
[01:52.00]I can't write if ya' can't relate,
[01:55.00]trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate,
[01:57.00]and my time is a piece of wax, fallen on a termite,
[02:02.00]who's chokin' on the splinters
[02:03.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[02:13.00]get crazy with the cheez-wiz,
[02:15.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[02:24.00]drive, by, body pierce
[02:26.00]yo bring it on down
[02:32.00]Soy
[02:57.00]I'm a driver, I'm a winner
[02:58.00]things are gonna' change I can feel it
[02:59.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[03:10.00]I can't believe it
[03:11.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[03:22.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[03:32.00]Sprechen sie deutsch, baby
[03:34.00]Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
[03:43.00]You know what I'm sayin'
