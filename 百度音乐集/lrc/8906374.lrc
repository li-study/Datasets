[00:00.79]11. Inside
[00:01.13]
[00:01.93]We're the little creatures
[00:03.47]deep inside your mind.
[00:05.53]
[00:06.59]Some call us their fantasy
[00:09.75]but some to never find.
[00:12.18]
[00:13.08]We can teach philosophy
[00:16.27]but still we must commend...
[00:18.88]
[00:19.55]The state of our existence
[00:22.64]right into your hand
[00:25.84]Welcome to this place in here come overstep all your fears...
[00:28.15]
[00:33.09]Where have you all been once
[00:36.32]when I was alone?
[00:39.66]When I was a hero in their crazy wicked show
[00:46.14]you've sent no little spark
[00:48.74]into my darkened view of life.
[00:52.72]Did not make me ask for what is wrong
[00:56.70]and what is right.
[00:58.21]
[00:58.94]And still I regret to be here.
[01:05.35]I'm dreaming of Anna in tears.
[01:13.37]
[01:15.31]Inside - so deep inside
[01:21.17]you will die if I don't dream anymore?
[01:27.96]Inside - so deep inside
[01:34.13]you will die if I don't dream anymore?
[01:40.99]Inside - so deep inside
[01:47.02]you will die if I don't dream anymore?
[01:53.79]Inside - so deep inside
[02:00.18]you will die if I don't dream anymore?
