[00:00.95]It wasn\'t supposed to be like this
[00:03.71]Another dose of unhappiness
[00:06.67]I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
[00:13.10]So I got drunk
[00:15.32]Had sex with all your friends
[00:18.26]You told me that I should never call your house again
[00:24.21]
[00:24.53]Emily, you saved the day
[00:35.02]Emily, when you threw me away
[00:46.30]
[00:47.15]She was always such a pretty girl
[00:48.96]Nobody like her in the world
[00:50.37]A little piece of heavenly
[00:51.84]That no one else could stand
[00:53.41]I see you in my dreams at night
[00:54.83]I see you when I close my eyes
[00:56.24]I just can\'t seem to shake you, Emily
[01:01.56]
[01:02.81]You got your money and I got cast
[01:05.79]Outside thrown out on my ass
[01:09.09]In the city with no one else, no where else to go
[01:14.88]So I hooked up with this model from Singapore
[01:20.61]Emily, I sure am glad you didn\'t want me anymore
[01:26.23]
[01:26.67]Emily, you saved the day
[01:37.21]Emily, when you threw me away
[01:48.66]
[01:49.37]She was always such a pretty girl
[01:51.09]Nobody like her in the world
[01:52.56]A little piece of heavenly
[01:54.05]That no one else could stand
[01:55.56]I see you in my dreams at night
[01:57.00]I see you when I close my eyes
[01:58.58]I just can\'t seem to shake you, Emily
[02:04.45]
[02:25.24]She was always such a pretty girl
[02:27.05]Nobody like her in the world
[02:28.25]A little piece of heavenly
[02:29.69]That no one else could stand
[02:31.23]I see you in my dreams at night
[02:32.65]I see you when I close my eyes
[02:34.08]I just can\'t seem to shake you, Emily
[02:39.50]
[02:39.69]Emily, you saved the day
[02:51.33]Emily, you saved the day
[03:03.20]Emily, you saved my ass
