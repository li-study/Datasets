[00:-3.00]Ronan Keating - Vincent
[00:-2.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:01.12]Starry, starry night
[00:05.25]Paint your palette blue and gray
[00:10.60]Look out on a summer's day
[00:14.08]With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
[00:18.01]Shadows on the hills
[00:22.88]Sketch the trees and the daffodils
[00:27.97]Catch the breeze and the winter chills
[00:31.54]In colors on the snowy linen land
[00:35.60]
[00:38.41]Now I understand
[00:43.31]What you tried to say to me
[00:47.58]How you suffered for your sanity
[00:52.52]How you tried to set them free
[00:56.35]They would not listen they did not know how
[01:01.81]Perhaps they'll listen now
[01:04.28]
[01:07.33]Starry, starry night
[01:12.27]Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
[01:17.29]Swirling clouds in violet haze
[01:20.95]Reflecting Vincent's eyes of China blue
[01:25.01]Colors changing hue
[01:30.05]Morning fields of amber grain
[01:35.17]Weathered faces lined in pain
[01:38.78]Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hands
[01:42.29]
[01:42.53]Now I understand
[01:47.67]What you tried to say to me
[01:52.23]How you suffered for your sanity
[01:57.08]How you tried to set them free
[02:00.09]They would not listen they did not know how
[02:06.16]Perhaps they'll listen now
[02:08.20]
[02:08.39]For they could not love you
[02:13.20]But still your love was true
[02:18.40]And when no hope was left in sight
[02:21.32]On that starry, starry night
[02:25.15]You took your life as lovers often do
[02:30.66]But I could have told you Vincent
[02:33.16]This world was never meant for one as
[02:36.27]beautiful as you
[02:39.68]
[02:42.40]Starry, starry night
[02:47.33]Portraits hung in empty halls
[02:52.43]Frameless heads on nameless walls
[02:55.77]With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
[03:00.43]Like the strangers that you've met
[03:04.41]The ragged men in ragged clothes
[03:09.40]The silver thorn on a bloody rose
[03:12.89]Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
[03:16.86]
[03:17.07]Now I think I know
[03:22.02]What you tried to say to me
[03:26.68]How you suffered for your sanity
[03:31.59]How you tried to set them free
[03:35.18]They would not listen they're not listening still
[03:40.75]Perhaps they never will
[03:45.99]
