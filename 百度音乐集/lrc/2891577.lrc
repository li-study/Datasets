[00:02.50]Write down,to remind yourself on how it can be, how it can be
[00:12.98]Heartstrings, you're tugging at my heartstrings, heartstrings
[00:23.01]Helpless, I have become so helpless to your touch, so
[00:29.30]touch me somehow
[00:33.19]Restless, you leave me restless
[00:37.09]breathless wait for me
[00:42.50]The closer I come to you
[00:44.92]the closer I am to finding God
[00:49.80]You're a miracle to me
[00:52.47]The closer I come to you
[00:54.94]the closer I am to finding God
[00:59.88]You're a miracle to me
[01:03.82]Burning, like Joan of Arc to see you, just to feel you
[01:13.65]Cadence, I would dance with the dead cause I believe
[01:18.32]yes I believe, yes I believe
[01:23.80]Stifle, Paul said that you stifle him
[01:29.21]again and again and again
[01:33.15]The closer I come to you

[01:39.99]You're a miracle to me
[01:43.25]The closer I come to you
[01:45.61]the closer I am to finding God
[01:50.48]You're a miracle to me
[01:54.16]And if these are my parting words
[01:59.26]Then this is  my last request
[02:04.17]Hold me here, until I sleep
[02:08.95]If I burn, then I burn for you
[02:34.01]The closer I come to you
[02:36.34]The close I am to finding God
