[00:01.99]
[00:33.88]Oh, you're such a pretty thing
[00:35.31]I'll take you and I'll make you all mine.
[00:39.31]
[00:42.01]I will steal you from this patient world
[00:44.06]Let it chase us, it could never take you back.
[00:47.83]
[00:50.14]We could watch it from the clouds,
[00:52.16]We can't stop it anyhow,
[00:54.08]It's not ours.
[00:58.21]We could watch it from the clouds,
[01:00.30]We can't stop it anyhow,
[01:02.17]It's not ours.
[01:10.03]
[01:23.90]I know you know me well enough to know I'm lucky to have you.
[01:31.66]But oh, it's just the little things,
[01:33.72]The words that I should tell you all the time.
[01:37.10]
[01:40.14]Like, You're so sweet to me,
[01:42.14]When you beat me in double solitaire.
[01:48.29]You're so sweet to me,
[01:50.92]In a world that's not always fair.
[01:53.26]
[01:56.32]We could watch it from the clouds,
[01:58.22]We can't stop it anyhow,
[02:00.09]It's not ours.
[02:04.42]We could watch it from the clouds,
[02:06.52]We can't stop it anyhow,
[02:08.37]It's not ours.
[02:10.34]
[02:13.50]The more love that you feel,
[02:16.97]The more your little heart will ache.
[02:21.18]Love's the only thing that carries on,
[02:25.02]It's the only thing this world can take.
[02:28.47]This love is ours.
[02:33.47]This love is ours.
[02:37.59]This love is oooooooo..
[02:53.68]
[02:55.18]Oh, you're such a pretty thing,
[02:56.88]I'll take you and I'll make you all mine.
