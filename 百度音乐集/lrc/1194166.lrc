[00:45.57]O green world
[01:04.90]Don′t desert me now
[01:08.76]Bring me back to fallen town
[01:12.40]Where someone is still alive
[01:16.06]
[01:16.59]Fighting for something new in this
[01:19.36]When no one needs the heart of me and I′ll
[01:27.41]Get out somewhere other than me before...
[01:35.75]
[02:43.84]O green world
[02:46.49]Don′t deserve me now
[02:50.37]I′m made of you and you of me
[02:54.14]But where are we? Oh no
[02:58.31]Sells to lie
[03:02.01]Phone with talk, you stars
[03:05.53]Suppose you
[03:06.13]Down when you′re in fast
[03:09.40]Cause it seems so little to you
[03:14.19]But now you′re in love, you know
[03:17.95]You know, me too
[03:21.31]You know, me too
[03:24.69]I hope sex and drugs rust into my self, holy
[03:29.46]It feels holy
[03:33.37]It feels like you′re with your
[03:39.39]father in the place you love
