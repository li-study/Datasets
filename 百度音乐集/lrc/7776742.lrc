[00:00.00]The Silent Man
[00:01.04]By SayNo
[00:01.65
[00:01.88]A question well served,
[00:05.17]'Is silence like a fever?'
[00:10.47]'A voice never heard?'
[00:14.62]'Or a message with no receiver?'
[00:20.63]Pray they won't ask
[00:24.78]Behind the stained glass
[00:30.55]There's always one more mask
[00:36.22]Has man been a victim
[00:40.56]of his woman, of his father?
[00:46.31]if he elects not to bother,
[00:50.41]will he suffocate their faith?
[00:56.53]Desperate to fall
[01:01.14]Behind the Great Wall
[01:06.29]That separates us all
[01:11.65]When there is reason
[01:16.81]Tonight I'm Awake
[01:21.96]when there's no answer
[01:26.56]Arrive the Silent Man
[01:31.94]If there is balance
[01:37.62]tonight He's Awake
[01:41.84]If they have to suffer
[01:47.09]There lies the Silent Man
[02:26.13]Sin without deceivers
[02:31.12]A God with no believers
[02:35.74]I could sail by
[02:38.79]on the Winds of Silence
[02:41.23]And maybe they won't notice
[02:45.71]But this time I think
[02:48.91]It'd be better if I swim
[02:54.21]When there is reason
[02:58.77]Tonight I'm Awake
[03:04.13]When there's no answer
[03:09.04]Arrive the Silent Man
[03:14.19]If there is balance
[03:19.33]Tonight he's Awake
[03:24.14]But if they have to suffer
[03:29.39]There lies the Silent Man
