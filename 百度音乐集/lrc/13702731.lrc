[00:00.57]
[00:00.77]Sometimes is never quite enough
[00:11.98]If you're flawless, then you'll win my love
[00:25.37]Don't forget to win first place
[00:31.62]Don't forget to keep that smile on your face
[00:38.08]
[00:40.19]Be a good boy
[00:45.48]Try a little harder
[00:52.16]You've got to measure up
[00:58.39]And make me prouder
[01:05.23]
[01:05.66]How long before you screw it up
[01:17.99]How many times do I have to tell you to hurry up
[01:30.48]With everything I do for you
[01:36.54]The least you can do is keep quiet
[01:43.05]
[01:45.23]Be a good girl
[01:50.07]You've gotta try a little harder
[01:57.14]That simply wasn't good enough
[02:03.35]To make us proud
[02:07.63]
[02:11.27]I'll live through you
[02:12.81]I'll make you what I never was
[02:16.15]If you're the best, then maybe so am I
[02:18.98]Compared to him compared to her
[02:22.08]I'm doing this for your own damn good
[02:26.16]You'll make up for what I blew
[02:28.71]What's the problem...why are you crying
[02:37.56]
[02:38.20]Be a good boy
[02:43.43]Push a little farther now
[02:49.93]That wasn't fast enough
[02:56.83]To make us happy
[03:03.10]We'll love you just the way you are
[03:15.15]If you're perfect
[03:18.27]
