[00:40.63]Hey I was just a skinny lad
[00:45.75]Never knew no good from bad
[00:48.41]But I knew love before I left my nursery
[00:53.87]Left alone with big fat Fanny
[00:56.58]She was such a naughty nanny
[00:59.22]Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me

[01:34.19]Across the wire across the land
[01:36.73]I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
[01:42.09]But their beauty and their style
[01:44.65]Went kind of smooth after a while
[01:47.67]Take me to them lovely ladies every time

[02:32.38]Now your mortgages and homes
[02:35.26]And the stiffness in your bones
[02:38.03]Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
[02:43.61]Oh but I still get my pleasure
[02:46.36]Still get my greatest treasure
