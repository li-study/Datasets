[00:13.82]Taking Back Sunday -
[00:15.54]Divine Intervention Lyrics
[00:17.78]by kakafifi
[00:23.62]Despondent, distracted,
[00:27.38]You're vicious and romantic;
[00:31.73]These are a few of my favorite things.
[00:39.59]All of those flavors and
[00:43.57]This is what you choose:
[00:46.52]Past the blues, past the blues,
[00:50.83]And on to something new,
[00:54.06]Something real, make it timeless,
[01:01.86]An act of God and nothing else will be accepted.
[01:09.18]So if you're calling me out,
[01:13.13]Then count me out.
[01:16.12]
[01:29.50]Yeah, we're stubborn and melodramatic,
[01:33.08]A real class act.
[01:37.28]You see, I know a few of your favorite things.
[01:45.78]Five in the morning and all comes out pouring,Love
[01:53.60]out the same way in.
[02:00.67]Something real, make it timeless,
[02:08.07]An act of God and nothing else will be accepted.
[02:15.32]Now if you're calling me out,
[02:19.44]Then count me out.
[02:21.95]
[02:50.85]Something real, make it timeless,
[02:58.74]An act of God and nothing else will be accepted.
[03:06.45]I said real, make it timeless,
[03:14.19]An act of God and nothing else will be accepted.
[03:21.51]Now if you're calling me out,
[03:27.13]Then count me out.
