[00:25.06]
[00:27.06]There's a saying old says that love is blind
[00:32.89]Still we're often told　“seek and ye shall find”
[00:39.01]So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
[00:50.34]Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
[00:56.09]He's the big affair I cannot forget
[01:01.83]Only man I ever think of with regret
[01:09.57]
[03:35.94][01:14.90]I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
[03:41.90][01:22.44]Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?
[01:39.00]There's a somebody I'm longing to see
[01:46.81]I hope that he turns out to be
[01:54.80]Someone who'll watch over me
[02:06.07]
[02:11.14]I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
[02:19.41]I know I could always be good
[02:27.18]To one who'll watch over me
[02:37.95]
[02:42.16]Although he may not be the man some
[02:46.73]Girls think of as handsome
[02:50.38]To my heart he carries the key
[02:57.10]
[03:02.62]Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
[03:10.23]Follow my lead, oh, how I need
[03:18.20]Someone to watch over me
[03:58.31][03:28.58]
[04:04.31]【 おわり 】
