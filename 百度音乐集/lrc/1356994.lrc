[00:03.47]
[00:06.16]Boy, these are crazy kinds
[00:09.11]It nearly blows my mind living
[00:12.67]In this messed up world
[00:17.04]You're not the one to blame
[00:19.99]But if it's all the same to you
[00:23.54]We gotta get alone
[00:28.13]New possibilities
[00:29.69]Living in this earless dream for show
[00:34.62]We're gonna get them someday
[00:37.87]
[00:39.21]From no hands up in the air
[00:41.90]Living life without a care
[00:44.63]So much for a soul to share
[00:47.33]Underneath the sun
[00:50.22]Dancing moving zaga zag
[00:52.96]Come on, you'll all enjoy the ride
[00:55.79]It won't be long
[00:57.75]Cos we're all will singing the same song

[01:12.43]Of the things we never did I know
[01:16.17]All we wanna say

[01:23.44]That makes his beautiful for show
[01:26.83]There's gotta be a better way

[01:48.11]It won't be long
[01:50.22]Cos we're all will singing the same song
[01:54.56]Search tip we knew we'll find
[01:57.19]Don't let it blow your mind
[01:59.97]It's better everytime
[02:02.77]Ohhhooo
