[00:34.43]Creepin’ up on you is the wrong thing to do
[00:38.86]I found your address and got your phone number too
[00:43.26]Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
[00:47.74]Been to secret places you think nobody knows
[00:52.53]If I had to live without you
[00:55.47]Nobody could
[00:57.00]I need to be around you
[00:59.85]Watching you
[01:01.10]No one else can love you like I do
[01:05.52]Feel it when I’m creepin’ up on you
[01:09.97]I know that it wouldn’t be right
[01:13.15]If I stayed all night
[01:15.09]Just to peep in on you
[01:17.79]Creepin’ up on you
[01:21.56]
[01:24.04]Creepin’ up on you
[01:25.82]
[01:27.82]I’ve been hanging ’round all the places you haunt
[01:32.16]Spying on your friends to find out what you want
[01:36.66]Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
[01:41.12]Follow you around driving home in your car
[01:45.88]Do I have to breathe without you?
[01:48.58]’Cause nobody could
[01:50.39]I need to be around you
[01:53.20]Watching you
[01:54.44]No one else can love you like I do
[01:58.84]Feel it when I’m creepin’ up on you
[02:03.28]I know that it wouldn’t be right
[02:06.38]If I stayed all night
[02:08.42]Just to peep in on you
[02:11.13]Creepin’ up on you
[02:14.79]
[02:17.30]Creepin’ up on you
[02:19.64]
[02:21.71]I know this must be wrong
[02:24.00]It can’t go on
[02:25.62]This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
[02:28.96]And **** me a mockery
[02:31.20]This must be wrong
[02:32.83]It can’t go on
[02:34.35]So won’t somebody free me from this misery?
[02:37.78]Bring my baby closer to me
[02:42.35]
[02:56.67]’Cause no one else can love you like I do
[03:00.94]You feel it when I’m creepin’ up on you
[03:05.62]I know that it wouldn’t be right
[03:08.64]If I stayed all night
[03:10.71]Just to peep in on you
[03:13.29]Creepin’
[03:14.59]No one else can love you like I do
[03:18.40]I know you feel it when I’m creepin up on you
[03:23.39]I know that it wouldn’t be right
[03:26.20]If I stayed all night
[03:28.49]Just to peep in on you
[03:31.17]Creepin’ up on you
[03:35.27]
[03:41.20]’Cause no one else can love you, no no
[03:45.93]Like I do
[03:49.37]I know you feel me peeping in on you
[03:54.50]Watching everything you do
[03:58.71]’Cause no one else can love you, no
[04:03.62]Like I do
[04:07.85]No one else should love you, no
[04:12.67]Like I do
[04:16.70]Baby creepin’ up on you
[04:21.17]Watching everything you do
[04:24.43]Yeah ’cause no one else can love you
[04:28.76]No no one else should touch you
[04:33.35]No one else can love you
[04:37.11]Touch you
[04:38.80]Love you
[04:40.49]Be with you
[04:42.14]No
[04:43.02]
