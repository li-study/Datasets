[00:00.25]
[00:00.96]Were you born in 74? (Oh no)
[00:04.71]Are you the kind of guy that I should ignore?
[00:08.75]Will you give me all the things I need?
[00:12.52]You probably never wear your heart on your sleeve
[00:16.60]You intrigue me like no one before
[00:20.49]It may be wrong to get to know you more
[00:23.64]But I\'m not sure
[00:27.54]I\'m so unsure
[00:30.85]
[00:31.25]\'Cause I see danger, danger, danger in your eyes
[00:40.00]\'Cause danger, danger, danger, you disguise
[00:47.97]So baby lift your head up to the light
[00:55.89]There\'s danger in those eyes
[01:04.25]There\'s danger in your eyes
[01:11.13]
[01:12.99]You belong to my darker side
[01:16.96]You\'re a guy who sets a girl on fire
[01:20.98]I can see myself falling in line
[01:24.94]Like the hundred girls you had over time
[01:28.10]And I want more
[01:31.83]I am so sure
[01:36.58]That I want more
[01:40.66]I am so sure
[01:43.42]\'Cause I see danger, danger, danger in your eyes
[01:52.32]\'Cause danger, danger, danger, you disguise
[02:00.30]So baby lift your head up to the light
[02:08.13]There\'s danger in those eyes
[02:16.27]
[02:17.51]I\'m smarter than this
[02:19.57]And know better than this
[02:21.41]\'Cause there\'s something really missin\' in your kiss
[02:25.56]I\'m smarter than this
[02:27.33]And know better than this
[02:29.39]But there\'s something that you got that is tough to resist
[02:35.70]It\'s tough to resist
[02:40.34]\'Cause I see danger, danger, danger in your eyes
[02:47.77]\'Cause danger, danger, danger, you disguise
[02:55.75]So baby lift your head up to the light
[03:03.81]There\'s danger in those eyes
[03:12.34]There\'s danger in your eyes
[03:20.77]There\'s danger in your eyes
[03:22.81]Dangereous
[03:23.38]You\'re dangerous
[03:24.23]You\'re dangerous
[03:25.82]
[03:26.29]End
