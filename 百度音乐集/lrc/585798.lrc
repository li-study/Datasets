[00:00.56]Home
[00:02.78]
[00:04.97]Sheryl Crow
[00:07.62]
[00:11.48]I woke up this morning
[00:12.91]
[00:14.41]Now I understand
[00:17.30]What it means to give your life
[00:20.24]To just one man
[00:23.12]Afraid of feeling nothing
[00:25.81]No bees or butterflies
[00:29.13]My head is full of voices
[00:31.63]And my house is full of lies
[00:34.61]This is home, home
[00:45.09]And this is home, home
[00:56.54]This is home
[01:00.31]
[01:09.24]I found your standing there
[01:12.13]When I was seventeen
[01:14.97]Now I'm thirty-two
[01:17.06]And I can't remember what I'd seen in you
[01:21.38]I made a promise
[01:24.12]Said it everyday
[01:26.23]Now I'm reading romance novels
[01:29.27]And I'm dreaming of yesterday
[01:31.81]This is home, home
[01:42.86]And this is home, home
[01:54.98]This is home
[02:04.99]
[02:08.12]I'd like to see the Riviera
[02:14.17]And slowdance underneath the stars
[02:19.92]I'd like to watch the sun come up
[02:26.56]In a stranger's arms
[02:29.89]This is home, home
[02:50.79]
[02:52.54]And this is home, home
[03:16.95]I'm going crazy
[03:19.38]A little at  everyday
[03:22.14]And everything I want to
[03:24.75]Is now driving your away
[03:28.23]I woke this morning
[03:30.95]To the sound of breaking hearts
[03:34.01]Mine is full of questions
[03:37.05]And it's tearing yours apart...tearing yours apart
[03:43.66]And it's tearing yours apart
[03:55.49]And it's tearing us apart
[04:04.93]
