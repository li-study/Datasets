[00:03]Cold as the northern winds
[00:11]in December mornings,
[00:22]Cold is the cry that rings
[00:32]from this far distant shore.
[00:42]Winter has come too late,
[00:51]too close beside me.
[01:00]How can I chase away
[01:08]all these fears deep inside?
[03:07][02:29]I'll wait the signs to come.
[03:15][01:26]I'll find a way.
[03:20][01:31]I will wait the time to come.
[03:29][01:40]I'll find a way home.
[01:49]My light shall be the moon,
[01:58]and my path - the ocean.
[02:07]My guide the morning star,
[02:16]as I sail home to you.
[03:35]Who then can warm my soul?
[03:43]Who can quell my passion?
[03:52]Out of these dreams - a boat
[04:01]I will sail home to you.
