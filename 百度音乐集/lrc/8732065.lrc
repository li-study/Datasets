[00:00.00]
[00:01.06]I can still remember the time you were there
[00:05.00]When I needed to hold you, feel you
[00:12.85]Everytime I ask you to find a new way
[00:17.53]You lie a new way
[00:20.27]Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[00:24.66]
[00:31.55]You said you'd change
[00:33.74]But I'm afraid
[00:36.36]It's something I won't live to see
[00:40.30]It's seems so strange
[00:42.71]That sometimes fate
[00:44.94]Can appear to be so real
[00:47.70]And yet turn out to be a fantasy
[00:49.96]
[00:50.23]Same old line, one more time
[00:52.69]Say you're gonna be, there for me
[00:54.71]Say you'll change, change your ways
[00:57.02]Never gonna keep your promises
[00:59.26]Same old game (You know it doesn't turn me on)
[01:01.54]Brand new day (You're singing that same old song)
[01:03.67]No more lies (If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
[01:08.28]
[01:08.67]Another night, another day
[01:11.94]What can I say
[01:14.14]You're still the same old brand new you
[01:17.61]You break your promises in two
[01:20.81]What can I do
[01:23.03]When you're the same old brand new you
[01:26.24]
[01:26.61]You'll change, you'll never change
[01:28.31]You're never never gonna keep your promises
[01:30.75]You'll change, you'll never change
[01:32.85]You're never never gonna keep your promises
[01:34.24]
[01:34.34]Because of you, I guess we're through
[01:39.30]Is this the way it has to be
[01:43.23]I've been a fool (I've been a fool)
[01:45.67]A fool for you (A fool for you)
[01:48.25]But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me
[01:52.84]
[01:53.07]Same old line, one more time
[01:55.19]Say you're gonna be, there for me
[01:57.39]Say you'll change, change your ways
[01:59.65]Never gonna keep your promises
[02:01.88]Same old game (You know it doesn't turn me on)
[02:04.38]Brand new day (You're singing that same old song)
[02:06.46]No more lies (If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
[02:11.04]
[02:11.28]Another night, another day
[02:14.71]What can I say

[02:29.12]
[02:29.14]I can still remember the time you were there
[02:32.06]When I needed to hold you, feel you
