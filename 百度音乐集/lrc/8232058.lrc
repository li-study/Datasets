[00:13.90]rushing and racing and running in circles
[00:17.49]moving so fast I'm forgetting my purpose
[00:20.53]blur of the traffic is sending me spinning
[00:23.39]getting nowhere
[00:25.68]
[00:26.23]my head and my heart are colliding chaotic
[00:29.24]pace of the world I just wish I could stop it
[00:32.19]Try to appear like I've got it together
[00:35.07]I'm falling apart
[00:37.42]
[00:37.79]save me
[00:41.47]somebody take my hand and lead me
[00:46.80]slow me down
[00:50.16]don't let love pass me by

[00:58.32]
[00:58.69]slow me down
[01:01.89]don't let me live a lie
[01:04.08]before my life flies by
[01:07.85]I need you to slow me down
[01:11.60]
[01:15.96]sometimes I fear that I might disappear
[01:18.45]in the blur of fast forward I falter again
[01:21.63]forgetting to breathe
[01:23.41]I need to sleep
[01:24.78]I'm getting nowhere
[01:27.25]
[01:27.51]all that I've missed I see in the reflection
[01:28.22]
[01:30.63]pass me while I wasn't paying attention
[01:33.60]tired of rushing, racing and running
[01:36.50]I'm falling apart
[01:39.09]

[02:23.27]the noise of the world is getting me caught up
[02:26.23]chasing the clock and i wish i could stop it
[02:29.13]just need to breathe
[02:30.73]somebody please
[02:32.77]slow me down
