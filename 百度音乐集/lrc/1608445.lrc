[00:04.16]聯合公園.Numb
[00:12.81]
[00:22.13]I'm tired of being what you want me to be
[00:25.85]feeling so faithless
[00:27.65]lost under the surface
[00:30.58]I don't know what you're expecting of me
[00:34.09]put under the pressure
[00:36.48]of walking in your shoes
[00:39.43]
[00:39.88](Caught in the undertow
[00:41.69]just caught in the undertow)
[00:42.91]Every step that I take is
[00:45.06]another mistake to you
[00:47.97](Caught in the undertow
[00:49.70]just caught in the undertow)
[00:51.36]
[00:51.97]I've become so numb
[00:54.73]I can't feel you there
[00:56.87]I've become so tired
[00:58.98]so much more aware
[01:01.25]I'm becoming this
[01:03.50]all I want to do
[01:05.54]is be more like me
[01:07.78]and be less like you
[01:09.60]
[01:10.32]Can't you see that you're smothering me
[01:13.74]holding too tightly
[01:15.81]afraid to lose control
[01:18.49]'cause everything that you thought I would be
[01:22.11]has fallen apart right in front of you
[01:27.37]
[01:27.73](Caught in the undertow
[01:28.89]just caught in the undertow)
[01:30.68]every step that I take is
[01:32.93]another mistake to you
[01:35.68](Caught in the undertow
[01:37.51]just caught in the undertow)
[01:39.57]and every second I waste
[01:41.73]is more than I can take
[01:44.30]
[01:44.63]I've become so numb
[01:47.01]I can't feel you there
[01:49.21]I've become so tired
[01:51.37]so much more aware
[01:53.61]I'm becoming this
[01:55.77]all I want to do
[01:57.90]is be more like me
[02:00.14]and be less like you
[02:01.87]
[02:03.17]And I know
[02:05.34]I may end up failing too
[02:11.72]but I know
[02:14.30]you were just like me
[02:16.40]with someone disappointed in you
[02:21.09]
[02:21.39]I've become so numb
[02:24.15]I can't feel you there
[02:26.32]I've become so tired
[02:28.46]so much more aware
[02:30.73]I'm becoming this
[02:32.89]all I want to do
[02:34.99]is be more like me
[02:39.05]and be less like you
[02:39.77]
[02:40.27]I've become so numb
[02:41.61]I can't feel you there
[02:43.84](tired of being what you want me to be)
[02:47.57]I've become so numb
[02:50.36]I can't feel you there
[02:52.45](tired of being what you want me to be)
