[00:00.00]Drift Away
[00:00.48]Artist: The Kinks
[00:01.65]
[00:03.66]Drift away, just drift away
[00:09.49]Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
[00:27.30]Album: Phobia
[00:30.70]They say there's gonna be a river of blood
[00:35.30]It's apocalypse now
[00:40.17]So we're waiting for the flood
[00:43.28]The ice is gonna melt, the water gonna rise
[00:49.92]And we'll all go to hell
[00:51.83]So they're keeping us advised
[00:53.67]While the dollar falls down
[00:55.54]The yen gonna climb
[00:57.53]It's a moral decline
[00:59.52]And I'm losing my mind
[01:01.00]
[01:01.01]I think I'll just drift away
[01:05.77]To that island of my dreams
[01:08.94]Live in total fantasy
[01:12.63]Close my eyes and drift away
[01:16.82]
[01:16.90]Back in the real world
[01:18.92]There's tension everywhere
[01:21.38]And the smell of fear
[01:26.56]Keeps hanging around and polluting the air
[01:31.80]The man on the news is going over the top
[01:35.67]Now he'll say anything so his show don't flop
[01:39.42]Wall Street's down, so what
[01:41.89]And according to astute market analysis
[01:45.73]The world's gonna stop
[01:47.79]they shout the story to the nation
[01:51.53]Pass on the panic to the population
[01:54.74]This is the end of civilization
[01:59.34]It's all over now
[02:06.25]
[02:07.41]Meanwhile, I just drift away
[02:11.69]To my island in the sun
[02:14.49]Imaginary paradise, perfection
[02:18.64]Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
[02:22.82]Drift away (drift away)
[02:26.64]Drift away (drift away)
[02:30.38]Drift away (drift away)
[02:35.21]
[02:37.59]Now all the politicians are running out of hope
[02:41.73]They've burned all their bridges
[02:43.22]Now they just can't cope
[02:45.13]And who do we blame now we're all going broke?
[02:48.80]It's that man over there
[02:51.09]Who's hanging from a rope
[02:53.36]Newsmen winding up the nation
[02:56.78]A little bad news helps circulation
[03:01.20]Pass on the panic to the population
[03:04.66]It's all over, it's all over
[03:12.58]It's all over now
[03:18.04]
[03:20.06]Times like this, I just drift away
[03:24.70]To my tropical fantasy
[03:27.65]Living on coconuts growing on the trees
[03:33.42]Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
[03:38.64]Drift away, drift away, drift away
[03:52.35]It's apocalypse now, drift away
[03:56.52]Rivers of blood, drift away
[04:00.10]And the man on the news is going over the top
[04:04.98]
[04:09.06]Sometimes I just drift away
[04:13.19]To my island in the sun
[04:16.87]Imaginary paradise, perfection
[04:21.43]Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
[04:25.19]Drift away (drift away)
[04:28.15]Drift away (drift away)
[04:32.05]Drift away (drift away)
