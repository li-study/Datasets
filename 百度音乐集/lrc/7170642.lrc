[00:00.00]Here To Stay
[00:04.05]Lenka
[00:07.00]
[00:11.60]I don't know anymore
[00:14.83]I don't know what I've been fighting for
[00:19.52]But something inside me won't go quietly
[00:23.64]
[00:27.73]And I could be anywhere
[00:30.22]'Cause we're all breathing the same air
[00:35.50]It goes inside and makes me feels alive
[00:39.66]And all I can say is all I can say
[00:43.28]I am here and I will be
[00:47.48]Following my own way
[00:48.97]Forever and a day
[00:51.27]I am here and I'm here to stay
[00:55.71]
[00:58.52]Oh we are here and we will be
[01:03.05]Following our own way
[01:04.57]No matter what you say
[01:06.64]We are here and we're here to stay
[01:11.15]We are here to stay
[01:14.54]
[01:21.83]No matter where you roam
[01:23.71]
[01:25.53]Anywhere you lay your heart's your home
[01:29.11]Stand your ground if they push you down
[01:32.64]Because all you can say is all you can say
[01:36.46]
[01:37.50]We are here and we will be
[01:40.88]Following our own way
[01:42.49]No matter what you say
[01:44.31]We are here and we're here to stay
[01:48.64]
[01:52.69]We are real and we feel it
[01:55.82]When you deny us
[01:57.40]Or when you get tired of us
[01:59.68]We are here and we're here to stay
[02:03.86]We are here to stay
[02:07.43]
[02:21.53]I never knew when enough was enough
[02:25.01]Or whether to stay when the going was tough
[02:28.32]But I won't let a little heart be afraid
[02:31.79]And all I can say is all I can say
[02:35.44]
[02:36.87]I am here and I will be
[02:40.14]Following my own way
[02:42.22]Forever and a day
[02:43.88]I am here and I'm here to stay
[02:48.38]
[02:51.42]Oh, we are here and we will be
[02:55.54]Following our own way
[02:57.29]No matter what you say
[02:59.00]We are here and we're here to stay
[03:03.57]We are here to stay
[03:08.46]We are here to stay
[03:11.91]We are here to stay
[03:16.07]We are here to stay
[03:18.49]
