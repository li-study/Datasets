[00:00.00]Bellefire - I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me
[00:03.45]Album: Spin the Wheel
[00:06.49][00:13.62][03:15.21][03:27.88]
[00:17.27]I hear you're taking the town again
[00:22.83]Having a good time with all your good time friends
[00:29.38]I don't think that you think of me
[00:34.25]You're on your own now
[00:37.22]And I'm alone and free
[00:41.47]I know that I should get on with my life
[00:46.56]But a life lived without you could never be right
[00:51.90][02:29.92]As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
[00:58.26]Long as the rivers run to the sea
[01:03.68][02:00.97][02:42.44][02:51.65]I'll never get over you getting over me
[01:14.64]I try to smile so the hurt won't show
[01:20.12]Tell everybody I was glad to see you go
[01:26.57]But the tears just won't go away
[01:31.60]Loneliness found me, looks like it's here to stay
[01:38.68]I know that I ought to find someone new
[01:43.68]But all I find is myself always thinking of you
[01:49.34]And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens
[01:55.44][02:37.09]Long as the rivers run to the sea
[02:09.82]No matter what I do
[02:12.18]Each night's a lifetime to live through
[02:15.31]I can't go on like this
[02:18.87]I need your touch
[02:23.77]You're the only one I'll ever love
[02:57.17]Never get over you getting over
[03:04.25]I'll never get over you getting over me
