[00:23.05]I'm leavin' my fam'ly
[00:26.26]Leavin' all my friends
[00:30.53]My body's at home
[00:33.12]But my heart's in the wind
[00:36.34]Where the clouds are like headlines
[00:41.08]On a new front page sky
[00:45.56]My tears are salt water
[00:48.60]And the moon's full and high
[00:55.53]And I know Martin Eden's
[00:58.55]Gonna be proud of me
[01:03.53]And many before me
[01:05.95]Who've been called by the sea
[01:09.88]To be up in the crow's nest
[01:14.25]Singin' my say
[01:18.82]Shiver me Timbers
[01:21.49]'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
[01:27.31]And the fog's liftin'
[01:29.66]And the sand's shiftin'
[01:31.99]I'm driftin' on out
[01:35.37]Ol' Captain Ahab
[01:39.03]He ain't got nothin' on me, now.
[01:43.59]So swallow me, don't follow me
[01:47.40]I'm trav'lin' alone
[01:50.49]Blue water's my daughter
[01:54.18]'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
[02:17.02]So please call my missus
[02:20.29]Gotta tell her not to cry
[02:24.57]'Cause my goodbye is written
[02:26.96]By the moon in the sky
[02:30.10]Hey and nobody knows me
[02:34.75]I can't fathom my stayin'
[02:39.59]Shiver me timbers
[02:42.17]'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
[02:48.09]And the fog's liftin'
[02:50.73]And the sand's shiftin'
[02:52.75]I'm driftin' on out
[02:56.36]Ol' Captain Ahab
[02:59.54]He ain't got nothin' on me
[03:03.06]So come and swallow me, follow me
[03:08.47]I'm trav'lin' alone
[03:11.81]Blue water's my daughter
[03:14.86]'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
[03:18.68]And I'm leavin' my family
[03:23.76]Leavin' all my friends
[03:27.99]My body's at home
[03:30.19]But my heart's in the wind
[03:33.48]Where the clouds are like headlines
[03:38.41]Upon a new front page sky
[03:44.92]And shiver me timbers
[03:48.45]'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
