[00:01.94]What Ive Done
[00:05.16]Linkin Park
[00:09.14]
[01:29.35]In this farewell
[01:32.29]There's no blood
[01:34.21]There's no alibi
[01:37.15]'Cause I've drawn regret
[01:40.01]From the truth
[01:42.23]Of a thousand lies
[01:44.42]
[01:45.21]So let mercy come
[01:48.82]And wash away
[01:52.67]What I've done
[01:56.67]I'll face myself
[01:59.26]To cross out what I've become
[02:04.72]Erase myself
[02:07.03]And let go of what I've done
[02:12.21]Put to rest
[02:14.05]What you thought of me
[02:16.74]While I clean this slate
[02:20.11]With the hands of uncertainty
[02:24.51]
[02:25.07]So let mercy come
[02:28.78]And wash away
[02:32.73]What I've done
[02:36.86]I'll face myself
[02:39.08]To cross out what I've become
[02:44.91]Erase myself
[02:47.11]And let go of what I've done
[02:54.78]
[03:08.81]For what I've done
[03:12.92]I start again
[03:15.12]And whatever pain may come
[03:18.66]Today this ends
[03:22.95]I'm forgiving what I've done!!!
[03:30.79]I'll face myself
[03:33.03]To cross out what I've become
[03:36.71]Erase myself
[03:40.95]And let go of what I've done
[03:45.46]
[03:51.23]What I've done
[03:57.25]Forgiving what I've done
