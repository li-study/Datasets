[00:01.12]Hawk Nelson - Never Enough
[00:05.89]
[00:15.78]Some days I spend all day on the phone
[00:22.69]And other days I would just rather be alone
[00:29.59]Some days I feel like the whole world is waiting on an answer
[00:35.81]I've been caught under the radar so help me please
[01:26.23][00:40.85]It's been that kind of day so just go away
[01:29.01][00:43.77]And let the machine say what I want it to say
[01:32.77][00:47.56]It's never enough, it keeps getting tough
[01:36.02][00:50.95]I wanna listen to your voice but it keeps breaking up
[00:58.12]
[01:00.95]Some days I just don't wanna leave my home
[01:07.99]And other days I'm alive like a rolling stone
[01:14.85]Sometimes I feel so insignificant like it doesn't really even matter
[01:21.35]And I know that we all make mistakes
[01:39.42]
[02:10.83][01:39.70]'Cause I'm guilty as charged with a case of foot in mouth disease
[02:17.51][01:46.30]So help me see clearly as I try to just get myself
[02:21.19][01:50.94]to a place where my lens can adjust
[02:25.44][01:53.58]
