[ti:A Thousand Years]
[ar:Sting]
[al:]

[01:28.72]A thousand years, a thousand more,
[01:31.28]A thousand times a million doors to eternity
[01:39.34]I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
[01:42.86]An endless turning stairway climbs
[01:46.11]To a tower of souls
[01:51.64]If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,
[01:55.01]The towers rise to numberless floors in space
[02:03.31]I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
[02:06.94]A million names but only one truth to face
[02:11.13]
[02:21.74]A million roads, a million fears
[02:24.21]A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
[02:32.32]I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
[02:35.84]A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
[02:43.92]But if there was a single truth, a single light
[02:47.47]A single thought, a singular touch of grace
[02:55.79]Then following this single point , this single flame,
[02:59.33]The single haunted memory of your face
[03:04.93]
[03:08.20]I still love you
[03:19.56]I still want you
[03:31.61]A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
[03:36.03]Like galaxies in my head
[03:38.72]
[03:55.73]I may be numberless, I may be innocent
[04:01.26]I may know many things, I may be ignorant
[04:07.23]Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
[04:12.94]Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
[04:18.91]I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
[04:24.67]Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
[04:30.58]Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
[04:36.25]I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
[04:41.54]I still love you
[04:53.38]I still want you
[05:05.49]A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
[05:09.57]Like galaxies in my head
[05:12.72]
[05:17.56]On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
[05:21.39]Eternities still unsaid
[05:25.93]Till you love me
