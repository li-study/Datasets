[00:24.07]Even when you're here with me
[00:28.28]I know that you so well
[00:32.64]
[00:33.55]So put another record on
[00:35.73]Kiss and leave me on
[00:37.99]Nothing really matters when we're dancing
[00:41.55]Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
[00:46.42]Cause every time we come this close,
[00:48.77]my heart skips, skips a beat
[00:51.85]
[00:52.40]So come on, spin me around
[00:54.50]I don't wanna go home
