[00:06.32]Under The Surface
[00:06.53]Marit Larsen
[00:06.73]
[00:11.45]It’s such a funny sensation to be
[00:15.60]so happy that you wanna die
[00:20.22]Promises always were crazy to me
[00:24.56]But never was I so surprised
[00:28.77]
[00:29.27]Minutes are longer when we are apart
[00:33.50]Your presence’s more than I can handle
[00:38.05]It’s come to the point where I wonder if I could ever be luckier
[00:44.68]When suddenly I’m back at the core
[00:50.33]Thinking of her who had you before
[00:54.75]Were you as good
[00:57.03]As good as we are
[00:59.32]Do you remember
[01:03.80]Did you love her the way you love me
[01:08.79]Is there a chance that there might be
[01:12.88]traces of her that you carry under the surface
[01:24.73]
[01:31.78]Lend me your ears, I would like to confess
[01:36.21]I’m doubting that you can be real
[01:41.00]By your side wearing a beautiful dress
[01:45.13]I celebrate how good it feels
[01:49.37]Say that you love me, say that it’s true
[01:54.13]I know that I want to believe you
[01:58.42]But somehow silence speaks louder than words
[02:03.04]I’m worried she’s still on your mind
[02:06.59]Suddenly I’m back at the core
[02:10.91]Thinking of her who had you before
[02:15.32]Were you as good
[02:17.83]As good as we are
[02:20.15]Do you remember
[02:24.40]Did you love her the way you love me
[02:29.34]Is there a chance that there might be
[02:33.49]traces of her that you carry under the surface
[02:44.92]
[03:00.37]Mmm I know that I’m selfish
[03:03.10]I know that it’s bad
[03:05.61]I know, but it’s driving me mad
[03:09.05]It’s driving me mad
[03:13.59]Suddenly I’m back at the core
[03:18.14]Thinking of her who had you before
[03:22.42]Were you as good
[03:24.68]As good as we are
[03:26.98]Do you remember
[03:31.78]Did you love her the way you love me
[03:36.61]Is there a chance that there might be
[03:40.75]traces of her that you carry under the surface
[03:49.75]under the surface
[03:54.23]under the surface
[03:58.46]
