[00:00.00]Save me from drowning in the sea
[00:05.24]Beat me up on the beach
[00:10.38]What a lovely holiday
[00:12.85]There's nothing funny left to say
[00:19.79]This sombre song would drain the sun
[00:24.64]But it won't shine until it's sung
[00:29.27]No water running in the stream
[00:32.02]The saddest place we've ever been
[00:38.49]Everything I touched was golden
[00:42.06]Everything I loved got broken
[00:44.09]On the road to Mandalay
[00:48.62]Every mistake I've ever made
[00:50.87]Has been rehashed and then replayed
[00:53.80]As I got lost along the way
[02:14.29][00:57.15]
[01:17.54]There's nothing left for you to give
[01:22.25]The truth is all that you're left with
[01:26.77]Twenty paces then at dawn
[01:29.86]We will die and be reborn
[01:35.67]I like to sleep beneath the trees
[01:41.45]Have the universe at one with me
[01:46.35]Look down the barrel of a gun
[01:48.99]And feel the Moon replace the Sun
[01:55.95]Everything we've ever stolen
[01:58.64]Has been lost returned or broken
[02:01.24]No more dragons left to slay
[02:05.80]Every mistake I've ever made
[02:07.96]Has been rehashed and then replayed
[02:10.53]As I got lost along the way
[03:32.33]Save me from drowning in the sea
[03:36.59]Beat me up on the beach
[03:42.05]What a lovely holiday
[03:44.74]There's nothing funny left to say.
