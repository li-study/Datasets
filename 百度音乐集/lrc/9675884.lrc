[00:03.46]Miael Jackson
[00:04.78]
[00:16.02]Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
[00:19.85]She only knows how low that she can go
[00:23.20]She speaks the lines that can control my mind
[00:26.86]Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
[00:30.32]She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
[00:33.67]Only for me, then spoke with her body
[00:37.22]Her only goal is just to take control
[00:40.88]And I can't believe that I can't tell her no
[00:42.81]
[00:44.73]That girl I can't take her
[00:47.54]Should have known she was a heartbreaker
[00:51.14]That girl I can't take her
[00:54.85]Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
[00:58.25]That girl I can't take her
[01:01.71]Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
[01:05.26]That girl I can't take her
[01:08.16]Should have seen right through her
[01:10.62]She's a heartbreaker
[01:12.32]She plays a game with such an innocent face
[01:15.78]I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
[01:19.13]Her actions confess and put me through the test
[01:22.63]I was surprised that I was caught inside
[01:26.19]Now she's thinking that I will never know
[01:29.70]And she'll keep playing until I let her go
[01:33.15]But I hope in time that she will finally realize
[01:36.65]I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same
[01:40.65]That girl I can't take her
[01:43.61]Should have known she was a heartbreaker
[01:46.71]That girl I can't take her
[01:50.57]Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
[01:54.58]That girl I can't take her
[01:57.57]Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
[02:01.64]That girl I can't take her
[02:04.44]Should have seen right through her
[02:07.33]
[02:09.07]I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you
[02:12.92]Stop being without you
[02:15.97]But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
[02:20.38]And start being without you
[02:23.33]But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you
[02:27.01]And stop talkin' about you
[02:28.78]And what will she say?
[02:33.88]She will say I was the man that got away
[02:36.78]
