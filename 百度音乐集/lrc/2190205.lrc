[00:-2.00]Miley Cyrus - Full Circle
[00:-1.00]

[00:03.00]
[00:03.56]I’ve been in a rut
[00:04.85]Back and forth enough
[00:05.93]Heart like the wheel
[00:10.08]Without you around
[00:11.22]So uncomfortable is how it feels
[00:14.32]
[00:15.11]Every time you’re near
[00:16.23]Trouble disappears
[00:17.47]Under the ground
[00:21.64]But when you go too far
[00:22.79]Silver clouds will start hanging around
[00:25.93]
[00:29.07]And I know why
[00:32.87]Try to run
[00:35.26]But I keep on
[00:37.30]Coming back
[00:38.76]Full circle
[00:39.63]And I can’t jump the track
[00:41.91]Can’t let you go
[00:46.33]
[00:46.62]Tried to once
[00:48.46]So I keep on
[00:50.45]Coming back
[00:51.91]Full circle
[00:52.75]‘Cause I know you’ll come around
[00:55.43]You’ll come around
[00:57.75]
[00:59.46]Skippin' down a broken path
[01:00.98]How long can I last
[01:02.09]Please let me know
[01:06.34]Where’s the finish line
[01:07.57]‘Cause I’ve got to find somewhere to go
[01:10.98]
[01:11.50]I don’t want to hear
[01:12.51]These people interfere
[01:13.70]What do they know
[01:17.95]What I feel inside
[01:19.02]When I’m up all night
[01:20.33]Needing you oh…
[01:22.69]
[01:25.39]I don’t know why
[01:29.60]Tried to run
[01:31.56]But I keep on
[01:33.77]Coming back
[01:34.94]Full circle
[01:35.90]And I can’t jump the track
[01:38.07]Can’t let you go
[01:42.77]
[01:43.13]Tried to once
[01:44.68]So I keep on
[01:46.82]Coming back
[01:48.12]Full circle
[01:48.98]‘Cause I know you’ll come around
[01:51.38]You’ll come around
[01:54.00]
[01:55.84]‘Cause I know you’ll come around
[01:58.12]You’ll come around
[02:00.71]
[02:02.71]I'll keep on runnin’
[02:03.96]Til we meet in the middle
[02:09.19]I'll push it right aside
[02:10.52]And I give just a little
[02:15.79]There’s miles to go
[02:17.36]But wait
[02:18.28]Don’t hold back
[02:19.37]We’ll make it
[02:21.61]
[02:25.05]And I know why
[02:28.99]Tried to run
[02:31.17]But I keep on
[02:33.00]Coming back
[02:34.37]Full circle
[02:35.27]And I can’t jump the track
[02:37.87]Can’t let you go
[02:39.92]
[02:41.23]Tried to once
[02:42.63]So I keep on
[02:44.59]Coming back
[02:45.92]Full circle
[02:47.00]‘Cause I know you’ll come around
[02:49.26]You’ll come around
[02:52.05]
[02:53.83]I know you’ll come around
[02:55.98]You’ll come around
[02:59.93]
[03:00.71]Yeah I know you’ll come around
[03:02.63]You’ll come around
[03:06.33]
