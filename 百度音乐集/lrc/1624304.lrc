[00:08.43]I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three.
[00:17.55]Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me. he said,
[00:26.83]\boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
[00:35.45]Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but i loved your grandma so.\<br>
[00:43.92]We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.
[00:52.86]Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.
[01:02.02]But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
[01:11.44]Of her, i found this letter, and this is what it said:
[01:20.18]If you get there before i do, don't give up on me.
[01:28.99]I'll meet you when my chores are through;
[01:33.47]I don't know how long i'll be.
[01:37.63]But i'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
[01:46.54]And between now and then, till i see you again,
[01:51.07]I'll be loving you. love, me.
[02:04.97]I read those words just hours before my grandma passed away,
[02:13.91]In the doorway of a church where me and grandpa stopped to pray.
[02:23.09]I know i'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;
[02:31.76]But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.
[02:40.52]If you get there before i do, don't give up on me.
[02:50.63]I'll meet you when my chores are through;
[02:55.46]I don't know how long i'll be.
[02:59.56]But i'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
[03:08.81]And between now and then, till i see you again,
[03:15.96]I'll be loving you. love, me.
[03:23.07]Between now and then, till i see you again,
[03:26.78]I'll be loving you. love, me.
