[00:08.54] { A kind of magic ! }
[00:12.08]One dream, one soul,
[00:15.69]one prize, one goal.
[00:19.38]One golden glance
[00:22.91]of what should be.
[00:25.12]{ It's a kind of magic ! }
[00:26.59]One shaft of light
[00:30.02]that shows the way.
[00:33.73]No mortal man can win this day.
[00:39.75]{ It's a kind of magic ! }
[00:41.51]The bell that rings
[00:44.84]inside your mind.

[00:52.51]the doors of time.

[01:03.69]The day will dawn of sanity.
[01:10.80]It's a kind of magic.
[01:16.23]{ It's a kind of magic ! }
[01:18.16]There can be only one.
[01:22.99]<Music>
[01:25.72]This rage that lasts
[01:28.93]a thousand years
[01:32.41]will soon be gone.
[01:36.87]This flame that burns
[01:40.03]inside of me.
[01:43.47]I'm hearing secret harmonies.
[01:50.19] { It's a kind of magic ! }
[01:51.74]The bell that rings
[01:55.04]inside your mind
[01:58.86]is challenging the doors of time.
