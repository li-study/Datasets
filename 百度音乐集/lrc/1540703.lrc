[00:01.03]Duffy -- Wawick Avenue
[00:10.77]When I get to Warwick Avenue
[00:16.31]Meet me by the entrance of the Tube
[00:21.98]We can talk things over a little time
[00:27.71]Promise me you won’t stay by the light
[00:33.34]When I get to Warwick Avenue
[00:39.02]Please drop the past and be true
[00:44.61]Don’t think we’re okay just because I’m here
[00:50.31]You hurt me bad but I won’t shed a tear
[00:56.89]I’m leaving you for the last time, baby
[01:03.01]You think you’re loving but you don’t love me
[01:08.44]I’ve been confused outta my mind lately
[01:14.43]You think you’re loving but I want to be free
[01:19.81]Baby you’ve hurt me
[01:31.55]When I get to Warwick Avenue
[01:37.83]We’ll spend an hour, but no more than two
[01:42.82]Our only chance to speak once more
[01:48.49]I showed you the answers, now here’s the door
[01:54.12]When I get to Warwick Avenue
[01:59.83]I’ll tell you baby, that we’re through
[02:06.44]I’m leaving you for the last time, baby
[02:12.58]You think you’re loving but you don’t love me
[02:17.80]I’ve been confused outta my mind lately
[02:23.98]You think you’re loving but you don’t love me
[02:28.93]I want to be free
[02:31.75]Baby you’ve hurt me
[02:36.62]All the days spent together, I wish for better
[02:43.41]But I didn’t want the train to come
[02:46.07]Now it’s departed, I’m broken hearted
[02:51.80]Seems like we never started
[02:53.48]All those days spent together, when I wished for better
[03:00.46]And I didn’t want the train to come
[03:22.41]You think you’re loving but you don’t love me
[03:26.70]I want to be free
[03:29.53]Baby you’ve hurt me
[03:32.73]You don’t love me
[03:35.12]I want to be free
[03:37.96]Baby you’ve hurt me
