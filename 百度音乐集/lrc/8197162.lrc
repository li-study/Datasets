[00:02.63]Come Clean
[00:07.71]
[00:07.79]Let's go back
[00:11.07]Back to the beginning
[00:15.18]Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned
[00:22.83]
[00:23.77]'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
[00:31.02]Trying to fit a square into a circle
[00:35.45]Was no life
[00:38.34]I defy
[00:43.74]
[02:36.00][01:47.49][00:44.01]Let the rain fall down
[02:37.64][01:50.13][00:46.45]And wake my dreams
[02:39.06][01:51.66][00:48.12]Let it wash away
[02:41.54][01:54.10][00:50.45]My sanity
[02:43.13][01:55.67][00:52.07]'Cause i wanna feel the thunder
[02:45.67][01:58.15][00:54.57]I wanna scream
[02:47.16][01:59.75][00:56.23]Let the rain fall down
[02:49.67][02:02.25][00:58.21]I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean
[01:07.36]
[01:11.59]I'm shedding
[01:15.01]Shedding every color
[01:18.38]Trying to find a pigment of truth
[01:22.09]Beneath my skin
[01:26.53]'Cause different
[01:30.93]Doesn't feel so different
[01:34.88]And going out is better
[01:38.05]Than always staying in
[01:42.28]Feel the wind
[01:46.66]
[02:15.00]I'm coming clean
[02:24.03]Let the rain fall
[02:28.13]Let the rain fall
[02:30.27]I'm coming clean
[02:59.78]
[03:18.06]Let's go back
[03:21.18]Back to the beginning
