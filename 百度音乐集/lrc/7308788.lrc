[00:01.12]The Ready Set - Love Like Woe
[00:02.21]
[00:04.74](J-J-J-J-JR)
[00:05.77]Whoa-oh, oh, oh.
[00:08.55]Whoa-oh, oh, oh.
[00:11.06]I kinda feel like it don't make sense.
[00:16.03]
[00:16.39]I'm thinking baby, you and I are undeniable
[00:18.57]But I'm finding out love's unreliable.
[00:21.63]I'm giving all I got to make you stay.
[00:24.37]Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
[00:26.52]
[00:26.99]'Cause you're a pretty little wind storm out on the boulevard.
[00:29.81]Something like a sunset,
[00:31.10]Oh, you're a shooting star.
[00:32.53]And I might drive myself insane,
[00:35.01]If those lips aren't speaking my name.
[00:37.28]
[00:37.73]'Cause I've got some intuition-
[00:38.87]Or maybe I'm superstitious,
[00:40.16]But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
[00:43.83]To counter this addiction.
[00:45.68]You got me on a mission.
[00:46.46]Tell me, darling, can I get a break somehow?
[00:48.27]
[00:48.68](How) could I say no?
[00:52.74]She's got a love like woe. (whoa-oh, oh, oh)
[00:55.44]Girl's got a love like woe. (la da da)
[00:58.98]I kinda feel like it don't make sense
[01:01.21]Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again.
[01:04.57]Love so strong, then you moved on.
[01:09.52]Now I'm hung up in suspense,
[01:12.15]Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again.
[01:15.08]
[01:15.41]It's like a hurricane, speed train
[01:17.12]She's a moving car.
[01:18.10]Catch her in the fast lane,
[01:19.48]Oh, I gotta know:
[01:20.58]Can I keep up with her pace?
[01:22.37]Kickin' into gear when I see that face.
[01:25.42]
[01:25.80]You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
[01:28.51]That can make a storm cloud break, pullin' out the sun.
[01:31.10]And I can't get caught in the rain.
[01:33.71]Can I get your lips to speak my name?
[01:36.02]
[01:36.43]'Cause I've got some intuition-
[01:37.55]Or maybe I'm superstitious,
[01:38.87]But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
[01:42.51]To counter this addiction.
[01:43.85]You got me on a mission.
[01:45.07]Tell me, darling, can I get a break somehow?
[01:46.85]
[01:47.22](How) could I say no?
[01:51.38]She's got a love like woe. (whoa-oh, oh, oh)
[01:54.09]Girl's got a love like woe. (la da da)
[01:57.61]I kinda feel like it don't make sense
[01:59.80]Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again.
[02:03.10]Love so strong, then you moved on.
[02:08.08]Now I'm hung up in suspense,
[02:11.14]Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again.
[02:13.77]
[02:14.05]'Cause we only have one life.
[02:17.75]The timing and the moment all seem just right.
[02:22.87]So would you say you're mine?
[02:26.29](We'll be just fine.)
[02:28.61]Would you say you're mine?
[02:31.33](We'll be just fine.)
[02:34.07]
[02:34.40]She's got a love like woe. (whoa-oh, oh, oh)
[02:36.66]Girl's got a love like woe. (la da da)
[02:40.29]I kinda feel like it don't make sense
[02:42.79]Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again.
[02:45.90]Love so strong, then you moved on.
[02:50.81]Now I'm hung up in suspense,
[02:53.24]Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again.
[02:55.84]
[02:56.21]She's got a love like woe. (whoa-oh, oh, oh)
[02:58.15]Girl's got a love like woe. (la da da)
[03:01.56]I kinda feel like it don't make sense
[03:04.10]Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again.
[03:07.19]Love so strong, then you moved on.
[03:12.20]Now I'm hung up in suspense,
[03:14.75]Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again.
