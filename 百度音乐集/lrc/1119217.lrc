[01:02.04]The rain every damn day's the same shade of grey
[01:04.55]
[01:04.65]Ey, I used to have a little bit of a plan
[01:06.41]Used to have a concept to where I stand

[01:45.20]That you would selfdestruct eventually
[01:47.34]Now I' thinking like the mistake
[01:49.54]A m- doesn't hurt

[01:54.26]And now this guilt is really all that I got
[01:55.33]
[01:56.51]Oh, you turn your back and walk away in shame
[01:59.01]All you got is a memory and pain
[02:00.87]Nothing makes sense, you just stare at the ground
[02:02.72]You hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
[02:05.55]What do I have to say?
[02:06.93]Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
[02:09.64]I whatever's gonna happen to you
