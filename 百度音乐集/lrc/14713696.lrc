[00:08.57]It starts with a picture
[00:11.93]And it sits in your frame
[00:14.04]And we part with a letter
[00:16.28]And it ends in my name
[00:18.35]It starts with forever
[00:20.63]And it ends with a touch
[00:22.82]And I know that you're clever
[00:24.88]And I don't ask for much
[00:28.11]Maybe we forgot all the things were when are together
[00:37.77]You said I'm arresting
[00:40.46]You said I had heat
[00:42.54]I really tohught that we would go further
[00:44.67]The second time we'd meet
[00:46.95]Now I'm tired of trying to keep you
[00:49.17]All I want to do is sleep
[00:51.21]But perhaps when I'm sleeping
[00:53.52]You'll get back on your feet
[00:56.76]Maybe we forgot all the things we were when we were together

[03:06.64][02:48.88][02:09.26][01:12.00]Stop my fall
[03:22.79][03:09.45][02:51.79][02:12.07][01:14.78]Everytime you go
[03:10.98][02:53.38][02:13.65][01:16.18]Tape me up
[03:13.17][02:55.30][02:15.36][01:18.59]Then break me up
[03:15.94][02:58.02][02:18.60][01:21.61]Ever so gently
[03:18.23][03:00.34][02:21.06][01:23.64]When I'm my weakest
[03:19.96][02:23.04][01:25.81]Then it's not so hard
[01:28.03]Every time you go
[02:35.21][02:30.75][02:26.63]Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?
[02:41.04]Maybe we forgot
