[00:-2.00]The Fray - You Found Me
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:05.27]I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
[00:11.40]Where the west was all but won
[00:17.63]All along smoking his last cigarette
[00:23.59]I said, where've you been?
[00:26.89]He said, ask anything.
[00:30.00]
[00:30.65]Where were you?
[00:33.31]When everything was falling apart.
[00:36.81]All my days spent by the telephone.
[00:42.83]And all I needed was a call
[00:49.28]It never came
[00:52.20]To the corner of Firs tand Amistad
[00:56.63]
[00:57.38]Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
[01:03.49]Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
[01:09.90]Why'd you have to wait?
[01:13.49]Where were you? Where were you?
[01:16.43]Just a little late.
[01:19.76]You found me, you found me.
[01:23.70]
[01:27.22]But in the end
[01:30.39]Everyone ends up alone
[01:33.50]Losing hope
[01:36.31]The only one who's ever known
[01:39.72]Who I am, Who I'm not, Who I want to be
[01:45.63]No way to know
[01:48.94]How long she will be next to me
[01:53.58]
[01:54.28]Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
[02:00.17]Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
[02:06.60]Why'd you have to wait?
[02:10.05]Where were you? Where were you?
[02:13.16]Just a little late.
[02:16.54]You found me, you found me.
[02:24.51]
[02:30.43]Early morning
[02:33.47]The city breaks
[02:36.88]I’ve been calling for years and years…
[02:42.74]And you’ve never left me no messages
[02:45.72]Never sent me no letters
[02:48.77]You’ve got some kind of nerve
[02:52.09]Taking all I want
[02:56.87]
[02:57.49]Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
[03:03.50]Lying on the floor,
[03:07.24]Where were you? Where were you?
[03:09.70]
[03:10.19]Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
[03:16.15]Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
[03:22.59]Why'd you have to wait?
[03:25.93]Where were you? Where were you?
[03:29.00]Just a little late.
[03:32.27]You found me, you found me.
[03:40.13]
[03:41.63]Why'd you have to wait?
[03:45.01]You found me, you found me.
[03:49.83]
