[00:01.66][Chorus: x1]
[00:01.72]Niggas know what I'm about out here
[00:12.12]I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
[00:14.67]You can run your mouth, I don't care
[00:17.14]But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
[00:19.60]It's too real out here to be scared
[00:22.43]A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
[00:24.80]A man is the last thing you should fear
[00:27.20]It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
[00:30.18]We all die one day (Obie Trice...go!)
[00:31.11][Obie Trice]
[00:31.56]Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
[00:33.42]Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
[00:35.86]Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
[00:38.29]Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
[00:41.00]I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
[00:46.16]Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
[00:48.69]Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
[00:51.30]Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
[00:55.03]Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
[00:58.84]Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
[01:01.76]Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
[01:03.95]Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
[01:06.47]Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
[01:09.12]Trust in God? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
[01:11.94]I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
[01:14.95]Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
[01:16.98]A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
[01:21.59][Chorus: x1]
[01:21.95]Niggas Know what I'm about out here
[01:23.27]I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
[01:26.00]You can run your mouth I don't care
[01:28.95]But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
[01:30.84]It's too real out here to be scared
[01:33.49]A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
[01:36.13]A man is the last thing you should fear
[01:38.56]It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
[01:41.30]We all die one day
[01:43.04](Lloyd Banks)
[01:43.85][Lloyd Banks]
[01:44.18]But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
[01:45.63]And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
[01:47.58]Poverty will make your ass bet on words
[01:49.86]Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
[01:52.63]They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
[01:55.30]If that's the case, then get a bigger one
[01:57.55]You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
[02:00.05]That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
[02:02.78]I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
[02:04.98]Cop rings like Mike [Jordan], [Larry] Bird, Magic [Johnson] and them
[02:09.06]Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
[02:10.23]Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
[02:12.55]I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
[02:14.80]I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
[02:17.78]You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
[02:20.66]Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch)
[02:22.43][Chorus: x1]

[02:32.38]It's too real out here to be scared
[02:32.41]A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
[02:37.76]A man is the last thing you should fear
[02:39.44]It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you

[02:56.09]My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
[02:58.64]You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
[03:01.31]G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
[03:04.86]Ski masks and gloves: Consider this as a warning
[03:07.68]Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs

[04:40.74]I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
[04:43.35]And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die

[04:49.06]So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
[04:50.69]You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
[04:53.69]When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
