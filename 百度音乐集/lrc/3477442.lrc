[00:01.65]Where I'm Headed (Lene Marlin)
[00:06.29]
[00:08.95](I pass by)
[00:11.02](Don't dare to stop)
[00:16.87](I pass by)
[00:19.05](Don't dare to stop)
[00:24.09]
[00:32.14]I've got a suitcase in my hand
[00:34.15]Filled with stuff most precious to me
[00:36.35]Sidewalk brings my feet
[00:37.76]Wherever they're headed.
[00:40.59]There is no directions given
[00:42.19]Just some trust in human mind to rely on
[00:45.63]And to hold on to.
[00:48.64]Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
[00:52.89]Won't even count the days.
[00:56.55]One thing I sure know I won't move so fast
[01:00.82]My mind in complete haze.
[01:05.37]
[01:06.82]I pass by
[01:08.90]Don't dare to stop
[01:10.90]When there's someone I see
[01:12.92]There's no one here but me
[01:14.63]I'm fooled by something inside my head.
[01:18.83]If I lay down now
[01:20.94]I might seem kinda dead
[01:26.54]Just keep on wasting time.
[01:30.05]
[01:30.51]Scary thoughts and frightening sounds
[01:32.25]In my mind still I try avoid it
[01:34.31]Heading through this hope not one-way alley
[01:38.47]I can't really sense my surroundings
[01:40.25]Seems to be all dark around.
[01:42.17]Nothing there, to lighten up my way.
[01:46.21]Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
[01:50.95]Won't even count the days.
[01:54.41]One thing I sure know I won't move so fast.
[01:58.96]My mind is complete haze.

[02:26.80]I pass by
[02:29.15]Don't dare to stop
[02:33.01]
[02:34.52]I walk slow in secret
[02:36.29]Listening to the sound of steps.
[02:38.21]Imagination seems to go all crazy
[02:42.55]I've got all the time I need
[02:44.28]Wanna dream fulfil my wishes.
[02:46.09]Like this future already now been entered
[02:51.26]
[02:52.98]I pass by
[02:54.94]Don't dare to stop
[02:57.01]When there's someone I see

[03:00.71]I'm fooled by something inside my head
[03:04.83]If I lay down now
[03:06.94]I might seem kinda dead
[03:12.60]Just keep on wasting time.
