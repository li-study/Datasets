[00:00.60]Once upon a summertime if you recall
[00:09.81]We stopped beside then in a flower stall
[00:16.34]A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
[00:20.87]Was all I let you buy me
[00:28.35]Once upon a summertime just like today
[00:38.64]We laughed the happy afternoon away
[00:45.91]And stole a kiss in every street café
[00:54.33]
[00:57.92]You were sweeter than the blossom on the tree
[01:07.75]I was as proud as any girl could be
[01:14.86]As if the major had offered me the key, the key to paris
[01:27.36]Now another wintertime has come and gone
[01:38.24]The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
[01:45.36]And I remember when the vespers chime
[01:54.23]You loved me once upon a summertime
