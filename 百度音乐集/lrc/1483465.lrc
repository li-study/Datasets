[03:04.91][00:34.64]It’s early morning
[03:06.61][00:36.20]The sun comes out
[03:08.36][00:38.04]Last night was shaking
[03:10.42][00:39.91]And pretty loud
[03:12.28][00:41.78]My cat is purring
[03:14.20][00:44.12]And scratches my skin
[03:16.10][00:45.79]So what is wrong
[03:17.59][00:47.44]With another sin
[00:49.82]The bitch is hungry
[00:51.72]She needs to tell
[00:53.33]So give her inches
[00:55.37]And feed her well
[00:57.40]More days to come
[00:59.19]New places to go
[01:01.14]I’ve got to leave
[01:02.62]It’s time for a show
[01:07.90]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
[01:15.27]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
[01:25.01]My body is burning
[01:26.70]It starts to shout
[01:28.38]Desire is coming
[01:30.64]It breaks out loud
[01:32.41]Lust is in cages
[01:34.33]Till storm breaks loose
[01:36.26]Just have to make it
[01:38.16]With someone I choose
[03:20.27][01:40.18]The night is calling
[03:21.74][01:41.95]I have to go
[03:23.74][01:43.77]The wolf is hungry
[03:25.52][01:45.47]He runs the show
[03:27.49][01:47.52]He’s licking his lips
[03:29.29][01:49.10]He’s ready to win
[03:31.10][01:51.25]On the hunt tonight
[03:32.74][01:52.82]For love at first sting
[03:37.87][01:58.15]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
[03:45.37][02:05.55]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
[03:53.00][02:13.05]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
[04:00.67][02:20.76]Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
