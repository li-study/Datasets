[00:24.81]I know the feeling
[00:27.75]It is the real thing
[00:31.43]The essence of the truth
[00:45.55]The perfect moment
[00:48.55]That golden moment
[00:54.55]I know you feel it too
[01:09.20]I know the feeling
[01:12.43]It is the real thing
[01:15.47]You can't refuse the embrace...
[01:19.12]
[01:44.44]It's like the pattern below the skin
[01:47.40]You gotta reach out and pull it all in
[01:50.44]And you feel like you're too close
[01:53.48]So you swallow another dose
[01:56.87]The pinnacle of happiness
[02:00.13]Filling up your soul
[02:03.02]You don't think you can take any more
[02:05.94]You never wanna let go
[02:08.26]To touch the roots of experience
[02:11.18]The most basic ingredients
[02:14.35]To see the unseen glitter of life
[02:17.17]And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
[02:20.74]Cherish the certainly of now
[02:23.78]It kills you a bit at a time
[02:26.94]Cradle the inspiration
[02:29.90]It will leave you writhing on the floor...
[02:38.87]
[02:44.51]This is so unreal, what I feel
[02:48.00]This nourishment, life is bent
[02:50.94]Into a shape I can hold
[02:53.90]A twist of fate, all my own
[02:56.99]Just grit your teeth, make no sound
[02:59.91]Take a step away and look around
[03:02.99]Just clench your fist and close your eyes
[03:05.95]Look deep inside, hypnotize
[03:09.02]The whisper is but a shout
[03:11.87]That's what it is all about
[03:14.88]Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
[03:17.84]You will never let it slip away
[03:20.92]Like the sacred song that someone sings through you
[03:31.89]Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into
[03:43.89]Like the dream you know one day will come to life
[03:55.84]Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger
[04:07.19]It's the jewel of victory
[04:10.21]The chasm of misery
[04:13.36]And once you have bitten the core
[04:16.24]You will always know the flavor
[04:19.66]The split second of divinity
[04:22.77]You drink up the sky
[04:25.62]All of heaven is in your arms
[04:28.70]You know the reason why
[04:31.13]It's right there, all by itself
[04:34.16]And what you are, there is nothing else
[04:37.05]You're growing a life within a life
[04:40.13]The lips of wonder kiss you inside
[04:43.58]And when it's over the feeling remains
[04:46.54]It all comes down to this
[04:49.50]The smoke clears, I see what it is
[04:52.54]That made me feel this way...
[04:56.74]
[05:07.77]I know the feeling
[05:10.55]It is the real thing
[05:14.46]The essence of the truth
[05:28.02]The perfect moment
[05:31.43]That golden moment
[05:37.47]I know you feel it too
[05:52.29]I know the feeling
[05:55.48]It is the real thing
[05:58.67]You can't refuse the embrace...
[06:03.79]This is so unreal, what I feel
[06:07.40]Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
[06:10.36]Pump through your veins, can't explain
[06:13.40]The element that's everything
[06:16.36]Just clench your fist and close your eyes
[06:19.40]Look deep inside, hypnotize
[06:22.36]Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
[06:25.28]You will never let it slip away
[06:28.37]Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
[06:31.37]You will never let it slip away
[06:34.23]You will never let it slip away
[06:37.20]You will never let it slip away
[06:40.17]Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
[06:51.42]Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence
[07:03.42]Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
[07:15.34]Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending...
[07:24.91]I know
[07:37.75]
