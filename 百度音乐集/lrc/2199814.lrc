[00:35.94]Long ago and oh so far away
[00:46.00]I fell in love with you before the second show
[00:59.00]Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
[01:09.58]But you're not really there
[01:15.02]It's just the radio
[01:22.00]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[01:26.98]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[01:32.68]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[01:37.52]I love you I really do
[01:42.05]
[02:09.00]Loneliness such a sad affair
[02:19.51]And I can hardly wait to be with you again
[02:32.07]What to say to make you come again
[02:42.06]Come back to me again
[02:47.35]And play your sad guitar
[02:53.98]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[02:59.07]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[03:04.20]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[03:09.77]I love you I really do
[03:18.00]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[03:23.00]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[03:28.00]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[03:33.02]I love you I really do
