[00:27.37]I don’t wanna waste another day
[00:30.43]Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
[00:34.96]Yeah
[00:37.63]Cause I want you And I feel you
[00:41.42]Crawling underneath my skin
[00:44.26]Like a hunger like a burning
[00:47.74]To find a place I’ve never been
[00:50.83]Now I’m broken and I’m fading
[00:54.09]I’m half the man I thought I would be
[00:59.64]But you can have what’s left of me
[01:10.76]I’ve been dying inside
[01:14.83]Little by little
[01:16.88]No where to go but going out of my mind
[01:21.27]In endless circles
[01:23.29]Running from myself until
[01:26.35]You gave me a reason for standing still
[01:33.90]And I want you and I feel you
[01:37.32]Crawling underneath my skin
[01:40.25]Like a hunger like a burning
[01:43.69]To find a place I’ve never been
[01:46.66]Now I’m broken and I’m fading
[01:50.06]I’m half the man I thought I would be
[01:55.54]But you can have what’s left of me
[02:00.15]Falling faster
[02:01.56]Barely breathing
[02:03.20]Give me something to believe in
[02:06.43]Tell me it’s not all in my head
[02:17.49]

[02:32.49]]Make me whole once again
[02:38.00]Cause I want you and I feel you
[02:41.35]Crawling underneath my skin
[02:44.33]Like a hunger like a burning
[02:47.88]To find a place I’ve never been
[02:50.69]Now I’m broken and I’m fading
