[00:00.00]HIM - Gone With The Sin Lyrics
[00:01.00]
[00:02.30]I love your skin oh so white
[00:12.60]I love your touch cold as ice
[00:23.24]And I love every single tear you cry
[00:33.17]I just love the way you're losing your life
[00:44.15]Ohohohohoh my Baby, how beautiful you are
[00:54.55]Ohohohohoh my Darling, completely torn apart
[01:04.82]You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are
[01:15.02]You're gone with the sin my Darling
[01:25.40]I adore the dispair in your eyes
[01:35.93]I worship your lips once red as wine
[01:45.87]I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine
[01:56.27]I just love the way you're running out of life
[02:07.33]Ohohohohoh my Baby, how beautiful you are
[02:17.73]Ohohohohoh my Darling, completely torn apart
[02:27.89]You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are
[02:38.21]You're gone with the sin my Darling
[03:31.14]Ohohohohoh my Baby, how beautiful you are
[03:41.24]Ohohohohoh my Darling, completely torn apart
[03:51.74]You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are
[04:02.09]You're gone with the sin my Darling
[04:14:00]
