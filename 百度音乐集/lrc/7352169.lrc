[00:23.00]He deals the cards as a meditation
[00:29.00]And those he plays never suspect
[00:35.00]He doesn't play for the money he wins
[00:40.00]He doesn't play for respect
[00:46.00]He deals the cards to find the answer
[00:52.00]The sacred geometery of chance
[00:57.00]The hidden law of a probable outcome
[01:04.00]The numbers lead a dance
[01:09.00]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[01:15.00]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[01:20.00]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[01:26.00]But that's not the shape of my heart
[01:32.00]He may play the jack of diamonds
[01:38.00]He may lay the queen of spades
[01:43.00]He may conseal a king in his hand
[01:49.00]While the memory of it fades
[01:54.00]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[02:00.00]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[02:06.00]I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
[02:11.00]But that's not the shape of my heart
[02:17.00]But that's not the shape,shape of my heart
[02:54.00]And if i told you that i loved you
[02:59.00]You'd maybe think there's something wrong
[03:05.00]I'm not a man of too many faces
[03:11.00]The mask i wear is one
[03:17.00]Those who speak know nothing
[03:23.00]And find out to their cost
[03:27.00]Like those who curse their luck in too many places
[03:34.00]Are those who fear a lost
[03:40.00]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[03:45.00]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[03:50.00]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[03:55.00]But that's not the shape of my heart
[04:01.00]But that's not the shape of my heart
[04:07.00]Thats not the shape,shape of my heart
