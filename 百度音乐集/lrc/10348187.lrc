[00:00.50]Josh Wilson â€“ I Refuse
[00:01.00]
[00:12.33]Sometimes I,
[00:15.02]I just want to close my eyes
[00:18.68]And act like everyone's alright
[00:22.72]When I know they're not.
[00:27.01]This world needs God
[00:29.69]But it's easier to stand and watch.
[00:33.31]I could say a prayer and just move on
[00:37.87]Like nothing's wrong.
[00:40.88]
[00:42.05]But I refuse.
[00:44.94]
[00:45.55]'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care.
[00:49.62]I don't want to say another empty prayer.
[00:53.11]Oh, I refuse to
[00:57.14]Sit around and wait for someone else
[01:00.68]To do what God has called me to do myself.
[01:04.23]Oh, I could choose
[01:08.49]Not to move but I refuse.
[01:14.41]
[01:22.79]I can hear the least of these
[01:26.26]Crying out so desperately,
[01:29.59]And I know we are the hands and feet
[01:33.75]Of you, oh god.
[01:37.78]So, if you say move,
[01:41.09]Then it's time for me to follow through,
[01:44.80]And do what I was made to do.
[01:49.67]Show them who you are.
[01:51.76]
[01:53.43]'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care.
[01:57.06]I don't want to say another empty prayer.
[02:00.39]
[02:01.25]Oh, I refuse to
[02:04.41]Sit around and wait for someone else
[02:08.26]To do what God has called me to do myself.
[02:11.78]Oh, I could choose
[02:15.93]Not to move but I refuse.
[02:20.11]
[02:21.48]To stand and watch
[02:23.14]The weary and lost
[02:24.93]Cry out for help.
[02:26.64]I refuse
[02:28.32]To turn my back
[02:30.51]And try and act like all is well.
[02:34.29]I refuse
[02:36.11]To stay unchanged,
[02:38.11]To wait another day,
[02:39.97]To die to myself.
[02:41.59]I refuse
[02:43.42]To make one more excuse.
[02:46.66]
[02:49.53]'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care.
[02:53.58]I don't want to say another empty prayer.
[02:56.87]Oh, I refuse to
[03:00.71]Sit around and wait for someone else
[03:04.56]To do what God has called me to do myself.
[03:07.97]Oh, I could choose
[03:12.21]Not to move but I refuse.
[03:17.75]
[03:23.01] I refuse
[03:19.43] I refuse
