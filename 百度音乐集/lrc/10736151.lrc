[00:04.45]Whitney Houston
[00:06.82]
[00:11.98]hu...
[00:24.07]I used to cry myself to sleep at night
[00:29.93]But that was all before he came
[00:36.84]I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
[00:42.40]But now he’s here
[00:45.55]It’s not the same, it’s not the same
[00:52.76]
[00:54.41]He fills me up
[00:57.53]He gives me love
[01:01.92]More love than I’ve ever seen
[01:06.98]He’s all I’ve got,
[01:09.88]He’s all I’ve got in this world
[01:14.09]But he’s all the man that I need
[01:22.28]
[01:24.52]And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
[01:30.22]He takes me down and rocks me slow
[01:37.23]And in the evening when the moon is high
[01:42.83]He holds me close and won’t let go
[01:49.19]He won’t let go
[01:54.05]
[01:54.80]He fills me up
[01:57.86]He gives me love
[02:02.31]More love than I’ve ever seen
[02:07.47]He’s all I’ve got,
[02:10.17]He’s all I’ve got in this world
[02:14.48]But he’s all the man that I need
[02:21.34]
[02:48.97]He fills me up
[02:51.98]He gives me love
[02:56.43]More love than I’ve ever seen
[03:01.59]He’s all I’ve got,
[03:04.78]He’s all I’ve got in this world
[03:08.54]But he’s all the man that I need
[03:13.80]He fills me up
[03:17.41]He gives me love
[03:20.56]More love than I’ve ever seen
[03:27.26]He’s all I’ve got,
[03:30.17]He’s all I’ve got in this world
[03:33.97]But he’s all the man that I need
[03:42.23]
