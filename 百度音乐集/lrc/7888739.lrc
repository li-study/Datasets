[00:00.00]Prelude
[00:10.16]
[03:09.10][00:13.10]Dream in your heart
[03:14.74][00:18.67]I feel in asleep night
[00:23.98]But there is only stars
[00:29.35]Like tears of the moon
[00:32.01]Like silent moon
[00:35.00]And on and on
[00:39.93]So the sad will fall and fall
[00:45.31]But I think all the dream
[00:50.49]Is true anyday, for anyone
[00:56.59]
[03:20.05][02:05.34]Love in your eyes
[03:25.31][02:10.73]I feel in clear sky
[02:16.11]But there is only winds
[02:20.81]Like sighs of the earth
[02:23.99]Like weeping earth
[02:26.73]Still on and on
[02:31.82]So the pain will blow and blow
[02:37.23]But I wish all the love
[02:41.96]Is free anyday, for anyone
[03:30.65][02:48.87]
