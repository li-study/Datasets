[00:03.00]
[00:07.26]Could call it a dream, well you are my dream girl
[00:11.11]Since you first came around and talked to me.
[00:14.34]But my words got choked up, wish I would've spoke up
[00:17.87]But now you and me are only make believe.
[02:10.10][01:54.07][01:04.85][00:21.78]Because I'm tongue tied.
[02:11.90][01:56.37][01:06.78][00:23.75]I can't find the words to say that I-I need you by my side.
[00:28.93]But I'm terrified just to talk to you.
[02:21.63][02:06.12][01:16.55][00:33.85]I won't be satisfied 'til I'm tongue tied with you.
[00:44.77]So now it's a new day, better get outta my way
[00:48.80]Gotta make you understand my master plan.
[00:51.80]I'm gonna practice my words, all my nouns and verbs
[00:55.21]Anything I could do to get through to you.
[00:58.56]I'm gonna make you mine,
[01:00.25]No matter rain or shine
[01:02.01]I just need some time.
[02:16.96][02:01.29][01:11.77]But I'm terrified just to talk to you
[01:34.30]Knees weak, can't speak
[01:36.38]I'm just stu-stuck on repeat.
[01:39.26]I'm thinking 'bout her 8 days a weeks it's not enough for me.
