[00:45.80]Standing in the darkness
[00:47.83]Waiting for the light
[00:50.45]The smell of pure adrenaline
[00:52.86]Burning in the night
[00:54.63]
[00:55.40]Random blinding flashes
[00:57.83]Aiming at the stage
[01:00.30]Intro tape begins to roll
[01:04.03]Igniting sonic rage
[01:05.58]
[01:06.32]Still they keep me between these hollow walls
[01:11.21]Hoping to find in me
[01:13.14]The answers to the test that stumped them all
[01:17.06]
[01:26.14]"The boy is simply crazy
[01:27.75]Suffering from delusions
[01:29.57]We honestly think that maybe
[01:31.48]He might need an institution
[01:32.87]
[01:33.29]He lives in a world of fiction
[01:35.25]And really could use some help
[01:37.09]We have just the place to fix him
[01:38.81]To save him from himself"
[01:41.52]
[01:51.01]Curled up in the darkness
[01:53.23]Searching for the light
[01:55.39]The smell of stale sweat and shit
[01:58.05]Streaming through the night
[01:59.81]
[02:00.44]Random urine testing
[02:02.79]Pills red, pink and blue
[02:05.44]Counseling and therapy
[02:09.20]Providing not a clue
[02:10.87]
[02:11.48]Still they keep me between these hollow walls
[02:16.42]Hoping to find in me
[02:18.27]The answers to the test that stumped them all
[02:22.19]
[02:31.31]"We can't seem to find the answers
[02:32.93]He seemed such a clear cut case
[02:34.66]We cannot just let him leave here
[02:36.61]And put all this work to waste
[02:38.32]
[02:38.56]Why don't we try shock treatment
[02:40.37]It really might do some help
[02:42.04]We have just the tools to fix him
[02:44.05]To save him from himself"
