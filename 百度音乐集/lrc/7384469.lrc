[00:02.00]Better Than Revenge
[00:05.80]Taylor Swift 
[00:08.37]
[00:18.05]The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
[00:21.42]I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him.
[00:24.58]She came a long got him alone and let's hear the applause.
[00:27.95]She took him faster than you could say sabotage.
[00:31.04]
[00:31.31]I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it.
[00:34.51]I underestimated just who I was dealing with.
[00:37.85]She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum.
[00:41.16]She underestimated just who she was stealing from.
[00:44.20]
[00:45.71]She's not a saint and she's not what you think.
[00:48.67]She's an actress. Woah.
[00:52.06]She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress. Woah.
[00:58.87]Soon she's gonna find stealing other peoples toys 
[01:01.88]On the playground won't make you many friends.
[01:05.50]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
[01:08.01]There is nothing I do better than revenge.
[01:11.45]
[01:18.93]She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list.
[01:22.27]She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it.
[01:25.50]I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
[01:28.79]She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things. 
[01:31.78]
[01:32.15]But, sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know.
[01:35.27]Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go.
[01:38.72]They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me.
[01:42.13]And no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity. 
[01:45.09]
[01:46.52]She's not a saint and she's not what you think.
[01:49.59]She's an actress. Woah.
[01:53.10]She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress. Woah.
[01:59.71]Soon she's gonna find stealing other peoples toys 
[02:02.98]On the playground won't make you many friends.
[02:06.29]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
[02:08.83]There is nothing I do better than revenge.
[02:12.16]
[02:16.12]I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey.
[02:19.42]You might have him but have't you heard.
[02:22.73]I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey.
[02:25.90]You might have him but I always get the last word. 
[02:32.56]Woahhhhh

[03:02.35]She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
[03:04.76]There is nothing I do better than revenge.
[03:08.12]
[03:08.46]Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
[03:11.88]'Cause I don't think you do, oh
[03:15.11]Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
[03:18.49]I don't think you do. I don't think you do.
