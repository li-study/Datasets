[00:04.43]Olivia Ong
[00:06.04]
[00:13.19]I love you I love you I love you I do
[00:25.51]I love you I love you I love you I do
[00:38.18]I love you I love you I love you I do
[00:53.25]I love you I love you I love you I do
[01:04.84]I love you I love you I love you I do
[01:17.32]
[01:34.26]I can see the colours in your eyes
[01:37.29]My feelings arise
[01:41.45]And the mirror catches on to what
[01:44.48]We feel deep inside
[01:49.25]Playing off the colours in your eyes
[01:52.32]Underneath the starry skies
[01:56.70]I don`t have to ever make believe
[01:59.79]As the gaze turns wide and bright
[02:03.20]
[02:04.25]Baby the smile you see
[02:07.74]It`s everything I want it to be
[02:11.30]I know just how I feel
[02:15.03]This is how it should always be
[02:17.46]
[02:33.57]You have always been a nice surprise
[02:36.54]Of sorts for me
[02:41.00]Baby baby you make me believe
[02:43.98]In all my dreams
[02:48.27]You don`t ever have to second guess
[02:51.44]Right now I do confess
[02:55.67]When I think of love I think of you
[02:58.80]Now you know I want you too
[03:02.20]
[03:03.00]Baby the smile you see
[03:06.54]It`s everything I want it to be
[03:10.27]I know just how I feel
[03:14.12]This is how it should always be
[03:16.63]
[03:18.40]Baby the smile you see
[03:21.45]It`s everything I want it to be
[03:25.35]I know just how I feel
[03:28.84]This is how it should always be
[03:31.31]
[03:36.21]I`m falling into the stars
[03:43.45]I catch me a shooting star
[03:50.81]And I place it near my heart
[03:58.45]This love won`t come apart
[04:01.35]
[04:01.82]I love you I love you I love you I do
[04:09.17]I love you I love you
[04:17.04]Baby the smile you see
[04:20.63]It`s everything I want it to be
[04:23.95]I know just how I feel
[04:27.83]This is how it should always be
[04:30.44]
[04:31.79]Baby the smile you see
[04:35.39]It`s everything I want it to be
[04:39.55]I know just how I feel
[04:42.61]This is how it should always be
[04:46.59]
