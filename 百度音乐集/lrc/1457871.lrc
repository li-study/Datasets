[00:10.04]Stay for just a while
[00:13.87]Stay, and let me look at you
[00:17.61]It's been so long, I hardly knew you
[00:21.55]Standing in the door
[00:25.41]Stay with me a while
[00:29.44]I only want to talk to you
[00:33.02]We're traveled halfway 'round the world
[00:36.60]To find ourselves again
[00:39.80]
[00:41.40]September morn
[00:46.01]We danced until the night became a brand new day
[00:52.75]Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
[00:59.98]September morning still can make me feel this way
[01:06.22]
[01:09.22]Look at what you're done
[01:12.93]Why, you're become a grown-up girl
[01:16.51]I still can hear you crying
[01:19.51]In the corner of your room
[01:23.93]And look how far we're come
[01:27.00]So far from where we used to be
[01:31.47]But not so far that we're forgotten
[01:35.28]How it was before
[01:38.23]
[01:39.79]September morn
[01:43.91]Do you remember how we danced that night away
[01:51.07]Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
[01:58.09]September morning still can make me feel this way
