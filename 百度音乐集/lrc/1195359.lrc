[00:01.94]Behind the Clouds
[00:06.55]Brad Paisley
[00:15.31]When you're feeling lonely, lost and let down
[00:22.78]Seems like those dark skies are following you around
[00:31.67]And life's just one big shade of gray
[00:38.95]You wonder if you'll see the light of day
[00:45.60]
[00:45.62]Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
[00:52.95]Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
[01:00.79]You may not see the silver lining
[01:08.15]But there's a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds
[01:16.62]
[01:46.46]I've heard it said that this too shall pass
[01:53.64]Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
[02:02.06]But thinking that your luck won't ever change
[02:09.63]Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain
[02:16.60]
[02:16.62]Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
[02:24.64]Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
[02:31.49]You may not see the silver lining
[02:39.24]But there's a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds
[02:46.51]Yeah, there's a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds
[02:55.15]
