[00:10.68]They say love keeps on growing
[00:14.56]There still one thing thay I've felt I've always known
[00:22.91]Cause it wouldn't matter where you're going
[00:27.18]Cause where you are is where I wanna go
[00:32.82]
[00:35.00]I know why the heart gets lonely
[00:41.39]Everytime a rock gets rolled away
[00:48.04]And if you think that you are only
[00:53.63]Shadows in the wind
[00:56.81]Rolling 'round but when you go
[00:59.35]and let somebody in they might fade away
[01:06.83]
[01:10.95]Tell me why the road keeps turning
[01:15.97]When everything you want is straight ahead
[01:22.50]And every thing I thought worth learning
[01:28.49]Is forgotten when I see your face instead
[01:33.74]
[01:35.99]I know why the heart gets lonely
[01:41.54]Every time you give your life away
[01:48.06]And if you think that you are only
[01:53.86]Shadows in the wind
[01:56.81]Rolling â€˜round but when you go
[01:59.88]and let somebody in they might fade away
[02:06.02]
[02:06.17]All you say is so overrated
[02:12.95]Holding on to yesterday
[02:18.76]Along the way, it can get too complicated to say
[02:30.73]
[03:26.86][03:00.74]I know why the heart gets lonely
[03:32.64][03:06.46]Every time you give your life away
[03:39.24][03:13.79]And if you think that you are only
[03:44.99][03:19.59]Shadows in the wind,
[03:22.64]You'd better think it again
[03:46.90]Rolling 'round but when you go
[03:50.31]and let somebody in they might fade away
[03:56.98]
[03:58.89]Fade away
[04:02.38]
