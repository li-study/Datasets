[00:17.50]I believe the children are our future
[00:22.00]Teach them well and let them lead the way
[00:25.50]Show them all the beauty they possess inside
[00:31.00]Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
[00:38.00]Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
[00:47.50]Everybody's searching for a hero
[00:51.50]People need someone to look up to
[00:55.00]I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
[01:00.50]A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me
[01:09.50]I decided long ago
[01:13.00]Never to walk in anyone's shadows
[01:17.00]If I fail  If I succeed
[01:20.00]At least I lived as I believed
[01:24.00]No matter what they take from me
[01:27.50]They can't take away my dignity
[01:31.50]Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
[01:45.50]I've found the greatest love of all inside of me
[01:56.50]The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
[02:11.00]Learning to love yourself  it is the greatest love of all
[02:22.50]
[02:24.50]I believe the children are our future
[02:28.50]Teach them well and let them lead the way
[02:32.00]Show them all the beauty they possess inside
[02:38.00]Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
[02:45.00]Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
[02:54.00]I decided long ago
[02:57.50]Never to walk in anyone's shadows
[03:01.50]If I fail  If I succeed
[03:04.50]At least I lived as I believed
[03:08.00]No matter what they take from me
[03:12.00]They can't take away my dignity
[03:16.00]Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
[03:30.00]I've found the greatest love of all inside of me
[03:41.00]The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
[03:55.50]Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
[04:07.00]And if by chance that special place
[04:14.50]That you've been dreaming of
[04:22.00]Leads you to a lonely place
[04:27.50]Find your strength in love
