[00:13.07]I left my street I'm a guillotine
[00:18.49]Pulling away In my machine,
[00:22.78]Where have I been, now?
[00:25.32]Not you
[00:31.62]Shooting stars in my left arm An alcohol low
[00:36.96]Giving away time to Casio Sun is slow
[00:44.15]I got soul
[00:49.27]Is this where I'm going to
[00:54.57]We'll see
[00:59.17]We'll see
[01:01.35]We'll see
[01:03.73]I kill this sleep I'm the man in the moon
[01:08.39]Walking on sand on my home high noon
[01:12.81]In love with the moon
[01:15.48]love you
[01:22.52]Cos I lift my Street I'm a guillotine
[01:27.68]Pull it away In my machine
[01:32.48]Forget where I've been before
[01:34.35]Forget you
[01:39.60]Is this where I'm going to
[01:44.45]We'll see
[01:48.92]We'll see
[01:51.61]We'll see
