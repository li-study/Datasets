[00:00.79]Tired Of Being Sorry
[00:02.88]Enrique Iglesias
[00:05.01]
[00:16.81]I don't know why
[00:20.01]You want to follow me tonight
[00:23.93]When in the rest of the world
[00:27.38]With you whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
[00:32.38]Let's me down so
[00:35.88]For a thousand reasons that I know
[00:39.89]To share forever the unrest
[00:43.89]With all the demons I possess
[00:47.89]Beneath the silver moon
[00:50.44]
[00:52.46]Maybe you were right
[00:56.48]But baby I was lonely
[01:00.48]I don't want to fight
[01:04.00]I'm tired of being sorry
[01:07.04]
[01:25.02]Chandler and Van Nuys
[01:28.59]With all the vampires and their brides
[01:31.99]We're all bloodless and blind
[01:35.85]And longing for a life
[01:39.69]Beyond the silver moon
[01:42.39]
[01:44.47]Maybe you were right
[01:48.31]But baby I was lonely
[01:52.36]I don't want to fight
[01:56.11]I'm tired of being sorry
[02:00.43]I'm standing in the street
[02:03.00]
[02:04.44]Crying out for you
[02:08.44]No one sees me
[02:12.26]But the silver moon
[02:15.48]
[02:33.22]So far away – so outer space
[02:37.39]I've trashed myself – I've lost my way
[02:41.40]I've got to get to you got to get to you
[02:43.67]
[02:48.94]Maybe you were right
[02:52.41]But baby I was lonely
[02:56.41]I don't want to fight
[03:00.34]I'm tired of being sorry
[03:04.64]I'm standing in the street
[03:08.37]Crying out for you
[03:12.47]No one sees me
[03:16.38]But the silver moon
[03:20.86](lalalala till end)
[03:21.69]Maybe you were right
[03:24.41]But baby I was lonely
[03:28.45]I don't want to fight
[03:32.43]I'm tired of being sorry
[03:36.50]I'm standing in the street
[03:40.36]Crying out for you
[03:44.43]No one sees me
[03:48.37]But the silver moon
[03:51.45]
