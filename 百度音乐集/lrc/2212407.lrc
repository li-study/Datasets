[00:01.12]Snow Patrol - The Lightning Strike
[00:08.10]
[04:06.14][01:13.10]What if this storm ends?
[04:08.75][01:16.43]And I don't see you
[04:11.79][01:19.37]As you are now
[04:14.64][01:22.32]Ever again
[04:16.36][01:24.37]
[04:17.83][01:25.44]The perfekt halo
[04:20.60][01:28.30]Of gold hair and lightning
[04:23.85][01:31.58]Sets you off against
[04:27.21][01:34.89]The planet's last dance
[04:29.41][01:37.11]
[04:30.03][01:37.74]Just for a minute
[04:33.15][01:40.85]The silver forked sky
[04:36.42][01:44.18]Lit you up like a star
[04:39.46][01:47.26]That I will follow
[04:41.68][01:49.38]
[04:42.57][01:50.37]Now it's found us
[04:45.63][01:53.34]Like I have found you
[04:48.51][01:56.44]I don't want to run
[04:51.75][01:59.43]Just overwhelm me
[04:59.08][02:01.47]
[02:27.64]What if this storm ends?
[02:30.37]And leaves us nothing
[02:33.36]Except a memory
[02:36.53]A distant echo
[02:38.38]
[02:39.34]I want pinned down
[02:42.64]I want unsettled
[02:45.76]Rattle cage after cage
[02:48.86]Until my blood boils
[02:50.92]
[02:52.03]I want to see you
[02:55.05]As you are now
[02:58.80]Every single day
[03:01.18]That I am living
[03:02.97]
[03:04.36]Painted in flames
[03:07.35]All peeling thunder
[03:10.32]Be the lightning in me
[03:13.38]That strikes relentless
[06:11.57]
[06:14.17]From here the caravans are kids toys
[06:20.45]And I can hold them all in my palm
[06:26.85]I watch the sea creep round the corner
[06:33.15]It connects the dots from here to you
[06:39.70]The sunlight burning through the loose flags
[06:46.51]Painted high on white church walls
[06:52.43]I chase my blood from brain to thumped heart
[06:58.82]Until I'm out of breath for trying
[07:04.05]
[07:06.45]Worry not everything is sound
[07:12.85]This is the safest place you've found
[07:19.24]The only noise beating out is ours
[07:25.69]Lacing our tea from honey jars
[07:29.97]
[07:43.90]These accidents of faith and nature
[07:50.21]They tend to stick in the spokes of you
[07:56.53]But every now and then the trend bucks
[08:03.25]And you're repaired by more than glue
[08:09.72]
[08:10.63]Worry not everything is sound
[08:16.90]This is the safest place you've found
[08:23.04]The only noise beating out is ours
[08:29.70]Lacing our tea from honey jars
[08:33.81]
[08:36.09]Why don't you rest your fragile bones
[08:42.47]A minute ago you looked alone
[08:48.38]Stop waving your arms you're safe and dry
[08:55.07]Breathe in and drink up the winter sky
[08:59.91]
[10:52.62]Slowly the day breaks apart in our hands
[11:07.06]And soft hallelujahs flow in from the church
[11:21.53]The one on the corner you said frightened you
[11:35.87]It was too dark and too large to find your soul in
[11:48.33]
[11:50.01]Something was bound to go right sometime today
[11:54.63]All these broken pieces fit together to make a perfect picture of us
[12:05.04]It got cold and then dark so suddenly and rained
[12:09.15]It rained so hard the two of us were the only thing
[12:14.35]That we could see for miles and miles
[12:18.96]
[12:19.58]And in the middle of the flood I felt my worth
[12:23.33]When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
[12:29.02]Please know that you were mine as well
[12:34.07]Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
[12:38.13]And spread out into shapes like
[12:41.88]Salad bowls and basins and buckets for bailing out the flood
[12:47.60]
[12:48.88]As motionless cars rust on driveways and curbs
[13:03.39]You take off your raincoat and stretch out your arms
[13:17.94]We both laugh out loud and surrender to it
[13:32.40]The sheer force of sky and the cold magnet Earth
[13:44.71]
[13:46.36]Something was bound to go right sometime today
[13:51.04]All these broken pieces fit together to make a perfect picture of us
[14:01.41]It got cold and then dark so suddenly and rained
[14:05.50]It rained so hard the two of us were the only thing
[14:10.57]That we could see for miles and miles
[14:15.52]
[14:15.86]And in the middle of the flood I felt my worth
[14:19.70]When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
[14:25.32]Please know that you were mine as well
[14:30.50]Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
[14:34.50]And spread out into shapes like
[14:37.38]Salad bowls and basins and buckets for bailing out the flood
[15:04.56]
