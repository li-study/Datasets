[00:08][00:02]Everytime I,
[00:09][00:04]Close my eyes (2x)
[00:12]Listen girl,
[00:14]I don't know where to start
[00:17]But every word I say,
[00:19]Straight from the heart
[00:23]I've been so wrong
[00:25]Never meant to hurt you
[00:28]Oh girl, I'm sorry
[00:30]Of what I put you through
[00:33]Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
[00:37](One more chance)
[00:38]I want you back again
[00:41](Want you back again)
[02:51][01:37][00:43]'Cuz everytime I close my eyes
[02:55][01:40][00:46]I see your face
[02:56][01:41][00:47]And I wonder
[02:57][01:42][00:48]When you close your eyes
[03:00][01:45][00:52]Do you really think about me
[03:02][01:48][00:54]Now that I realize,
[03:05][01:50][00:57]I want you girl, and no other
[03:07][01:53][00:59]Everytime I close my eyes
[03:11][01:56][01:03], you're all that I see
[01:06]You and I shared it all together
[01:11]Each other, with all we'd ever need (All we ever need)
[01:16]I thought that you would stay,
[01:19]With me forever
[01:21]But it took for granted
[01:24]The love you gave to me
[01:27]I keep on trying, keep on trying
[01:29]until the end, until the end
[01:32]Baby I need you right here with me
[01:34]I need you here
[02:00]Girl I'm going out of my mind
[02:04]I miss you so much,
[02:06]I don't know what to do (what to do)
[02:10]Please stay
[02:11]It's just a matter of time
[02:15]Until I feel your touch
[02:17]Until you let me come back to you
[02:21]I think about you girl,
[02:22]Every day and night I'm in love
[02:24]And it feels so right, I'd never meant to hurt you
[02:26]Or caused you pain
[02:28]I was just callin' up
[02:29]In that lying game
[02:31]But now those days are over
[02:32]I've changed our ways
[02:33]And now I'm counting the minutes,
[02:35]I'm counting the days
[02:36]Until you let me come back
[02:37]Till you let me start
[02:38]To find a new way
[02:40]To get back into your heart
[02:42]Girl I'd do anything for one more chance (one more chance)
[02:47]'Cuz I want you, I want you back again
[03:35][03:28][03:13]Everytime I close my eyes
[03:16](Oh, I can see)
