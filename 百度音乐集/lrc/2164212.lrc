[00:14.25]I like the way your sparkling earrings lay,
[00:21.07]against your skin, it's so brown
[00:28.06]and I wanna sleep with youin the desert tonight
[00:34.54]with a billion stars all around
[00:39.82]'cause I gotta peaceful easy feeling
[03:21.27][01:40.06][00:47.66]and I know you won't let me down
[03:27.48][01:46.31][00:53.78]'cause I'm already standing on the ground
[01:07.39]And I found out a long time ago
[01:13.55]what a woman can do to your soul
[01:20.64]Ah, but she can't take you anyway
[01:26.85]You don't already know how to go
[01:32.50]and I gotta peaceful, easy feeling
[02:47.29]I get this feeling I may know you
[02:54.37]as a lover and a friend
[03:00.95]but this voice keeps whispering in my other ear,
[03:06.57]tells me I may never see you again
[03:13.44]'cause I get a peaceful, easy feeling
[03:33.91]'cause I'm already standing...
[03:47.60]On the ground
[03:54.27]oooo, oooo
