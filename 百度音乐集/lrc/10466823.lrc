[00:01.12]Monty Are I - Mirage
[00:05.89]
[00:11.21]Awoke in heat, it's unbearable
[00:16.19]But I climb the hill
[00:19.68]And the sands are burning
[00:25.00]They're bending circuits in sand castles
[00:30.09]Stealing minerals
[00:33.33]So the world keeps turning
[00:38.04]
[00:38.31]They take and they take 'til it's gone
[00:44.88]When metal meets sand, something's wrong
[00:51.25]But they won't get caught
[00:55.06]Because I forgot, it's a mirage
[01:01.08]It's a mirage, it's a mirage
[01:07.13]
[01:07.59]Blistering feet, it's a miracle
[01:11.88]They survived at all
[01:15.30]When they keep returning
[01:20.84]They're chasing riches and changing rules
[01:25.88]And we've all been fooled
[01:29.27]The machine keeps learning
[01:33.67]
[01:33.97]They take and they take 'til it's gone
[01:40.52]When metal meets sand, something's wrong
[01:46.94]But they won't get caught
[01:50.26]Because I forgot, it's a mirage
[01:56.72]It's a mirage, it's a mirage
[02:03.68]It's a mirage, it's a mirage
[02:16.27]
