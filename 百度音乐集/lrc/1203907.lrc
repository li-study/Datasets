[00:05.00]Title: Tangled Up In Blue
[00:10.00]Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
[00:12.12]I was layin' in bed
[00:15.00]Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
[00:17.50]If her hair was still red.
[00:20.00]Her folks they said our lives together
[00:22.75]Sure was gonna be rough
[00:24.79]They never did like mama's homemade dress
[00:27.00]Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
[00:30.05]And i was standin' on the side of the road
[00:32.38]Rain fallin' on my shoes
[00:35.02]Heading out for the east coast
[00:37.25]Lord knows i've paid some dues gettin' through,
[00:42.28]Tangled up in blue.
[00:53.51]She was married when we first met
[00:56.55]Soon to be divorced
[00:58.08]I helped her out of a jam, i guess,
[01:00.00]But i used a little too much force.
[01:03.00]We drove that car as far as we could
[01:05.88]Abandoned it out west
[01:08.71]Split up on a dark sad night
[01:10.00]Both agreeing it was best.
[01:12.77]She turned around to look at me
[01:15.00]As i was walkin' away
[01:18.00]I heard her say over my shoulder,
[01:19.75]We'll meet again some day on the avenue
[01:25.00]Tangled up in blue
[01:35.90]I had a job in the great north woods
[01:39.00]Working as a cook for a spell
[01:40.37]But i never did like it all that much
[01:43.00]And one day the ax just fell.
[01:46.03]So i drifted down to new orleans
[01:48.00]Where i was lucky just to be employed
[01:50.80]Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
[01:52.83]Right outside of delacroix.
[01:56.00]But all the while i was alone
[01:58.00]The past was close behind,
[01:59.85]I seen a lot of women
[02:02.25]But she never escaped my mind, and i just grew
[02:08.00]Tangled up in blue.
[02:19.00]She was workin' in a topless place
[02:21.00]And i stopped in for a beer,
[02:23.89]I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
[02:26.00]In the spotlight so clear.
[02:28.50]And later on as the crowd thinned out
[02:31.00]I's just about to do the same,
[02:33.52]She was standing there in back of my chair
[02:35.00]Said to me, don't i know your name? I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
[02:39.59]She studied the lines on my face.
[02:43.02]I must admit i felt a little uneasy
[02:44.85]When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
[02:50.08]Tangled up in blue.
[03:00.82]She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
[03:05.75]\i thought you'd never say hello,\ she said
[03:08.00]\you look like the silent type.\<br>Then she opened up a book of poems
[03:12.81]And handed it to me
[03:15.05]Written by an italian poet
[03:17.88]From the thirteenth century.
[03:19.41]And every one of them words rang true
[03:21.94]And glowed like burnin' coal
[03:24.48]Pourin' off of every page
[03:26.01]Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
[03:31.54]Tangled up in blue.
[03:42.57]I lived with them on montague street
[03:45.61]In a basement down the stairs,
[03:46.74]There was music in the cafes at night
[03:48.07]And revolution in the air.
[03:52.00]Then he started into dealing with slaves
[03:53.74]And something inside of him died.
[03:56.87]She had to sell everything she owned
[03:58.80]And froze up inside.
[04:01.33]And when finally the bottom fell out
[04:03.87]I became withdrawn,
[04:05.40]The only thing i knew how to do
[04:07.93]Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
[04:12.46]Tangled up in blue.
[04:23.25]So now i'm goin' back again,
[04:25.23]I got to get to her somehow.
[04:28.36]All the people we used to know
[04:30.00]They're an illusion to me now.
[04:32.73]Some are mathematicians
[04:35.35]Some are carpenter's wives.
[04:37.19]Don't know how it all got started,
[04:39.12]I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
[04:42.00]But me, i'm still on the road
[04:44.00]Headin' for another joint
[04:46.52]We always did feel the same,
[04:49.00]We just saw it from a different point of view,
[04:53.39]Tangled up in blue.
