[ti:The Last Unicorn]
[ar:America]

[00:12.89]
[00:17.46]When the last eagle flies
[00:22.06]Over the last crumbling mountain
[00:27.50]And the last lion roars
[00:32.39]At the last dusty fountain
[00:37.30]In the shadow of the forest
[00:42.42]Though she may be old and worn
[00:47.78]They will stare unbelieving
[00:52.38]At the Last Unicorn
[00:59.66]When the first breath of winter
[01:04.20]Throught the flowers is icing
[01:09.51]And you look to the north
[01:14.08]And a pale moon is rising
[01:19.31]And it seems like all is dying
[01:24.28]And would leave the world to mourn
[01:29.13]In the distance hear her laughter
[01:33.82]It's the Last Unicorn
[01:38.59]I'm alive....... I'm alive
[01:55.96]When the last moon is cast
[02:00.02]Over the last star of morning
[02:05.31]And the future has past
[02:09.57]Without even a last desparate warning
[02:15.18]Then look into the sky where through
[02:20.94]The cloudes a path is formed
[02:25.10]Look and see her how she sparkles
[02:29.29]It's the Last Unicorn
[02:34.44]I'm alive... I'm alive.
