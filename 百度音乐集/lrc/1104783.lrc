[00:10.31]There was a game we used to play
[00:13.10]We would hit the town on Friday night
[02:01.36][00:16.92]And stay in bed until Sunday
[00:20.12]We used to be so free
[00:22.61]We were living for the love we had and
[02:10.93][00:26.56]Living not for reality
[01:30.54][01:28.25][01:25.83][01:21.06][01:18.71][01:16.41][00:43.15][00:40.74][00:38.27][00:33.56][00:31.20][00:28.87]Just my imagination
[02:29.83][02:20.31][01:32.84][01:23.42][00:45.45][00:35.91]It was
[03:41.79][01:36.00][00:48.20]
[00:58.04]There was a time I used to pray
[01:00.76]I have always kept my faith in love
[01:04.55]It's the greatest thing from the man above
[01:07.88]The game I used to play
[01:10.23]I've always put my cards upon the table
[01:13.85]Let it never be said that I'd be unstable
[01:54.85]There is a game I like to play
[01:57.03]I like to hit the town on Friday night
[02:04.58]We'll always be this free
[02:07.13]We will be living for the love we have
[02:27.49][02:25.01][02:22.65][02:17.94][02:15.59][02:13.24]It's not my imagination
[02:41.98][02:32.22]Not my...
