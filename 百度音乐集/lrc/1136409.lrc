[00:-1.00]

[00:18.00]
[00:18.62]Okay,
[00:22.46]I woke up in heaven today
[00:28.56]She kissed me I floated away, away
[00:34.95]Never felt anything so great
[00:39.60]
[00:44.08]Alright,
[00:47.97]Now I brace myself for the fights
[01:00.78]I’m light as a feather tonight
[01:05.07]
[01:08.38]Cause I can’t feel the ground
[01:11.79]Someone let me down
[01:16.41]I never felt so high as I do now
[01:21.50]It's too good to be true
[01:24.57]I don’t deserve you
[01:29.16]I never felt a love strong enough to
[01:34.24]Stop this world from spinning
[01:40.75]Stop this world from spinning
[01:43.73]
[01:47.85]And I see,
[01:51.94]Heaven when she looks at me
[01:58.49]In her smile is the most amazing dream
[02:04.85]And in her eyes I fall asleep
[02:13.69]And I hope,
[02:17.94]Hope that she can see through the smoke
[02:24.09]Of my imperfections into my soul
[02:30.66]And my heart where she has control (she has control)
[02:38.23]
[02:38.58]Cause I can’t feel the ground
[02:41.51]Someone let me down
[02:46.12]I never felt so high as I do now
[02:50.94]Its too good to be true
[02:54.42]I don’t deserve you
[02:58.83]I never felt a love strong enough to
[03:03.69]Stop this world from spinning
[03:06.86]
[03:08.77]Happiness like this can never last (can never last)
[03:14.98]Turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past)
[03:26.41](going just as fast)
[03:29.47]
[03:29.95]And I can’t feel the ground
[03:32.70]Someone let me down
[03:37.08]I said I’ve never been so high as I am now
[03:42.18]Its too good to be true
[03:45.54]I don’t deserve you
[03:49.86]I never felt a love strong enough to
[03:55.00]Stop this world from spinning
[04:01.63]Stop this world from spinning
[04:05.47]
