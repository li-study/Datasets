[00:03.00]Lady Antebellum
[00:06.11]
[00:16.17]I run from hate
[00:24.66]I run from prejudice
[00:26.71]I run from pessimists
[00:29.36]But I run too late
[00:33.57]I run my life
[00:39.82]Or is it running me
[00:41.65]Run from my past
[00:43.60]I run too fast
[00:46.18]Or too slow it seems
[00:50.68]When lies become the truth
[00:56.97]
[00:59.14]That’s when I run to you
[01:07.94]This world keeps spinning faster
[01:12.44]Into a new disaster so I run to you
[01:17.77]I run to you baby
[01:20.94]And when it all starts coming undone
[01:25.09]Baby you’re the only one I run to
[01:31.95]I run to you
[01:33.62]
[01:40.99]We run on fumes
[01:48.84]Your life and mine
[01:50.67]Like the sands of time
[01:53.45]Slippin’ right on through
[01:58.06]And our love’s the only truth
[02:06.50]That’s why I run to you
[02:15.76]This world keeps spinning faster
[02:19.84]Into a new disaster so I run to you
[02:25.17]I run to you baby
[02:28.37]And when it all starts coming undone
[02:32.49]Baby you’re the only one I run to
[02:39.33]I run to you
[02:41.17]
[02:57.66]This world keeps spinning faster
[03:01.94]Into a new disaster so I run to you
[03:07.23]I run to you baby
[03:10.55]And when it all starts coming undone
[03:14.70]Baby you’re the only one I run to
[03:21.94]I run to you
[03:27.09]
[03:33.36]I run to you
[03:35.64]I run to you
[03:37.98]
