[00:14.16]I've been cheated by you and I think you know when
[00:21.04]So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
[00:27.94]Look at me now, will I ever learn?
[00:31.41]I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
[00:37.15]There's a fire within my soul
[00:41.03]Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
[00:44.61]One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
[00:48.90]
[00:49.27]Mamma mia, here I go again
[00:52.67]My my, how can I resist you?
[00:56.15]Mamma mia, does it show again?
[00:59.53]My my, just how much I've missed you
[01:03.23]Yes, I've been brokenhearted
[01:06.70]Blue since the day we parted
[01:10.18]Why, why did I ever let you go?
[01:13.63]Mamma mia, now I really know
[01:17.07]My my, I should not have let you go
[01:21.17]
[01:27.18]I was angry and sad when I knew we were through
[01:34.13]I can't count all the times I have cried over you
[01:41.30]Look at me now, will I ever love?
[01:44.48]I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
[01:50.16]There's a fire within my soul
[01:54.02]Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
[01:57.55]One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
[02:01.98]
[02:02.32]Mamma mia, here I go again
[02:05.71]My my, how can I resist you?
[02:09.25]Mamma mia, does it show again?
[02:12.57]My my, just how much I've missed you
[02:16.30]Yes, I've been brokenhearted
[02:19.73]Blue since the day we parted
[02:23.11]Why, why did I ever let you go?
[02:26.22]
[02:26.54]Mamma mia, here I go again
[02:30.21]My my, how can I resist you?
