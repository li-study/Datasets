[00:16.56]
[00:18.31]Look out of any window, any morning, any evening, any day.
[00:30.86]Maybe the sun is shining, birds are winging,
[00:37.34]No rain is falling from a heavy sky.
[00:44.91]What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
[00:54.66]For this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.
[01:01.14]
[01:05.27]Walk out of any doorway, feel your way, feel your way like the day before.
[01:17.32]Maybe you'll find direction,
[01:22.11]Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you.
[01:29.52]What do you want me to do, to watch for you while you are sleeping?
[01:39.58]Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too.
[01:51.03]
[02:29.85]Look into any eyes you find by you, you can see clear to another day,
[02:41.40]Maybe been seen before, through other eyes on other days while going home.
[02:53.96]What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
[03:05.87]It's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.
[03:15.69]
[03:17.78]Walk into splintered sunlight,
[03:20.21]Inch your way through dead dreams to another land.
[03:25.98]Maybe you're tired and broken,
[03:32.30]Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear
[03:36.28]
[03:39.72]What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
[03:44.46]A box of rain will ease the pain, and love will see you through.
[03:56.56]
[04:01.17]Just a box of rain, wind and water,
[04:08.81]Believe it if you need it, if you don't just pass it on.
[04:17.57]Sun and shower, wind and rain,
[04:25.44]In and out the window like a moth before a flame.
[04:33.49]
[04:38.05]And it's just a box of rain, I don't know who put it there,
[04:44.51]Believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare.
[04:51.27]
[04:54.21]And it's just a box of rain, or a ribbon for your hair;
[05:02.60]Such a long long time to be gone, and a short time to be there.
