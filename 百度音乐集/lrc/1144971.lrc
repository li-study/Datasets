[00:16.50]I'm on a mission
[00:17.50]I made my decision
[00:19.50]To lead a path of self distruction
[00:23.50]A slow progression
[00:24.50]Killing my complexion
[00:26.50]And it's rotting out of my teeth
[00:30.50]I'm on a roll
[00:32.50]With no self control
[00:34.50]I'm blowing myself with
[00:36.50]Methamphetamine
[00:37.50]Don't know what I want
[00:39.50]That's all that I've got
[00:41.50]And I'm picking scabs off my face
[00:49.50]Every hour
[00:50.50]My blood is turning sour
[00:52.50]And my pulse is beating out of time
[00:56.50]I found a treasure
[00:57.50]Filled with sick pleasure
[00:59.50]And it sits on a thick white line
[01:03.50]I'm on a roll
[01:05.50]With no self control
[01:07.50]I'm blowing myself with
[01:08.50]Methamphetamine
[01:10.50]Don't know what I want
[01:12.50]That's all that I've got
[01:14.50]And I'm picking scabs off my face
[01:32.50]I'm on a mission
[01:34.50]I got no decision
[01:35.50]Like a cripple running the rat race
[01:40.50]Wish in one hand
[01:41.50]And shit in the other
[01:43.50]And see which one gets filled first
[01:46.50]I'm on a roll
[01:49.50]With no self control
[01:50.50]I'm blowing myself with
[01:52.50]Methamphetamine
[01:54.50]Don't know what I want
[01:55.50]That's all that I've got
[01:57.50]And I'm picking scabs off my face
[02:09.50]Geek,
