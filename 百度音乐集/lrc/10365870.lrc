[00:09.37]You make me feel funny
[00:12.78]When you come around
[00:13.79]Yeah that's what I found out honey
[00:17.42]What am I doing without you
[00:19.13]You make me feel happy
[00:22.45]When I leave you behind
[00:23.82]It plays on my mind now honey
[00:27.21]What am I doing without you
[00:30.00]Took for granted everything we had
[00:33.87]As if I'd find someone
[00:36.57]Who's just like you
[00:39.95]We got a little world of our own
[00:42.41]I'll tell you things that no one else knows
[00:44.93]I let you in where no-one else goes
[00:48.26]What am I doing without you
[00:49.84]And all of the things I've been looking for
[00:52.30]Have always been here outside of my door
[00:54.76]And all of the time I'm looking for something new
[01:03.18][00:57.90]What am I doing without you
[03:15.79][03:05.88][02:56.03][02:46.34][01:59.14][01:04.81][00:59.81]
[01:08.91]Well I guess I'm ready
[01:11.94]For settling down
[01:13.17]And fooling around is over
[01:16.64]And I swear that it's true
[01:18.50]No buts or maybes
[01:21.85]When I'm falling down
[01:23.19]There's always someone who saves me
[01:26.22]And girl it's you
[01:29.37]Funny how life can be so surprising
[01:33.57]I'm just realising what you do
[01:39.28]We got a little world of our own
[01:41.80]I'll tell you things that no one else knows
[01:44.30]I let you in where no-one else goes
[01:47.61]What am I doing without you
[01:49.29]And all of the things I've been looking for
[01:51.73]Have always been here outside of my door
[01:54.15]And all of the time I'm looking for something new
[01:57.59]What am I doing without you
[02:00.02]Well it's feeling right now
[02:02.55]So let's do it right now
[02:05.05]Praying that some how
[02:06.59]You will understand the way
[02:10.10]It's feeling right now baby somehow
[02:13.97]I won't let this slip away
[02:18.82][03:08.37][02:48.55][02:28.82]We got a little world of our own
[03:10.87][02:51.04][02:31.26][02:21.39]I'll tell you things that no one else knows
[03:13.31][02:53.50][02:33.73][02:23.86]I let you in where no-one else goes
[02:37.08][02:27.20]What am I doing without you
[03:18.25][02:58.50][02:38.63]And all of the things I've been looking for
[03:20.76][03:00.98][02:41.13]Have always been here outside of my door
[03:23.26][03:03.42][02:43.62]And all of the time I'm looking for something new
