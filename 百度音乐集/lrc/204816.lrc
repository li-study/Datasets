[00:00.29]演唱：林忆莲,齐豫,刘美君,杜丽莎
[00:00.39]
[00:00.89]I swear
[00:02.89]By the moon and the stars in the sky
[00:08.51]And I swear
[00:11.27]Like the shadow that's by your side
[00:16.38]
[00:21.83]I see the questions in your eyes
[00:27.33]I know what's weighing on your mind
[00:32.87]You can be sure I know my part
[00:39.36]Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
[00:46.95]You'll only cry those happy tears
[00:52.59]And though I make mistakes
[00:56.65]I'll never break your heart
[01:01.18]And I swear
[01:04.03]By the moon and the stars in the sky
[01:09.66]I'll be there
[01:12.71]I swear
[01:15.18]Like a shadow that's by your side
[01:20.76]I'll be there
[01:24.11]For better or worse
[01:26.96]Till death do us part
[01:29.71]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[01:34.79]And I swear, wo..
[01:44.33]
[01:48.37]I'll give you every thing I can
[01:53.84]I'll build your dreams with these two hands
[01:59.17]We'll hang some memories on the walls
[02:05.53]And when ( And when ) just the two of us are there
[02:12.67]You won't have to ask if I still care
[02:18.63]Cause as the time turns the page
[02:22.01]My love won't age at all
[02:27.45]And I swear
[02:30.02]By the moon and the stars in the sky
[02:35.51]I'll be there, I'll be there
[02:38.59]I swear
[02:41.01]Like the shadow that's by your side
[02:46.64]I'll be there, I'll be there
[02:50.12]For better or worse, till death do us part
[02:55.75]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[03:00.29]And I swear
[03:04.15]
[03:14.59]I swear
[03:16.88]By the moon and stars in the sky
[03:22.45]I'll be there, I'll be there
[03:25.51]I swear
[03:27.88]Like the shadow that's by your side
[03:33.43]I'll be there, I'll be there
[03:36.97]For better or worse
[03:39.99]Till death do us part
[03:42.43]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[03:47.40]And I swear, I swear, oh I swear
[04:01.11]
