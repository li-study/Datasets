[00:33.07]Treated me kind
[02:27.73][00:36.33]Sweet destiny
[00:39.91]Carried me through desperation
[00:44.88]To the one that was waiting for me
[00:48.79]It took so long
[00:51.96]Still I believed
[00:55.43]Somehow the one that I needed
[02:49.21][00:58.66]Would find me eventually
[03:00.12][02:53.21][01:51.09][01:44.17][01:02.63]I had a vision of love
[02:56.45][01:47.46][01:05.99]And it was all that you've given to me
[02:39.38][01:14.66]Prayed through the nights
[01:18.12]Felt so alone
[01:21.32]Suffered through alienation
[01:26.55]Carried the weight on my own
[01:30.20]Had to be strong
[01:32.99]So I believed
[01:37.01]And now I know I've succeeded
[01:40.57]In finding the place I conceived
[01:54.33]And it was all that you've given me
[01:57.89]I've realized a dream
[02:04.32]And I visualized
[02:07.14]The love that came to be
[02:11.23]Feel so alive
[02:13.80]I'm so thankful that I've received
[02:17.49]The answer that heaven has sent down to me
[02:23.52]You treated me kind
[02:32.32]And I'll be eternally grateful
[02:35.95]Holding you so close to me
[02:42.68]So faithfully
[02:46.46]Knowing the one that I needed
[03:03.42]And it was all that you turned out to be
