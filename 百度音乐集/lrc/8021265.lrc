[00:02.00]toya
[00:03.00]
[00:14.64]Just getting used to waking up everyday
[00:19.13]Not seeing your face
[00:21.49]I just began to stop setting your place
[00:25.18]And I stop longing for your warm embrace
[00:29.86]And it was God that made me able
[00:33.06]To finally sleep at night
[00:36.04]Though you're not by my side
[00:39.59]Finally I don't hardly cry
[00:43.64]See right when I start letting go
[00:47.27]Somebody wants to let me know
[00:50.87]Can they take your place
[00:54.01]No they can't fill your space
[00:57.29]No
[00:59.62]I tried to move on but you're not gone
[01:03.20]Cuz in my heart you still live on
[01:07.49]See now I know why
[01:09.77]I'll never love another for the rest of my life
[01:13.09]And why
[01:14.29]Now that you're gone I'm holdin' on
[01:17.55]And deep in my heart
[01:19.62]I wanna move on
[01:22.14]And now I know why
[01:23.98]I'll never love another for the rest of my life
[01:28.21]I finally put your cloths away
[01:30.63]You know the ones you wore the day
[01:34.04]That you were taken away from me
[01:37.87]I just began to stop wearing my ring
[01:42.27]And I finally stop playin' our song
[01:45.91]When I realizied I was dancin' alone and
[01:49.97]Finally God gave me strength
[01:53.21]To go on and breath again
[01:56.39]See right when I start letting go
