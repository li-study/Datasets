[00:02.89]Everytime I think I've had enough of you
[00:05.99]I take you back again
[00:08.12]Not because I need a friend
[00:10.23]Just because I can't pretend
[00:12.88]Like the others do
[00:14.92]You think you're really serious
[00:17.44]Clever and mysterious
[00:19.49]Talking like you're dangerous
[00:22.05]Talking like a fool
[00:24.18]Every day there's someone else
[00:26.34]Who wants to get with me
[00:28.13]I'm telling you
[00:29.46]If you know what's good for you
[00:31.69]Treat me like you used to do
[00:33.89]Love me like before
[00:36.23]'Cos all I can do is watch and wonder
[00:40.94]where the boy I know has gone
[03:07.90][00:45.00]You say that you want me, well it's
[03:10.53][00:49.11]Time to tell your friends where they belong
[03:16.70][02:38.69][00:54.77]You can find it in your heart
[03:48.33][03:38.55][03:19.50][02:41.55][00:57.36]Give a little love
[03:50.46][03:40.95][03:21.84][02:43.88][01:00.00]Have a little faith
[03:43.35][03:24.26][02:46.36][01:02.50]In the two of us
[03:26.29][02:48.36][01:04.64]You can find it in your soul
[03:29.02][02:51.15][01:07.52]Give a little love
[03:31.42][02:53.48][01:09.78]Have a little faith
[03:33.67][02:55.88][01:12.06]In the two of us
[01:14.05]'Cos all I can do is watch and wonder
[01:18.86]where the boy I know has gone
[01:23.22]Little boy I don't want anything to do with you
[01:27.28]Get on your knees
[01:28.66]I'm the one you have to please
[01:30.85]Not the ones you want to be
[01:33.30]I don't think you're cool
[01:35.69]'Cos soon you can only watch and wonder
[01:40.37]Where the girl you knew has gone
[01:48.53]everything you did to me was wrong
[01:54.47]You can find it in your heart
[01:57.62]Give a little love
[01:59.65]Have a little faith
[02:01.78]In the two of us
[02:04.26]You can find it in your soul
[02:06.86]Give a little love
[02:09.08]Have a little faith
[02:11.66]In the two of us
[02:58.06][02:13.04]Cos soon you can only watch and wonder
[03:02.71][02:17.47]Where the girl you knew has gone
[02:22.32]And do you really wanna lose a friend
[02:27.17]You gotta understand or it has to end
[02:31.81]Cos I don't wanna wait for you anymore
[02:36.42]Can't take it anymore
