[00:27.15]Work all the summer and all the fall
[00:33.79]Just trying to find my little Lenore
[00:39.62]But now she's gone, and I don't worry
[00:45.64]'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
[00:51.17]
[00:55.41]One summer day when she went away
[01:00.50]Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
[01:06.61]But now she's gone and I don't worry
[01:12.65]'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
[01:18.34]
[01:21.22]There was days when I didn't know your name
[01:27.16]Why should I worry and prayer in vain
[01:32.92]But now she's gone and I don't worry
[01:39.06]'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world, alright
[01:45.40]
[02:12.57]Going to the station, down in the yard
[02:19.29]Gonna get me a freight train,
[02:22.02]Incomprehensible got too hard
[02:24.93]Now she's gone and I don't worry
[02:30.43]Because I'm sitting on top of the world
[02:35.77]
[02:39.34]The lonesome days they have gone by
[02:44.60]Why should I beg now
[02:47.50]when she's saying goodbye?
[02:50.37]But now she's gone and I don't worry
[02:56.16]'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
