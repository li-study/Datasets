[00:08.88]I can see you turn away when I ask what for
[00:15.69]You say it isn't anything, but I'm not sure
[00:22.72]Something underneath the skin won't let you be
[00:29.51]And you try to keep it in, but I can see
[00:36.60]
[00:37.63]The woman before me must have been hard on you
[03:02.65][01:40.02][00:44.27]'Cause that hurt in your eyes, I never put you through
[03:24.16][03:10.09][01:47.76][00:51.67]Sometimes I think you must be talking to
[03:31.03][03:16.99][01:54.61][00:58.67]The woman before me and you
[01:03.75]
[01:04.67]Sometimes in an argument, it will show
[01:11.61]When you go a little farther than you meant to go
[01:18.50]I know you don't mean the things that you say
[01:25.44]I just wanna ease the pain that's in your way
[01:32.96]
[02:55.60][01:33.54]But the woman before me must have been hard on you
[01:59.81]
[02:01.93]If there are sorrows that bring back a tear
[02:08.76]Don't let them keep us apart
[02:15.70]You oughta know you've got nothing to fear
[02:22.82]Here in my heart
[02:26.44]
[02:26.84]'Cause you and I will never be like the past
[02:33.86]Whatever kind of memories that you have
[02:41.02]Nothing's gonna hurt me how, can't you see
[02:47.80]I already made it a vow that I can keep
[03:37.46]
[03:40.12]The End
