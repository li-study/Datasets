[01:00.43]i heard there was a secret chord
[01:03.34]that david played and it pleased the lord
[01:07.12]but you don't really care for music, do you
[01:12.17]well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
[01:17.45]the minor fall and the major lift
[01:20.91]the baffled king composing hallelujah
[01:27.57]hallelujah...
[01:49.55]well your faith was strong but you needed proof
[01:52.63]you saw her bathing on the roof
[01:55.91]her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
[02:01.46]she tied you to her kitchen chair
[02:06.46]she broke your throne and she cut your hair
[02:09.85]and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
[02:16.79]hallelujah...
[02:39.69]baby i've been here before
[02:42.24]i've seen this room and i've walked this floor
[02:45.50]i used to live alone before i knew you
[02:51.59]i've seen your flag on the marble arch
[02:56.51]but love is not a victory march
[02:59.81]it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[03:06.33]hallelujah...
[03:28.75]well there was a time when you let me know
[03:32.11]what's really going on below
[03:35.16]but now you never show that to me do you
[03:40.68]but remember when i moved in you
[03:45.92]and the holy dove was moving too
[03:48.97]and every breath we drew was hallelujah
[03:56.24]hallelujah...
[04:59.81]well, maybe there's a god above
[05:02.92]but all i've ever learned from love
[05:06.41]was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
[05:11.81]it's not a cry that you hear at night
[05:18.81]it's not somebody who's seen the light
[05:22.07]it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[05:29.07]hallelujah...
