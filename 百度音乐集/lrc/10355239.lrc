[00:09.64]Sleep All Day
[00:14.26]sung by Jason Mraz
[00:21.08]
[00:25.15]His after moan though cries oh no
[00:28.57]He's building up a shine but he take it slow
[00:33.51]And he knows it time to make a change here
[00:38.56]And time to get away
[00:43.20]And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons
[00:48.03]And time to end the pain
[00:52.89]But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
[01:02.75]Why don't we?
[01:03.92]Sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
[01:12.63]She said what would your mother think and how would your father  react oh lord
[01:18.83]Would he take it all back what they've done
[01:22.46]No way he said take it, take it and you said to make it with your own two  hands
[01:30.90]That was my old man and he said
[01:32.98]if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
[01:41.92]oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
[01:47.60]recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
[01:53.04]going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us
[02:01.52]and we knew it was time to take a chance here
[02:06.27]and time to compromise our lives for just a little awhile
[02:11.16]and it was time for all the wrong lonely, lonesome reasons
[02:16.45]but time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight
[02:21.69]and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
[02:30.47]Why don't we?
[02:31.98]Sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
[02:40.86]as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
[02:50.35]it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun
[02:54.10]to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the  lines
[03:00.32]then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read  about the dreams
[03:04.94]and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
[03:09.60]and they knew it was time, time to take a chance here
[03:16.02]time to compromise our little lives for just a little while
[03:20.13]and they knew it was time for all the wrong reasons
[03:24.04]as time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy
[03:30.67]and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
[03:39.45]Why don't we?
[03:40.54]Sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
[03:49.15]She said what would your mother think and how would your father  react oh lord
[03:55.82]Would he take it all back what they've done
[04:07.13]That was my old man and he said
[04:09.87]if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
