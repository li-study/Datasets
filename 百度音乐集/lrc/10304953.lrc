[00:06.10]
[00:08.92]Mine was a fool's heart
[00:11.22]That treated you so hard
[00:13.18]I built a wall between you and I
[00:17.32]Kept you on the outside
[00:19.52]Cause on the inside
[00:21.57]I couldn't surrender so we'd fight
[00:25.62]All these wars and battles fought
[00:29.30]The strongest heart could not survive
[00:33.33]We said goodbye
[00:35.65]I said as you leave
[00:37.80]"You're gonna be sorry"
[00:40.83]But look who's sorry now
[00:43.98]The light's gone out
[00:45.97]The bridge is down
[00:48.65]Oh, look who's sorry now
[00:52.13]For all the wall's I built around
[00:56.71]Should have waved the white flag
[00:58.71]Put an end to this fight
[01:00.77]Should have taken your hand
[01:02.86]When I had you in my sight
[01:05.33]Wanna take these barricades
[01:08.39]And tear them down
[01:11.80]Look who's sorry now
[01:15.87]Look who's sorry now
[01:18.80]
[01:22.96]Talking in a circle
[01:25.08]Tryna work out
[01:27.08]What can I say to you tonight
[01:31.06]I'm shoutin "I'm sorry"
[01:33.43]I want you to want me
[01:35.32]Or is it to late to make it right
[01:39.31]Cause all these wars and battles fought
[01:43.16]No wonder we could not survive
[01:47.44]I wish I'd said
[01:49.37]The three words instead
[01:51.21]Of telling you goodbye
[01:54.55]But look who's sorry now
[01:57.71]The light's gone out
[01:59.62]The bridge is down

[02:22.30]And tear them down
[02:25.48]Look who's sorry now
[02:28.52]We've gone our seperate ways
[02:31.33]I'm stuck here in the present I made
[02:34.87]All I wanna do now is escape
[02:39.31]From the fear of love
[02:41.73]That put me here
[02:45.86]But look who's sorry now
[02:49.18]The light's gone out
[02:51.19]The bridge is down ï¼ŒOh
[02:54.24]Look who's sorry now
[02:57.34]For all the wall's I built around
