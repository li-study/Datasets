[00:04.00]Madonna
[00:05.50]
[00:33.48]Take a bow, the night is over
[00:38.89]This masquerade is getting older
[00:45.49]Light are low, the curtains down
[00:51.04]There’s no one here
[00:55.80]
[00:57.48]Say your lines but do you feel them
[01:03.46]Do you mean what you say
[01:06.87]when there’s no one around
[01:10.94]Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
[01:21.74]I’ve always been in love with you
[01:27.70]I guess you’ve always known it’s true
[01:33.59]You took my love for granted, why oh why
[01:39.43]The show is over, say good-bye
[01:45.09]Say good-bye, say good-bye
[01:54.29]Make them laugh, it comes so easy
[02:00.32]When you get to the part
[02:03.87]Where you’re breaking my heart
[02:08.03]Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
[02:18.63]Wish you well, I cannot stay
[02:24.41]You deserve an award
[02:27.74]for the role that you played
[02:31.90]No more masquerade, you’re one lonely star
[02:40.58]
[02:42.52]I’ve always been in love with you
[02:48.54]I guess you’ve always known it’s true
[02:54.34]You took my love for granted, why oh why
[03:00.27]The show is over, say good-bye
[03:06.30]I’ve always been in love with you
[03:12.54]I guess you’ve always known it’s true
[03:18.33]You took my love for granted, why oh why
[03:24.28]The show is over, say good-bye
[03:29.95]Say good-bye, say good-bye
[03:39.16]All the world is a stage
[03:44.55]And everyone has their part
[03:50.60]But how was I to know which way the story’d go
[03:56.90]How was I to know you’d break
[04:01.89]You’d break my heart
[04:06.28]I’ve always been in love with you
[04:12.69]Guess you’ve always known
[04:15.33]You took my love for granted, why oh why
[04:21.24]The show is over, say good-bye
[04:27.29]I’ve always been in love with you
[04:33.27]I guess you’ve always known it’s true
[04:39.33]You took my love for granted, why oh why
[04:45.23]The show is over, say good-bye
[04:50.89]Say good-bye, say good-bye
[05:01.92]Say good-bye
