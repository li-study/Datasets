[00:05.65]It's Fine
[00:07.25]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
[00:10.24]It's alright
[00:11.45]
[00:12.32]Had a dream last night
[00:14.59]That the world stopped turning
[00:17.22]But your madness, it kept on
[00:22.19]Guess I wasn't too bright
[00:24.40]And I really wasn't learning
[00:27.34]Should have seen it all along
[00:31.48]
[00:32.85]All those sweet, sweet kisses and those sweet red roses
[00:37.81]They convinced me that it was you
[00:42.81]I made you exclusive
[00:45.09]Now it's so conclusive
[00:47.98]That you wasn't doing it too
[00:51.57]
[00:53.24]If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
[00:55.46]It would have been fine
[00:58.09]It would have been fine
[00:59.96]Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
[01:03.25]If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
[01:06.03]It would have been fine
[01:08.15]Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
[01:12.15]
[01:12.76]Something didn't feel right
[01:14.93]And I wish I knew it
[01:17.56]I just could not see your games
[01:22.43]I got respect for you
[01:24.95]And you put me through it
[01:27.63]Why would you bring me so much pain
[01:33.15]
[01:33.45]I would stil love for you,'cause I did adore you
[01:37.97]While my dogs would chew you out
[01:40.64]Tried to be so nice on those lonely nights
[01:46.41]But I should have figured you out
[01:52.08]
[01:53.69]If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
[01:55.77]It would have been fine
[01:58.35]It would have been fine
[01:59.41]Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
[02:01.99]
[02:02.35]I would have had a good time
[02:03.92]If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
[02:05.79]It would have been fine
[02:07.26]It would have been you baby
[02:08.62]Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
[02:13.01]
