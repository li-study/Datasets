[01:01.00]Reading my paper in Ray's cafe
[01:04.96]The old guy next to me is loud as day
[01:10.72]Rambled and Rambled while eating his pie
[01:15.09]He dropped his wallet, now it's mine uh huh
[01:18.50]Sorry old man but that's just the way that it is
[03:15.56][02:53.02][02:11.21][01:32.61]Won't help at all to worry about it.
[01:38.22]Picked up the wallet and slipped outside
[01:43.83]Walked around and walked around and walked around town
[01:48.60]I found my nerve and a good place to hide
[01:57.45]Only to find no cash inside, uh huh
[03:05.23][02:44.43][02:00.50]Oh well I guess that's just the way that it is
[02:29.24]I got thirsty so I went to a bar
[02:32.12]Met a lil darlin with the face of a star
[02:36.02]In the morning woke up to find
[02:39.98]She stole my car along with my heart uh huh.
[03:00.05]Wish she'd grimmer back my heart, uh huh
