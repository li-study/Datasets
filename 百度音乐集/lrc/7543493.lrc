[00:12]
[00:15]Twenty seconds on the back time
[00:20]I feel you on the run
[00:25]Never lived too long to make right
[00:30]I see you're doing fine
[00:34]And when I get that feeling
[00:37]I can no longer slide I can no longer run
[00:43]And when I get that feeling
[00:47]I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun
[03:34][03:14][02:54][02:15][01:54][00:53]Well, you can say what you want
[03:36][03:16][02:56][02:16][01:56][00:56]But it won't change my mind
[03:39][03:19][02:59][02:19][01:59][00:58]I'll feel the same about you
[03:44][03:24][03:04][02:24][02:04][01:04]And you can tell me your reasons
[03:47][03:26][03:06][02:26][02:06][01:06]But it won't change my feelings
[03:49][03:29][03:09][02:29][02:09][01:09]I'll feel the same about you
[01:15]What I am is what you want of me
[01:20]Now that I'm not there
[01:25]Took the tables away from you
[01:30]It's turned that I don't care
[01:34]And when I get that feeling
[01:37]I can no longer slide I can no longer run
[01:43]And when I get that feeling
[01:47]I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun
[02:35]I've said goodnight try to sleep tight
[02:40]Just dream of me
[02:44]Go close your eyes cause I'll close mine
[02:47]The sun will shine from time to time
[02:51]When you dream of me
