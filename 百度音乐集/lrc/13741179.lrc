[00:04.66]I've tried playing it cool
[00:08.65]Girl when I'm looking at you
[00:12.33]I can never be brave
[00:15.55]Cause you make my heart race
[00:19.69]Shot me out of the sky
[00:23.78]You're my kryptonite
[00:27.40]You keep me making me weak
[00:31.00]Yeah, frozen and can't breathe
[00:34.82]Some things gotta get loud
[00:38.02]Cause if not, they just don't make you see
[00:41.99]That I need you here with me now
[00:46.08]Cause you've got that one thing
[00:49.68]So get out, get out, get out of my head
[00:53.77]And fall into my arms instead
[00:57.58]I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
[01:01.40]But I need that one thing
[01:05.13]And you've got that one thing
[01:09.05]
[01:12.68]Now I'm climbing the walls
[01:16.41]But you don't notice at all
[01:20.45]That I'm going out of my mind
[01:24.28]All day and all night
[01:27.48]Some things gotta get loud
[01:31.14]Cause I'm dying just to know your name
[01:35.07]And I need you here with me now
[01:38.95]Cause you've got that one thing
[01:42.62]So get out, get out, get out of my head
[01:46.78]And fall into my arms instead
[01:50.59]I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
[01:54.33]But I need that one thing
[01:57.95]So get out, get out, get out of my mind
[02:02.00]And come on, come into my life
[02:06.36]I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
[02:10.11]But I need that one thing
[02:13.69]And you've got that one thing
[02:17.04]
[02:28.62]You've got that one thing
[02:32.69]Get out, get out, get out of my head
[02:36.28]And fall into my arms instead
[02:39.56]So get out, get out, get out of my head
[02:43.52]And fall into my arms instead

[02:51.33]But I need that one thing
[02:54.66]So Get out, get out, get out of my mind
[02:58.95]And come on, come into my life
