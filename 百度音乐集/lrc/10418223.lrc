[00:03.83]I Want You
[00:05.18]
[00:06.52]Bob Dylan
[00:08.68]
[00:15.99]The guilty undertaker sighs,
[00:18.35]The lonesome organ grinder cries,
[00:20.84]The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
[00:25.47]The cracked bells and washed-out horns
[00:28.12]Blow into my face with scorn,
[00:30.38]But it's not that way,
[00:31.39]I wasn't born to lose you.
[00:35.23]I want you, I want you,
[00:39.87]I want you so bad,
[00:44.09]Honey, I want you.
[00:49.69]The drunken politician leaps
[00:52.26]Upon the street where mothers weep
[00:54.60]And the saviors who are fast asleep,
[00:57.46]They wait for you.
[00:59.52]And I wait for them to interrupt
[01:01.88]Me drinkin' from my broken cup
[01:04.33]And ask me to
[01:05.79]Open up the gate for you.
[01:08.96]I want you, I want you,
[01:13.51]I want you so bad,
[01:17.77]Honey, I want you.
[01:23.32]Now all my fathers, they've gone down
[01:25.78]True love they've been without it.
[01:28.25]But all their daughters put me down
[01:30.50]'Cause I don't think about it.
[01:33.95]Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
[01:39.31]And talk with my chambermaid.
[01:41.69]She knows that I'm not afraid
[01:43.57]To look at her.
[01:46.56]She is good to me
[01:48.72]And there's nothing she doesn't see.
[01:51.11]She knows where I'd like to be
[01:52.94]But it doesn't matter.
[01:55.81]I want you, I want you,
[01:59.98]I want you so bad,
[02:04.32]Honey, I want you.
[02:08.70]Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
[02:12.51]He spoke to me, I took his flute.
[02:15.01]No, I wasn't very cute to him,
[02:17.15]Was I?
[02:19.92]But I did it, though, because he lied
[02:22.44]Because he took you for a ride
[02:25.11]And because time was on his side
[02:27.59]And because I . . .
[02:29.67]I want you, I want you,
[02:33.59]I want you so bad,
[02:38.07]Honey, I want you.
