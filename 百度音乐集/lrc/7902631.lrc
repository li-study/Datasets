[00:07.26]Ha, Ha, ahhh, Ha, Ha, ahhh
[00:11.96]The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
[00:16.72]Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
[00:21.71]The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
[00:26.74]But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated
[00:31.45]
[00:33.51]I start thinking about it,
[00:36.25]I almost forgot what it was like,
[00:38.53]to know what it feels like,
[00:41.30]With you
[00:43.17]I can let my hair down
[00:45.26]I can say anything crazy
[00:48.53]I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
[00:52.78]With nothing but a T-shirt on
[00:55.29]I never felt so beautiful
[00:58.12]Baby as I do now
[01:00.65]Now that I'm with you

[01:14.46]And just like that all my walls come down
[01:17.01]It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
[01:21.97]I relate to you naturally
[01:24.33]Everybody else just fades away
[01:26.96]Sometimes it's hard to breathe
