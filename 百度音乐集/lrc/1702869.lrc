[00:00.00]Vanessa Carlton - Afterglow
[00:13.38]
[00:15.38]Just when the day start getting colder
[00:22.43]I walk the streets I never knew
[00:29.37]There's some words that never told you
[00:35.05]The sounds brings out like truth
[00:43.51]
[00:44.43]And if you could see what's come over me
[00:51.36]then you would know
[00:58.30]Cause I'm walking free
[01:01.65]the wind at my back
[01:05.23]Bathed in afterglow
[01:08.33]
[01:11.56]And as I sit here in this dark room
[01:18.44]All I seem to feel is light
[01:25.43]And I see color
[01:27.13]I see the the ruin
[01:31.17]in the blood of this life that's ours
[01:40.22]
[01:40.58]And if you could see what's come over me
[01:47.61]then you would know
[01:54.39]Cause I'm walking free
[01:57.92]the wind at my back
[02:01.46]Bathed in after
[02:03.77]
[02:04.15]Watch the sun the pains are all in sky
[02:11.20]Laid me down and feel the days gone by
[02:22.94]
[02:32.08]Just when the day
[02:35.39]Just when the day
[02:38.42]
[02:46.53]Just when the day start getting longer
[02:53.26]I walk the streets I never knew
[02:59.07]The sun comes out for you
[03:07.56]
[03:08.62]And if you could see what's come over me
[03:15.23]then you would know
[03:32.77][03:22.21]Cause I'm walking free
[03:36.37][03:25.75]the wind at my back
[03:29.28]Bathed in after
[03:39.87]Bathed in afterglow
[03:45.05]
