[00:15.40]not long ago I was blinded more than ever
[00:20.28]those days we always stood together
[00:25.11]they told me how I was just infatuated
[00:29.98]it finally hit me good this time
[00:34.06]
[00:34.69]surrounding me was just pure confusion
[00:37.12]guess I was drowning in my own illusion
[00:39.69]you were the problem lying over it all
[00:44.72]why don't I just jump off this edge?
[00:48.21]it's gonna be sensational
[00:52.77]
[00:53.24]I'm Fallin' Free Fallin'
[00:58.17]A city far along
[01:00.86]Soon I will be gone
[01:03.60]Fallin' I'm Fallin' Down Down Down...
[01:13.50]My new beginning today
[01:16.14]
[01:25.74]I've had enough, why don't you call me when you're sober
[01:30.49]although we all know that it's over
[01:35.25]no more letters telling me that you are sorry
[01:40.16]that whole routine makes you look lame
[01:44.21]
[01:44.88]all of my smiles that you confiscated
[01:47.28]I have a feeling that my time was wasted
[01:49.76]and now I know that I am ready to go
[01:55.00]don't need to have your love no more
[01:58.29]because I came here all alone
[02:02.95]
[02:03.44]I'm Fallin' Free Fallin'
[02:08.31]To somewhere I belong
[02:11.06]A place to call my home
[02:13.77]Fallin' I'm Fallin' Down Down Down...
[02:23.73]my life it starts out today
[02:26.23]
[02:45.25]Bye bye, I'm saying so long to you
[02:49.14]all those memories that I'll have to get over yeah
[02:55.20]don't wanna take this pain, oh no
[02:58.83]so go on right now,
[03:00.67]just take it away
[03:03.08]I'll take it away...
[03:07.14]
[03:07.58]I'm Fallin' Free Fallin'
[03:12.41]A city far along
[03:15.22]Soon I will be gone
[03:17.91]Fallin' I'm Fallin' Down Down Down...
[03:26.95]I'm Fallin' Free Fallin'
[03:31.79]To somewhere I belong
[03:34.53]A place to call my home
[03:37.34]Fallin' I'm Fallin' Down Down Down...
[03:46.57]
[03:47.30]my new beginning today...
[03:52.13]my life it starts out today...
[03:56.97]my new beginning today
