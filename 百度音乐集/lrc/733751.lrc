[00:07.56]Joni Mitchell"The Circle Game"歌词
[00:10.01]Yesterday a child came out to wonder
[00:18.44]Caught a dragon fly inside a jar
[00:26.96]Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
[00:34.09]And tearful at the falling of a star
[00:42.59]And the seasons they go round and round
[00:46.81]And the painted ponies go up and down
[00:52.09]We're captive on the carousel of time
[00:59.96]We can't return we can only look behind from where we came
[01:07.02]And go round and round and round in the circle game
[01:16.00]Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
[01:24.07]Skated over ten clear frozen streams
[01:32.01]Words like when you're older must appease him
[01:39.78]And promises of someday make his dreams
[01:47.94]And the seasons they go round and round
[01:51.90]And the painted ponies go up and down
[01:57.55]We're captive on the carousel of time
[02:05.02]We can't return we can only look behind from where we came
[02:12.04]And go round and round and round in the circle game
[02:21.24]Six-teen springs and six-teen summers gone now
[02:29.03]Cart-wheels turn to car-wheels thou' the town
[02:35.89]And they tell him take you're time it won't be long now
[02:45.05]Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
[02:52.95]And the seasons they go round and round
[02:57.06]And the painted ponies go up and down
[03:01.91]We're captive on the carousel of time
[03:10.07]We can't return we can only look behind from where we came
[03:16.99]And go round and round and round in the circle game
[03:25.06]So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
[03:33.14]Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
[03:41.83]There's be new dreams may be better dreams and plenty
[03:49.05]Before the last revolving year is through
[03:57.98]And the seasons they go round and round
[04:02.00]And the painted ponies go up and down
[04:06.99]We're captive on the carousel of time
[04:15.03]We can't return we can only look behind from where we came
[04:22.05]And go round and round and round in the circle game
[04:29.96]And go round and round and round in the circle game
[04:36.00]。。。。。。。。。。
