[00:02.31]Should It Matter
[00:05.69]Sissel
[00:08.69]
[00:17.46]I look at you
[00:20.56]Please don't walk away
[00:27.47]I see you're about to
[00:33.42]There is just something I'd really like to say
[00:42.31]So please don't walk away
[00:49.80]I know that you're there
[00:52.24]Still you pretend you're not
[00:56.20]Yes I know it hurts
[00:58.59]I have also felt the pain
[01:05.71]So should it matter
[01:08.31]What I do or what I've done
[01:13.65]As long as in my heart
[01:16.66]You're still the only one
[01:21.76]I hear you say it
[01:24.23]But I don't think you understand
[01:30.09]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[01:39.95]It's been a year
[01:42.87]A memory from my past
[01:48.96]I know what I did wrong
[01:56.03]I wish to change
[01:59.16]Just to make it last
[02:04.74]But I guess it's been to long
[02:12.31]Easy to move on
[02:14.76]To forget about it all
[02:18.76]Is that what you do, hoping I will be gone
[02:27.97]So should it matter
[02:30.84]What I do or what I've done
[02:36.21]As long as in my heart
[02:39.11]You're still the only one
[02:44.22]I hear you say it
[02:46.62]But I don't think you understand
[02:52.50]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[03:00.33]If you got to know me again
[03:08.51]Maybe then - maybe then
[03:16.71]We could see what we should do
[03:21.25]
[03:25.48]But that's all up to you
[03:32.74]I'll be waiting for you
[03:40.50]So should it matter
[03:42.59]What I do or what I've done
[03:48.68]As long as in my heart
[03:51.59]You're still the only one
[03:56.66]I hear you say it
[03:59.38]But I don't think you understand
[04:04.96]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
[04:12.70]So should it matter
[04:15.61]What I do or what I've done
[04:20.82]As long as in my heart
[04:23.76]You're still the only one
[04:28.96]I hear you say it
[04:31.34]But I don't think you understand
[04:37.15]I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
