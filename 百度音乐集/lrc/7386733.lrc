[00:10.06]I get no kick from champagne
[00:15.99]Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
[00:21.15]So tell me why should it be true
[00:27.24]That I get a kick out of you
[00:33.90]Some get their kicks from cocaine
[00:39.84]I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
[00:44.99]That would bore me terrifically too
[00:51.12]Yet I get a kick out of you
[00:57.87][02:09.46]I get a kick every time I see you
[01:04.02][02:15.67]Standing there before me
[01:09.72][02:21.45]I get a kick though it's clear to me
[01:14.96][02:26.64]You obviously don't adore me
[01:21.69]I get no kick in a plane
[01:27.64][02:39.28]Flying too high with some guy in the sky
[01:32.85][02:44.15]Is my idea of nothing to do
[01:38.89][02:50.50]But I get a kick out of you
[02:33.34]I get no kicks in a plane
