[00:00.91]
[00:11.98]Lying with you reminds me of those days
[00:17.69]Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave
[00:23.26]Mother's in the garden inviting everyone
[00:28.02]Ooh, we pull up our old jeans and go outside
[00:33.88]Neighbour's always smiling with the baby on her knee
[00:39.34]Mia's sitting on the front step getting her hair combed out in weaves
[00:44.96]Music, bass is boomin' from the car parked in the street
[00:50.52]Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
[00:55.40]
[00:56.92]I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
[01:02.31]I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
[01:07.81]Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
[01:13.26]I just like to make a scene
[01:16.02]I just like the sympathy
[01:19.03]
[01:30.29]Growing up we didn't have a lot of money
[01:35.81]Used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
[01:41.24]Plastic cups for all and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet
[01:46.50]Women discussing what love is like, ooh you know what I mean
[01:52.26]And I'm just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
[01:57.91]Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
[02:03.43]
[02:04.25]I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you

[02:20.66]I just like to make a scene
[02:23.11]I just like the sympathy
[02:26.21]
[02:26.95]Maybe then I will know I want somebody
[02:31.99]Maybe then I used to dream of someone to love
[02:37.64]Now you come and you invite me
[02:43.23]I know I'm in love
[02:47.99]
[02:49.28]I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
[02:54.43]I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you
