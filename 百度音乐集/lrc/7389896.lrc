[00:03.39]Bon Jovi
[00:05.57]
[00:11.08]Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
[00:18.39]Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
[00:25.68]Mama, can you help me try to understand
[00:29.16]Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
[00:32.78]My daddy lived a lie
[00:34.46]Its just the price that he paid
[00:36.51]Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
[00:40.62]Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
[00:45.45]That gets me through the night
[00:47.70]I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
[00:52.74]I'm gonna live my life
[00:55.02]Shining like a diamond
[00:56.83]Rolling with the dice
[00:58.61]Standing on the ledge
[01:00.23]Just show the wind how to fly
[01:02.33]When the world gets in my face
[01:05.51]I say, have a nice day
[01:11.01]Have a nice day
[01:15.31]Take a look around you, nothings what it seems
[01:22.40]We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
[01:29.99]Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
[01:33.72]Everybody, brave enough to take a stand
[01:37.01]I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
[01:41.03]Looking for forgiveness
[01:42.57]What’s left to believe?
[01:46.62]Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
[01:52.10]That gets me through the night
[01:54.44]I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
[01:59.43]I'm gonna live my life
[02:01.61]Shining like a diamond
[02:03.43]Rolling with the dice
[02:05.20]Standing on the ledge
[02:06.83]Just show the wind how to fly
[02:08.94]When the world gets in my face
[02:12.13]I say, have a nice day
[02:17.67]Have a nice day
[02:21.04]
[02:46.00]Ohhh
[02:49.67]Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
[02:54.55]That gets me through the night
[02:56.88]I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
[03:02.30]I'm gonna live my life
[03:04.64]Shining like a diamond
[03:06.45]Rolling with the dice
[03:08.28]Standing on the ledge
[03:09.79]Just show the wind how to fly
[03:11.91]When the world gets in my face
[03:15.10]I say, have a nice day
[03:20.52]Have a nice day
[03:24.27]Have a nice day
[03:28.44]Now when this world keeps trying, to drag me down
[03:32.03]I've gotta raise my hands
[03:33.86]Gonna stand my ground
[03:35.61]I say, hey, have a nice day
[03:42.62]Have a nice day
[03:46.33]Have a nice day
[03:47.86]
