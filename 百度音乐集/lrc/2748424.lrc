[00:05.00]《Again》
[00:10.00]Janet Jackson
[00:12.00]
[00:16.00]I heard from a friend today
[00:19.00]And she said you were in town
[00:22.00]Suddenly the memories came back
[00:26.00]To me in my mind
[00:30.00]How can I be strong I've asked myself
[00:34.00]Time and time I've said
[00:37.00]That I'll never fall in love with you again
[00:44.00]A wounded heart you gave
[00:46.00]My soul you took away
[00:52.00]Good intentions you had many
[00:56.00]I know you did
[00:59.00]I come from a place that hurts
[01:02.00]God knows how I've cried
[01:07.00]And I never want to return
[01:11.00]Never fall again
[01:17.00]
[01:22.00]Making love to you felt so good and
[01:26.00]Oh so right
[01:29.00]How can I be strong I've asked myself
[01:33.00]Time and time I've said
[01:36.00]That I'll never fall in love with you again
[01:43.00]So here we are alone again
[01:46.00]Didn't think I'd come to this
[01:51.00]And to know it all began
[01:54.00]With just a little kiss
[01:58.00]I've come too close to happiness
[02:01.00]To have it swept away
[02:06.00]Don't think I can take the pain
[02:10.00]No never fall again
[02:18.00]
[02:21.00]Kinda late in the game
[02:24.00]And my heart is in your hands
[02:28.00]Don't you stand there and then tell me
[02:31.00]You love me
[02:33.00]Then leave again
[02:39.00]Cause I'm falling in love with you again
[02:51.00]
[02:55.00]Hold me, hold me
[03:04.00]Don't ever let me go
[03:08.00]Say it just one time
[03:12.00]Say you love me
[03:17.00]God knows I do love you again
[03:28.00]
