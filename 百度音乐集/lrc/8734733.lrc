[00:11.21]3LW Christmas Love lyrics
[00:13.86]Early in the morning
[00:16.55]I smell the breakfast
[00:19.76]Mama's gone and dressed up the table
[00:23.73]I love this time of the year
[00:28.75]At a time when I know I should be nothing but thankful
[00:36.38]Something's got me sitting here troubled
[00:40.30]And I've been thinking about it
[00:43.83]And I don't understand that so much one day love
[00:48.23]Shouldn't just be at this time of the year
[00:53.17]The love that you be showin your Family and friends should be
[00:59.21]Always and forever love
[01:02.65]Not just Christmas love
[01:05.20]Shouldn't just be at this time of year
[01:09.47]He gave his life for you
[01:16.61]Always and forever love
[01:19.39]Not just Christmas love
[01:21.64]All of the children are outside playin
[01:27.39]And all the parents in the house singing
[01:30.85]There's so much joy in the air
[01:35.32]But what about yesterday?
[01:40.17]And what about tomorrow when the snow melts away?
[01:44.10]And what about the other day after?
[01:47.81]Will we realize that his love is forever and always?
[01:55.95]Shouldn't just be at this time of the year
[02:00.90]The love that you be showin your Family and friends should be
[02:07.13]Always and forever love
[02:10.66]Not just Christmas love
[02:13.11]Shouldn't just be at this time of year
[02:18.00]He gave his life for you
[02:21.79]Just to show you his love for you
[02:24.20]Always and forever love
[02:27.06]Not just Christmas love
[02:30.17]Shouldn't just be at this time of the year
[02:33.94]The love that you be showin your Family and friends should be
[02:41.49]Always and forever love
[02:43.82]Not just Christmas love
[02:47.16]Shouldn't just be at this time of year
[02:51.70]He gave his life for you
[02:54.47]Just to show you his love for you
[02:57.85]Always and forever love
[03:01.18]Not just Christmas love
[03:12.06]What about yesterday?
[03:15.16]The day after and the day after that?
[03:21.77]Shouldn't just be at this time of year
