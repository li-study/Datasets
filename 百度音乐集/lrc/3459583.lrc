[00:16.73]
[00:18.73]And do you still touch her like you do
[00:27.61]Kiss her all over in the way I kissed with you
[00:36.29]And when you sleep with her,
[00:39.08]do you sometimes think of me
[00:44.83]Not if you love her the way that I see
[00:49.25]
[00:51.31]I had to be free
[00:53.69]Had to be free
[00:55.61]It's all that I wanted
[00:59.47]
[00:59.95]I wanted to see
[01:02.18]Wanted to be
[01:04.21]Alone if I needed
[01:08.13]
[01:08.65]I had to be free
[01:10.89]Had to be free
[01:12.90]From feelings that haunted
[01:16.84]
[01:17.35]I wanted to see
[01:19.56]Wanted to be
[01:22.72]Free
[01:27.62]
[01:45.50]And then in the evening light,
[01:48.58]when the bars of freedom fall
[01:54.35]I watch the two of you in the shadows on the wall
[02:03.06]How in the darkness steals
[02:05.59]some of the choices from my hand
[02:11.52]Then will I begin to understand
[02:15.77]
[02:18.06]I had to be free
[02:20.39]Had to be free
[02:22.44]It's all that I wanted
[02:26.23]
[02:26.75]I wanted to see
[02:29.09]Wanted to be
[02:31.12]Alone if I needed
[02:35.01]
[02:35.47]I had to be free
[02:37.79]Had to be free
[02:39.71]From feelings that haunted
[02:43.68]
[02:44.25]I wanted to see
[02:46.45]Wanted to be
[02:49.67]Free
[02:54.40]
[03:01.65]I had to be free
[03:03.92]Had to be free
[03:05.93]It's all that I wanted
[03:09.64]
