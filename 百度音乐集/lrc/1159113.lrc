[00:09.28]Don't hang up, can't we talk
[00:13.07]So confused it's like I'm lost
[00:16.72]What went wrong, what made you go
[00:20.24]Don't pretend you don't know
[00:24.01]This is me I'm unchangable
[00:29.19]
[00:31.24]When did we fall apart
[00:34.77]Or did you lie from the start
[00:38.40]When you said, it's only you
[00:42.01]I was blind, such a fool
[00:45.65]Thinking we were unbreakable
[00:51.10]
[00:52.09]It was you and me, against the world
[00:59.37]And you promised me forever more
[01:05.41]Was it something that I said
[01:08.78]Was it something that I did
[01:12.54]Cause I gotta know what made me unbeautiful
[01:19.69]
[01:22.18]I've been told what's done is done
[01:25.61]To let it go and carry on
[01:29.30]Deep inside I know that's true
[01:32.84]I'm stuck in time, stuck on you
[01:36.63]We were still untouchable
[01:41.49]
[01:42.95]It was you and me, against the world
[01:50.23]And you promised me forever more
[01:56.32]Was it something that I said
[01:59.71]Was it something that I did
[02:03.51]Cause I gotta know what made me unbeautiful
[02:09.27]
[02:09.47]Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
[02:11.98]Cause I'm only dreaming
[02:16.60]Get out, get out, get out, get out
[02:19.39]Get out of my head now
[02:23.19]Because we're much better altogether
[02:31.54]
[02:37.48]It was you and me, against the world
[02:44.67]And you promised me forever more
[02:50.68]Was it something that I said
[02:54.24]Was it something that I did
[02:57.96]Cause I gotta know what made me unbeautiful
[03:04.90]
[03:06.68]It was you and me, against the world
[03:13.82]And you promised me forever more
[03:19.87]Was it something that I said
[03:23.37]Was it something that I did
[03:27.03]Cause I gotta know what made me unbeautiful
[03:35.59]
[03:36.50]made me unbeautiful
