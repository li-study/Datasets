[00:06.27]I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
[00:08.55]The reason you have the courage to confront your fears
[00:11.14]The reason there's two carrots in each of your ears

[00:23.89]So when I shine, you shine
[00:26.11]C'mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life
[00:28.88]Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice

[00:34.25]I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose
[00:36.65]ye~ye~
[00:37.36]It's funny cause, for a while
[00:39.39]I walked around with a smile but
[00:41.98]Deep inside, I could hear
[00:44.57]voices telling me this ain't right
[00:47.15]Don't you know, it's not for you
[00:49.56]I always knew what I had to do
[00:52.33]But it's hard, to get away
[00:54.92]Because I love you I just tried to stay
[02:49.15][00:57.14][01:07.27][01:37.95][03:00.05][03:40.79][01:48.25][03:30.48]I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
[03:01.95][02:51.84][01:50.34][00:59.16][01:09.49][03:32.64][01:40.17][03:42.79]After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
[02:54.28][01:01.93][01:12.06][01:42.58][01:52.92][03:45.28][03:35.04][03:04.56]Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
[01:04.50][01:45.26][02:56.86][03:37.57]And I know inside I'm be alright
[01:14.74][01:55.57][03:06.97][03:47.89]And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
[01:18.35]Friends of mine, say to me
[01:20.38]They say you got control over me
[01:22.97]You're not alone, I played my part
[01:25.75]I saw the way you were from the start
[01:27.97]Could I expect, so much from you
[01:30.74]You had a girl when I first met you
[01:33.14]Did the best that you could do
[01:35.43]Now I realize I can't change you
[01:58.84]Said I wouldn't walk away
[02:02.18]Some days I want to stay
[02:04.98]But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
[02:09.11]Never thought it would be true
[02:12.79]Me livin' without you
[02:15.41]But now it's time for me to make that move
[02:19.12]Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it
[02:21.27]When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it
[02:23.49]You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you
[02:26.63]I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
[02:29.04]All the talkin on the phone, all the time we share
[02:31.42]How could you fix your mouth to say, I don't care?
[02:34.28]I had plans for us, to buy ice together
[02:36.99]Engagement rings, and things and share life together
[02:39.37]Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you're like whatever
[02:42.09]Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start
[02:44.32]Or was it my actions that made us fall apart
[02:47.06]Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart
[03:12.39]Oh no
[03:19.64]be alright
[03:24.09]Oh no
[03:29.22]says I'm gonna be alright
