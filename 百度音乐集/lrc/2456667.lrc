[00:16.20]It is the evening of the day
[00:23.55]I sit and watch the children play
[00:31.04]Smiling faces I can see
[00:34.78]But not for me
[00:38.49]I sit and watch
[00:41.36]As tears go by
[00:45.99]My riches can't buy everything
[00:53.57]I want to hear the children sing
[01:00.97]All I hear is the sound
[01:04.90]Of rain falling on the ground
[01:08.60]I sit and watch
[01:11.24]As tears go by
[01:14.88]
[01:46.12]It is the evening of the day
[01:53.61]I sit and watch the children play
[02:01.24]Doing things I used to do
[02:04.98]They think are new
[02:08.38]I sit and watch
[02:10.90]As tears go by
[02:16.33]Um，Um……
