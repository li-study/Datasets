[00:24.58]If I had the chance, love
[00:28.64]I would not hesitate
[00:35.48]To tell you all the things I never said before
[00:41.44]Don't tell me it's too late
[00:44.42]
[00:45.65]Cause I've relied on my illusions
[00:53.27]To keep me warm at night
[00:58.23]But I denied in my capacity to love
[01:03.81]I am willing, to give up this fight
[01:08.53]
[01:10.64]I've been up all night drinking
[01:16.25]To drown my sorrow down
[01:23.05]Nothing seems to help me since you went away
[01:27.96]I'm so tired of this town
[01:34.26]Where every tongue is wagging
[01:39.43]When every back is turned
[01:45.64]Their telling secrets that should never be revealed
[01:51.37]There's nothing to be gained from this
[01:57.81]But disaster..
[02:00.84]Here's a good one..
[02:03.62]Did you hear about my friend
[02:09.12]He's embarrassed to be seen now
[02:15.68]Because we..
[02:21.18]Oh no.
[02:26.33]Be seen..
[02:32.56]
[02:52.06]If I had the chance love
[02:56.41]You know, I would not hesitate
[03:03.68]To tell you all the things I never said before
[03:09.10]Don't tell me it's too late
[03:11.99]
[03:13.47]Cause I've relied on my illusions
[03:21.09]To keep me warm at night
[03:25.99]But I denied in my capacity to love
[03:31.65]I am willing, to give up this fight
[03:37.26]Oh, I am willing to give up this fight..
