[00:21.58]Money talks
[00:24.51]But it don't sing and dance
[00:26.81]And it don't walk
[00:29.92]As long as I can have you here with me
[00:34.46]I'd much rather be
[00:37.07]Forever in blue jeans
[00:42.55]Honey's sweet
[00:45.91]But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
[00:51.01]And if you pardon me
[00:53.25]I'd like to say
[00:55.92]We'll do okay
[00:58.22]Forever in blue jeans
[01:04.82]Maybe tonight
[01:07.93]Maybe tonight,by the fire all alone,you and I
[01:17.63]Nothing around
[01:19.19]But the sound of my heart
[01:21.81]And your sighs
[01:27.97]Money talks
[01:31.14]But it can't sing and dance
[01:33.19]And it can't walk
[01:36.55]As long as I can have you here with me
[01:40.84]I'd much rather be
[01:43.25]Forever in blue jeans, babe
[01:48.97]Honey's sweet
[01:52.08]But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
[01:57.30]And if you pardon me
[01:59.48]I'd like to say
[02:02.09]We'll do okay
[02:04.33]Forever in blue jeans
[02:10.31]Maybe tonight
[02:14.29]Maybe tonight,by the fire all alone,you and I
[02:23.44]Nothing around
[02:25.12]But the sound of my heart
[02:27.64]And your sighs
[02:33.80]Money talks
[02:36.97]But it don't sing and dance
[02:38.52]And it don't walk
[02:42.26]And long as I can have you here with me
[02:46.42]I'd much rather be
