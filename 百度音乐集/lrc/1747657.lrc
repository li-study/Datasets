[00:05.41][00:12.54][03:56.41]
[00:16.55]I want to trip inside your head
[00:20.50]Spend the day there...
[00:24.22]To hear the things you haven't said
[00:28.03]And see what you might see
[00:31.89]I want to hear you when you call
[00:35.62]Do you feel anything at all?
[00:39.57]I want to see your thoughts take shape
[00:43.47]And walk right out
[00:46.26]Freedom has a scent
[00:49.72]Like the top of a new born baby's head
[00:53.56][01:54.73][03:15.02]The songs are in your eyes
[00:57.44][01:58.50][03:18.98]I see them when you smile
[01:01.20]I've had enough I'm not giving up
[01:05.01]On a miracle drug
[01:17.77]Of science and the human heart
[01:21.44]There is no limit
[01:25.26]There is no failure here sweetheart
[01:29.12]Just when you quit...
[01:32.94]I am you and you are mine
[01:36.75]Love makes nonsense of space
[01:39.73]And time...will disappear
[01:43.52]Love and logic keep us clear
[01:47.38]Reason is on our side, love...
[02:02.29][03:22.57]I've had enough of romantic love
[02:06.31]I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
[02:10.12]For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug
[02:38.38]God I need your help tonight
[03:00.03]Beneath the noise
[03:01.64]Below the din
[03:03.45]I hear a voice
[03:05.17]It's whispering
[03:07.27]In science and in medicine
[03:11.16]"I was a stranger
[03:13.07]You took me in"
[03:26.19]Yeah, I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
[03:30.58]For a miracle, miracle drug
[03:38.32]Miracle, miracle drug
[03:47.00][03:48.49]
