[00:02.00]
[00:06.00]Standing in the bar
[00:07.00]checking out each other
[00:09.00]each and everyone
[00:10.00]cooler than the other
[00:12.00]this is a place where everything is madness
[00:19.00]Dancing on the chairs
[00:21.00]hanging on each other
[00:22.00]each and every girl
[00:24.00]sweeter than the other
[00:26.00]music so loud that we have to drink our brains out
[00:33.00]It takes an awfull time to get a cocktail
[00:40.00]I've never been so crowded in my life
[00:47.00]I'm shouting at my date with the red nails
[00:53.00]come take my hand and let's get out
[00:58.00]and she said
