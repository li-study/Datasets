[00:19.21]Christmas ain't the same without you
[00:24.09]
[00:28.76]Waiting for the day I see you again
[00:33.54]
[00:37.99]It's Christmas night
[00:39.84]I'm by the fireside
[00:42.20]Wishing that you and I
[00:44.78](Could share our love one last time)
[00:47.62]And, baby, I - I need you near me

[01:02.24]Holding you close, this is my Christmas wish
[01:06.77]Christmas ain't the same without you
[01:11.50]It just doesn't feel like it used to
[01:16.20]Waiting for the day I see you again
[01:20.92]I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then
[01:26.54]
[01:35.14]Baby, I made some mistakes that I
[01:39.20]Deeply regret inside
[01:41.66](Why can't we give one more try)
[01:44.32]I loved you, girl, with all of my heart
[01:48.99]Right from the start
[01:51.33]Thought we'd never part(oh, no)
[01:54.42]Craving your touch and your eternal bliss
[01:59.26]That is my only Christmas wish
[02:03.50]Christmas ain't the same without you

[02:17.24]I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then
[02:22.46]Christmas ain't the same without you
[02:27.27]It just doesn't feel like it used to
[02:32.01]Waiting for the day I see you again
[02:36.70]I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then
[02:43.85]
[02:49.58]Oh no no ...
[02:54.51]
[02:55.73]I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then
[03:00.68]Christmas ain't the same without you...
[03:04.80]The same...
[03:07.50]Christmas ain't the same without you
[03:12.35]It just doesn't feel like it used to
