[00:44.23]Dream Theater    Awake
[00:55.11]By Ayan.SayNo
[01:07.66]'love, just don't stare'
[01:16.53]He used to say to me
[01:20.18]Every sunday morning
[01:23.92]The spider in the window
[01:28.65]The angel in the pool
[01:31.67]The old man takes the poison
[01:35.11]Now the widow makes the rules
[01:39.19]
[01:54.22]'so speak, i'm right here'
[02:02.24]She used to say to me
[02:06.27]Not a word, not a word
[02:11.19]Judas on the ceiling
[02:14.66]The devil in my bed
[02:18.24]I guess easter's never coming
[02:22.25]So i'll just wait inside my head
[02:27.97]
[02:42.75]Like a scream but sort of silent
[02:46.28]Living off my nightmares
[02:51.10]
[02:51.99]Voices repeating me
[02:57.53]'feeling threatened?
[03:00.29]We reflect your hopes and fears.'
[03:04.70]Voices discussing me
[03:10.12]'others steal your thoughts
[03:12.63]They're not confined
[03:13.98]Within your mind.'
[03:16.63]
[03:26.03]Thought disorder
[03:27.50]Dream control
[03:29.13]Now they read my mind on the radio
[03:34.60]But where was the garden of eden?
[03:36.99]
[03:40.10]I feel elated
[03:41.61]I feel depressed
[03:43.63]Sex is death, death is sex
[03:48.93]Says it right here on my crucifix
[03:52.04]
[03:54.71]Like a scream but sort of silent
[03:58.06]Living off my nightmares
[04:02.34]
[04:03.39]Voices protecting me
[04:08.72]'good behavior
[04:11.62]Brings the savior
[04:13.63]To his knees.'
[04:16.17]Voices rejecting me
[04:21.53]'others steal your thoughts
[04:23.95]They're not confined
[04:25.80]To your own mind.'
[04:28.87]
[04:29.63]"i don't wanna be here, 'cause of my
[04:32.27]Suffering, 'cause of my illness.
[04:36.01]Only love is worth having, only
[04:40.21]Love is what matters, loving every
[04:42.79]People on equal terms. "
[04:44.73]"you've got to know who you're
[04:46.48]Dealin' with because, like a stranger,
[04:48.01]A-heh, just might come in through
[04:51.33]Here with a gun... and then, what
[04:53.66]Would you do? (heh.)"
[04:56.38]"everything is immaterial..."
[04:59.27]"'n' you know that reality is immaterial."
[05:01.48]"this is not reality..."
[05:06.98]
[05:14.21]I'm kneeling on the floor
[05:18.54]Staring at the wall
[05:22.07]Like the spider in the window
[05:26.00]I wish that i could speak
[05:29.71]Is there fantasy in refuge?
[05:33.36]God in politicians?
[05:36.70]Should i turn on my religion?
[05:40.37]These demons in my head tell me to
[05:46.58]
[06:11.23]I'm lying here in bed
[06:15.46]Swear my skin is inside out
[06:19.15]Just another sunday morning
[06:25.45]
[06:25.88]Seen my diary on the newsstand
[06:28.95]Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
[06:31.18]It's a shame no one is praying
[06:35.23]'cause these voices in my head
[06:38.82]Keep saying...
[06:41.78]
[06:43.24]'love, just don't stare.'
[06:48.40]'reveal the word when you're
[06:49.86]Supposed to'
[06:53.49]Withdrawn and introverted
[06:56.69]Infectiously perverted
[06:59.92]'being laughed at and confused
[07:03.29]Keeps us pleasantly amused
[07:06.79]Enough to stay.'
[07:08.61]
[08:19.15]Maybe i'm just cassandra fleeting
[08:22.09]Twentieth century icon bleeding
[08:25.51]Willing to risk salvation
[08:29.20]To escape from isolation
[08:31.84]
[08:32.46]I'm witness to redemption
[08:35.26]Heard you speak but never listened
[08:38.28]Can you rid me of my secrets?
[08:42.21]Deliver us from darkness?
[08:45.81]
[08:53.60]Voices repeating me
[09:00.39]'feeling threatened?
[09:03.32]We reflect your hopes and fears.'
[09:07.29]Voices discussing me
[09:12.74]Don't expect your own messiah
[09:16.13]This neverworld which you desire
[09:19.46]Is only in your mind.
