[00:04.00]
[00:10.93]If you go away
[00:15.06]On this summer's day
[00:18.00]Then you might as well
[00:20.76]Take the sun away
[00:23.62]All the birds that flew
[00:26.27]In the summer sky
[00:29.07]When our love was new
[00:31.52]And our hearts were high
[00:34.57]And the day was young
[00:37.53]And the nights were long
[00:40.27]And the moon stood still
[00:42.94]For the night bird's song
[00:45.61]
[00:46.11]If you go away
[00:49.48]If you go away
[00:52.62]If you go away...
[00:56.84]
[00:58.31]But if you stay
[01:04.71]I'll make you a day
[01:07.26]Like no day has been
[01:10.25]Or will be again
[01:12.86]We'll sail on the sun
[01:15.38]We'll ride on the rain
[01:17.68]We'll talk to the trees
[01:20.64]And worship the wind
[01:23.62]But if you go
[01:26.66]I'll understand
[01:27.94]Leave me just enough love
[01:31.23]To fill up my hand
[01:34.32]If you go away
[01:36.80]If you go away
[01:39.73]If you go away...
[01:44.39]
[01:45.38]Ne me quitte pas
[01:48.41]Il faut oublier
[01:51.27]Tout peut s'oublier
[01:53.64]Qui s'enfuit déjà
[01:56.19]Oublier le temps
[01:58.62]Des malentendus
[02:02.04]Et le temps perdu
[02:04.53]A savoir comment
[02:07.14]Oublier ces heures
[02:09.83]Qui tuaient parfois
[02:12.55]A coups de pourquoi
[02:15.12]Le coeur du bonheur
[02:17.66]Ne me quitte pas
[02:20.19]Ne me quitte pas
[02:23.09]Ne me quitte pas
[02:25.32]
[02:27.85]But if you stay
[02:32.69]I'll make you a night
[02:35.13]Like no night has been
[02:37.83]Or will be again
[02:40.50]I'll sail on your smile
[02:43.03]I'll ride on your touch
[02:45.32]I'll talk to your eyes
[02:47.93]That I love so much
[02:51.29]But if you go
[02:52.75]I'll understand
[02:54.83]Leave me just enough love
[02:58.47]To hold in my hand
[03:01.35]If you go away
[03:03.69]If you go away
[03:06.34]If you go away...
[03:11.50]If you go away
[03:15.95]As I know you must
[03:18.59]There is nothing left
[03:21.07]In this world to trust
[03:24.02]Just an empty room
[03:25.92]Full of empty space
[03:29.58]Like the empty look
[03:31.37]I see on your face
[03:34.97]Though I would have been the shadow
[03:38.02]Of your shadow
[03:40.48]If you might have kept me
[03:42.47]By your side
[03:45.98]
[03:46.51]If you go away
[03:49.87]If you go away
[03:54.25]Please don't go away...
[04:05.98]
