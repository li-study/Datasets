[00:00.57]Set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
[00:05.40]We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race
[00:10.22](Let's go!)
[00:11.18]Take a breath and explode like bullets
[00:13.40]Tearing through the wind
[00:16.19]Cut me up with a razor blade
[00:18.41]That tries to separate the skin
[00:20.77]Now in the
[00:21.40]White flames of burning flags

[00:46.44]Save me
[00:47.65]What if we

[00:59.72]Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
[01:05.43]feel me rise in the strength I've found inside the warm embracing air
[01:12.02]I'm moving slow
[01:13.48]Like a glacier melting
[01:14.28]Watch me dissipate
[01:16.48]I searched for love in an empty world
[01:18.82]But all I found was hate
[01:20.96]Now in the
[01:21.83]White flames of burning flags
[01:25.11]We found a world worth dying for, yeah

[01:45.21]From this world

[02:19.93]'Cuz I don't know
[02:22.16]These things I'll never face
[02:23.87]Scratch out but won't erase
[02:28.19]In the wreckage of a job well done
[02:30.16]I saw a place I'd never seen before, yeah
[02:32.35]In that moment I refused to close my eyes anymore
[02:38.71]So Take me
[02:39.98]From this world
[02:41.30]Save me
[02:42.79]What if we
[02:44.03]All die young
[02:49.65]So take me
[02:50.98]From this world
[02:52.31]Save me
[02:53.57]What if we
