[00:19.16]Well, I am what I am
[00:21.03]What I am could be who you are
[00:26.78]Yes, you're pained when you smile
[00:28.73]Because you built a wall around your heart
[00:34.37]Do the thoughts in your head keep you up
[00:37.50]Cause you feel alone
[00:42.61]And are you strong enough to be yourself
[00:50.23]Papa used to say you're just a loser
[00:52.86]And you're never gonna have what it takes
[00:57.96]Mama used to say all that loud music you play
[01:01.35]Ain't gonna get you nowhere
[01:03.85]
[01:09.09]You gotta be yourself
[01:16.84]You gotta be yourself
[01:20.86]If you cried would you hide
[01:22.51]Would you want all the world to know
[01:28.60]And if you believed in love
[01:31.26]Would you let it show
[01:36.14]How you win
[01:37.27]How you hate
[01:38.15]Are you cool
[01:39.09]Do you try too hard
[01:44.05]Or are you strong enough to be yourself
[01:51.71]Papa used to say you're just a loser
[01:54.17]And you're never gonna have what it takes
[01:59.45]Mama used to say all that loud music you play
[02:02.79]Ain't gonna get you nowhere

[02:21.59]
[02:25.90]You gotta be yourself
[02:33.64]You gotta be yourself
[02:36.65]
[02:52.82]If you can't, can't be yourself
[02:56.61]What are you living for
[03:00.54]If you can't, can't be yourself
[03:04.11]You're gonna lose it all
[03:08.08]If you can't, can't be yourself
[03:11.88]What are you living for
[03:15.76]You're gonna find someday
[03:17.76]You're gotta run away
[03:19.55]You gotta run, run, run away
[03:25.54]
