[00:19.00]Title: My Friend Of Misery
[01:05.21]You just stood there screaming
[01:08.31]Fearing no one was listening to you
[01:12.04]They say the empty can rattles the most
[01:15.79]The sound of your own voice must soothe you
[01:20.27]Hearing only what you want to hear
[01:23.73]And knowing only what you've heard
[01:26.98]You, you're smothered in tragedy
[01:31.20]And you're out to save the world
[01:39.15]Misery
[01:40.95]You insist that the weight of the world
[01:44.81]Should be on your shoulders
[01:47.12]Misery
[01:49.07]There's much more to life than what you see
[01:52.85]My friend of misery
[01:59.54]
[02:16.59]You still stood there screaming
[02:20.20]No one caring about these words you tell
[02:24.66]My friend, before your voice is gone
[02:28.24]One man's fun is another's hell
[02:32.76]These times are sent to try men's souls
[02:36.58]But something's wrong with all you see
[02:40.21]You, you'll take it on all yourself
[02:44.76]Remember, misery loves company
[02:52.17]Misery
[02:55.14]You insist that the weight of the world
[02:56.73]Should be on your shoulders
[02:59.94]Misery
[03:02.68]There's much more to life than what you see
[03:05.35]My friend of misery
[03:15.24]
[05:08.70]Misery
[05:10.43]You insist that the weight of the world
[05:13.53]Should be on your shoulders
[05:17.09]Misery
[05:18.50]There's much more to life than what you see
[05:21.53]My friend of misery
[05:27.46]
[05:31.57]You just stood there screaming
[05:37.58]
[05:39.02]My friend of misery
