[00:05.17]Lyrics to Lovely Head :
[00:09.07]
[00:20.46]Taken from album Feltmount
[00:25.84]
[00:34.60]Made by Chris Tian, China
[00:37.64]
[00:41.09]It starts in my belly
[00:45.28]Then up to my heart
[00:49.91]Into my mouth I can’t keep it shut
[00:58.82]Do you recognize the smell
[01:04.98]Is that how you tell
[01:10.28]Us apart
[01:17.72]
[01:51.77]I fool myself
[01:55.58]To sleep and dream
[01:58.59]Nobody’s there
[02:01.65]No-one but me
[02:08.75]So cool
[02:13.16]You’re hardly there
[02:16.31]Why can’t this be killing you
[02:27.03]
[03:05.39]Frankenstein would want your mind
[03:09.63]Your lovely head
[03:16.40]Your lovely head
[03:23.00]
