[00:18.04]Title:Never-ending Story
[00:20.74]
[00:21.85]Armies have conquered
[00:24.50]And fallen in the end
[00:27.06]Kingdoms have risen
[00:29.33]Then buried by sand
[00:32.67]The Earth is our mother
[00:34.61]She gives and she takes
[00:37.26]She puts us to sleep and
[00:39.70]In her light we'll awake
[00:42.62]We'll all be forgotten
[00:45.35]There's no endless fame
[00:48.16]But everything we do
[00:50.67]Is never in vain
[00:53.28]
[00:54.41]We're part of a story, part of a tale
[00:59.52]We're all on this journey
[01:02.54]No one is to stay
[01:05.21]Where ever it's going
[01:07.78]What is the way?
[01:13.69]
[01:19.60]Forests and deserts
[01:22.22]Rivers, blue seas
[01:24.82]Mountains and valleys
[01:27.28]Nothing here stays
[01:30.00]While we think we witness
[01:32.67]We are part of the scene
[01:35.15]This never-ending story
[01:37.72]Where will it lead to?
[01:40.44]The earth is our mother
[01:42.87]She gives and she takes
[01:45.45]But she is also a part
[01:48.54]A part of the tale
[01:52.80]We're part of a story, part of a tale
[01:57.66]We're all on this journey
[02:01.13]No one is to stay
[02:03.28]Where ever it's going
[02:05.76]What is the way?
[02:12.04]
[02:12.96]We're part of a story, part of a tale
[02:18.53]Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
[02:24.20]No one remembers how it began.
[02:32.53]
[02:55.07]We're part of a story, part of a tale
[03:00.95]We're all on this journey
[03:03.67]No one is to stay
[03:06.05]Where ever it's going
[03:09.14]What is the way?
[03:16.35]We're part of a story, part of a tale
[03:21.79]Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
[03:26.93]No one remembers how it began.
