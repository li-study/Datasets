[00:09.07]How can I just let you walk away, 
[00:12.03]just let you leave without a trace
[00:15.15]When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
[00:24.43]You're the only one who really knew me at all  
[00:29.71]
[00:32.79]How can you just walk away from me, 
[00:36.52]when all I can do is watch you leave
[00:40.76]Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain, 
[00:44.98]and even shared the tears
[00:48.70]You're the only one who really knew me at all 
[00:55.31]So take a look at me now, 
[01:00.17]'cos there's just an empty space
[01:04.57]And there's nothing left here to remind me, 
[01:09.17]just the memory of your face 
[01:12.51]Take a look at me now, 
[01:16.77]'cos there's just an empty space
[01:20.65]And you coming back to me is against all odds 
[01:25.30]and that's what I've got to face 
[01:30.56]
[01:36.32]I wish I could just make you turn around, 
[01:39.75]turn around and see me cry
[01:43.74]There's so much I need to say to you, 
[01:48.02]so many reasons why
[01:51.41]You're the only one who really knew me at all  
[01:58.69]So take a look at me now, 
[02:02.63]'cos there's just an empty space
[02:07.28]And there's nothing left here to remind me, 
[02:12.31]just the memory of your face 
[02:15.53]Take a look at me now, 
[02:19.67]'cos there's just an empty space
[02:23.48]But to wait for you, 
[02:26.56]well that's all I can do 
[02:29.79]and that's what I've got to face 
[02:31.92]Take a good look at me now, 
[02:35.81]'cos I'll still be standing here
[02:40.25]And you coming back to me is against all odds
[02:44.75]That's the chance I've got to take, oh, oho
