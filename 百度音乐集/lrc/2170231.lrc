[00:42.60]
[00:46.60]All the note books in the world
[00:48.51]could never hold the lives I hold
[00:50.86]But I've gotta make them real
[00:55.05]It's like covering a bird in solid steel
[00:59.83]all of these thought that I conceal
[01:03.15]Through shinning
[01:04.99]All the lights in this red world
[01:07.27]Can never hold the love I hold
[01:09.44]I'm throwing it away
[01:13.60]It's like swimming in oceans made of clay
[01:18.52]Swimming in circles round the bay
[01:21.90]So gladly
[01:23.57]Well feed me out to the lions
[01:29.93]My heart's a lion
[01:32.84]Feed me out to the lions
[01:39.46]well I make excuses pass the book
[01:42.06]I play the crowd but it's down to me not luck
[01:47.14]When the lights are on
[01:50.90]
[01:58.53]The dreaming clouds they're living in
[02:00.66]They try to hide their master fear
[02:02.99]But their tears they catch on fire
[02:07.08]And as they drop they dance with my desire
[02:12.16]Don't think a plane could get much higher
[02:13.95](plane could get much higher)
[02:15.01]Higher than I do
[02:17.04]Just on imagination, just on hope
[02:19.89]Just on the thought that you will someday have a face
[02:26.07]Give me a beat and real sound
[02:30.73]Maybe some feet will reach cold ground
[02:34.15]To find you
[02:35.76]Well feed me out to the lions
[02:42.11]If I say this one more time
[02:45.17]Feed me out to the lions
[02:51.96]I beg, I hope, I wish, I pray
[02:54.17]But that's not gonna send me on my way
[02:59.27]When the lights come on
[03:03.49]
