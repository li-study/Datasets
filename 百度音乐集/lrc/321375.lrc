[00:17.03]I've looked under chairs
[00:19.75]I've looked under tables
[00:22.26]I've tried to find the key
[00:24.83]To fifty million fables
[00:27.00]They call me The Seeker
[00:31.50]I've been searching low and high
[00:38.92]I won't get to get what I'm after
[00:42.14]Till the day I die
[00:50.00]I asked Bobby Dylan
[00:52.81]I asked The Beatles
[00:55.14]I asked Timothy Leary
[00:57.32]But he couldn't help me either
[00:59.79]They call me The Seeker
[01:02.42]I've been searching low and high
[01:11.13]I won't get to get what I'm after
[01:14.78]Till the day I die
[01:22.54]People tend to hate me
[01:25.01]'Cause I never smile
[01:27.52]As I ransack their homes
[01:29.14]They want to shake my hand
[01:33.24]Focusing on nowhere
[01:35.13]Investigating miles
[01:37.77]I'm a seeker
[01:38.96]I'm a really desperate man
[02:05.29]I won't get to get what I'm after
[02:07.91]Till the day I die
[02:15.55]I learned how to raise my voice in anger
[02:20.21]Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
[02:25.59]I'm happy when life's good
[02:28.04]And when it's bad I cry
[02:30.47]I've got values but I don't know how or why
[02:36.87]I'm looking for me
[02:38.01]You're looking for you
[02:41.23]We're looking in at other
[02:43.43]And we don't know what to do
[02:46.09]They call me The Seeker
[02:50.23]I've been searching low and high
[02:57.70]I won't get to get what I'm after
[02:59.85]Till the day I die
