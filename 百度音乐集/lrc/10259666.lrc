[00:43.77]Down this road
[00:46.08]Down this road once again
[00:52.57]And it feels like beneath
[00:57.13]the dust of time
[01:02.55]
[01:04.05]Down this road
[01:06.36]Down this road once again
[01:12.97]And it seems this will be till
[01:17.53]the end of my time
[01:24.27]
[01:25.58]Oh how I wish you were here
[01:30.51]to make the sighs of despair disappear
[01:35.81]Oh how I wish you could see
[01:40.43]in spite of it all what you mean to me
[01:45.49]Scars are made to remind
[01:50.43]
[01:51.93]Along this road
[01:54.92]Along this road once again
[02:01.47]still it seems like it leads nowhere but away
[02:11.21]
[02:13.08]Along this road
[02:15.32]Along this road once again
[02:21.88]still it seems that it has been always this way
[02:33.80]
[02:35.04]Oh how I wish you were here
[02:39.38]to make the sighs of despair disappear
[02:44.99]Oh how I wish you could see
[02:49.73]in spite of it all what you mean to me
[02:54.67]Scars are made to remind
[03:00.09]
[03:44.34]Oh how I wish you were here
[03:48.27]to make the sighs of despair disappear
[03:54.13]Oh how I wish you could see
[03:58.00]in spite of it all what you mean to me
[04:02.69]And oh how these years have been long
[04:08.37]while humming the notes of the dead man's song
[04:13.93]And oh how I wish they would fade
[04:18.86]all of them wounds
[04:21.29]I know it's too late
[04:26.28]
[04:44.50]Scars are made to remind
[04:49.49]Scars are made to remind
[04:54.49]Scars are made to remind
