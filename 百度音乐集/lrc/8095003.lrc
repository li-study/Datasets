[01:10.24]Open your eyes
[01:11.88]And turn off your mind
[01:13.86]Step right up folks and you will find
[01:17.54]Agrowing trend
[01:19.17]An epidemic
[01:21.04]Spread with zen

[01:45.13]Calculated, formulated
[01:47.06]Feed my head with simple thoughts
[01:49.22]And let me breathe instead of being taught
[01:50.42]All bottled up and tearing at the seams
[01:53.67]I'm bored
[01:54.05]Just let me breathe
[01:55.53]
[02:01.00]A daily dose of eMpTyV

[02:44.25]I'm bored
[02:44.67]Just let me breathe
[02:46.29]
[02:52.69]Strike up your best angst ridden posture
[03:00.77]Manufactured anger
[03:07.40]Let's not forget my legacy
[03:12.90]All my heroes have failed me
[03:16.18]Now they're dead and buried
[03:20.10]
[04:37.47]Just close your mind

[04:45.83]Until the fashion fades
[04:47.91]And the checks go through
[04:49.84]My bank roll's red and my face is blue
[04:53.21]And still they'll turn their backs on you for
[04:55.59]Someone new
[04:57.15]
[04:57.65]Feed my head
[04:58.96]With some real thoughts
[05:00.78]And let me think instead
[05:02.65]Of being taught
[05:04.54]I'll say things
[05:06.36]You won't believe
[05:08.35]Just stand back
[05:10.28]Just let me breathe.......
