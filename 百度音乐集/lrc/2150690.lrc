[00:10.20]This is what I see
[00:15.71]Is there anybody else
[00:17.60]That feels like me, yeah
[00:22.24]You sweat, you sweat
[00:24.01]You bleed, you bleed
[00:26.31]What you get ain't what you see
[00:29.78]Up is down and black is white to me

[00:50.94][01:57.07]It's alright
[00:53.01][01:59.11]It's OK

[01:14.82]I'm smart enough to know
[01:16.47]What I don't know
[01:22.18]I'm fool enough to stay
[01:23.76]When I should go
[01:28.46]You work, you work
[01:30.20]You cry, you cry
[01:32.37]You watch your whole life pass you by
[01:35.72]Sometimes you've got to close your eyes to see
