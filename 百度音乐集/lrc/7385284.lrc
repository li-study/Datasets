[00:05.89]
[00:27.60]Dust off that dusty photograph
[00:31.79]And think of how we laughed
[00:40.38]Roll up those shutters to your shop
[00:44.64]Cos now this circus got to stop
[00:50.46]
[00:53.61]Flick through those dog-eared magazines
[00:57.88]When you were in the scene
[01:04.30]But now that you're gone...
[01:05.90]
[01:07.49]There's never gonna be another
[01:10.78]Never gonna be another like you
[01:17.32]The people in the street are saying
[01:20.36]There's never gonna be another
[01:22.66]Woh... never gonna
[01:23.87]Never gonna be another like you
[01:26.83]
[01:32.21]I watched your soul when it was young
[01:36.71]You'd finished when you'd just begun
[01:43.65]I'd like to take a feather from
[01:48.90]The wings that used to carry you
[01:57.35]So suddenly, you seem at peace
[02:01.71]We know that you have been released
[02:07.63]
[02:10.33]Don't think they'll cry for you tomorrow
[02:14.54]They never cried for you that day
[02:19.16]But the people in the street are saying
[02:21.80]to me baby...
[02:22.81]
[02:24.15]There's never gonna be another
[02:27.56](There's never gonna be)
[02:28.83]Never gonna be another like you
[02:34.37](When you were on the scene)
[02:37.14]There's never gonna be another
[02:40.84](And now that you're gone)
[02:45.17]Never gonna be another like you
[02:51.46](Never gonna be... another like you)
[02:49.42]You stepped into the light and you
[02:53.23]are the sun now
[02:54.43]
[03:00.49]Now that you're gone, I think of you,
[04:00.32]
