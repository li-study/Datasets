[00:02.29]Nat King Cole - Nature Boy
[00:19.88]There was a boy
[00:24.31]A very strange enchanted boy
[00:28.66]They say he wandered very far, very far
[00:34.61]Over land and sea
[00:40.58]A little shy and sad of eye
[00:50.14]But very wise was he
[01:00.22]And then one day
[01:04.23]A magic day he passed my way
[01:09.28]And while we spoke of many things
[01:13.22]Fools and kings
[01:16.10]This he said to me
[01:22.55]The greatest thing youll ever learn
[01:31.59]Is just to love and be loved in return
