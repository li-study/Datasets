[00:00.49]Are we growing up or just going down
[00:04.78]it\'s just a matter of time until we\'re all found out
[00:08.21]Take our tears put them on ice
[00:10.75]Cause I swear I\'d burn this city down to show you the light
[00:12.03]We\'re the therapists pumping through your speakers
[00:20.21]Delivering just what you need
[00:22.08]We\'re well-read and poised
[00:25.90]We\'re the best boys
[00:28.80]We\'re the chemists who\'ve found the formula
[00:32.88]To make your heart swell and burst
[00:36.90]No matter what they say, don\'t believe a word
[00:43.03]Cause I\'ll keep singing this lie if you\'ll keep believing it
[00:51.00]I\'ll keep singing this lie

[01:15.80]We travel like gypsies
[01:20.00]Only with worse luck and far less gold
[01:23.00]We were the kids you used to love
[01:26.58]But then we grew old
[01:30.03]We\'re the lifers here till the bitter end
[01:34.02]Condemned from the start
[01:38.03]Ashamed of the way
[01:40.06]The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts
[01:45.00]Cause I\'ll keep singing this lie
[01:48.88]I\'ll keep singing this lie
[01:52.07]Are we growing up or just going down
[01:55.04]it\'s just a matter of time until we\'re all found out
[01:59.04]Take our tears put them on ice
[02:02.07]Cause I swear I\'d burn this city down to show you the light
[02:06.00]And there\'s a drug in the thernostat to warm the room up
[02:09.89]And there\'s another around to help us bend your trust
[02:13.20]Got a sunset in my veins
[02:17.00]And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay
[02:25.25]The best part of \"Believe\" is the \"Lie\"
[02:28.74]I hope you sing along and you steal a line
