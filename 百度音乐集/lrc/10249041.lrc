[00:18.37]Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
[00:26.66]Would you know me and see behind the smile
[00:35.33]I can change like colors on a wall
[00:42.27]Hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
[00:49.27]I think I hide it all so well
[00:53.82]
[00:54.50]Stepping out, everyone can see my face
[01:01.36]All the things I can't erase from my life
[01:05.97]Everybody knows
[01:11.08]Standing out so you won't forget my name
[01:17.92]That's the way we play this game of life
[01:22.49]Everybody knows
[01:28.02]
[01:28.13]Looking through the crowd
[01:31.87]I search for something else
[01:35.98]But every time I turn around
[01:39.99]I run into myself
[01:45.82]Here I stand
[01:48.42]Consumed with my surroundings
[01:52.44]Just another day
[01:56.61]Of everybody looking
[02:00.74]I swore they'd never see me cry
[02:04.85]You'll never see me cry
[02:06.92]
[02:09.00]Stepping out, everyone can see my face
[02:16.19]All the things I can't erase from my life
[02:22.72]Everybody knows
[02:25.63]Standing out so you won't forget my name
[02:32.53]That's the way we play this game of life
[02:37.16]Everybody knows
[02:40.03]
[02:43.42]You say I'll pay the price
[02:48.36]That's the chance that I'll take
[02:52.00]Though you may think I'm telling lies
[02:58.75]But I just call it getting by
[03:01.65]
[03:03.54]Stepping out, everyone can see my face
[03:09.79]All the things I can't erase from my life
[03:14.17]Everybody knows
[03:16.71]
[03:19.42]Standing out so you won't forget my name
[03:26.04]That's the way we play this game of life
[03:31.05]Everybody knows I am just barely getting by
