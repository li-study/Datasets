[00:22.57]I'm all alone in the rainfall
[00:27.97]I hear my name call
[00:31.91]I look up but there's no one around
[00:38.76]
[00:40.85]The sky is wild
[00:43.36]And the wind blows
[00:46.04]I'm out the window
[00:49.83]Trying to fly
[00:52.28]But I keep falling down
[00:57.82]
[01:01.79]I will never have that dream again
[01:08.84]If I do I'll just get up and then
[01:15.26]Sure as the sun will rise
[01:19.74]I'll be there by your side
[01:26.10]Till the end of time
[01:30.80]
[01:31.77]I live my life, where it takes me
[01:37.10]I'm what it makes me
[01:40.99]I get up but I keep falling down(keep falling down)
[01:52.87]
[01:53.52]The blinding light silhouettes me
[01:58.68]I try to get free
[02:02.64]So I run, but I keep falling down(keep falling down)
[02:13.38]
[02:14.47]I will never have that dream again
[02:21.60]If I do I'll just get up and then
[02:27.70]Sure as the sun will rise
[02:32.19]I'll be there by your side
[02:38.54]To the end of time
[02:44.14]
[02:44.39]And every night
[02:45.97]I close my eyes
[02:47.84]I hear the voices calling
[02:51.43]Don't try to hide
[02:53.36]Don't try to fight
[02:56.04]
[02:59.05]It's only sleep
[03:00.92]It's just a dream
[03:02.85]And you're not falling
[03:05.88]
[03:13.79]I live my life, where it takes me
[03:18.81]I'm what it makes me
[03:22.86]I get up but I keep falling down
[03:29.93](keep falling down)
[03:33.78]
[03:34.75]I will never have that dream again
[03:41.91]If I do I'll just get up and then
[03:47.93]Sure as the sun will rise
[03:52.61]I'll be there by your side
[03:58.86]To the end of time
[04:07.60]
[04:17.08]Sure as the sun will rise
[04:21.61]I'll be there by your side
[04:27.97]To the end of time
[04:32.81]
[04:33.61]And every night
[04:35.48]I close my eyes
[04:37.43]I hear the voices calling
[04:40.95]Don't try to hide
[04:42.87]Don't try to fight
[04:48.17]
[04:56.06][The End]
