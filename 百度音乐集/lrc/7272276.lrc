[00:05.42]Bleeding Wolves

[00:45.84]Here I stand in Bressanone
[00:52.22]with the stars up in the sky
[00:57.78]Are they shining over Brenner
[01:03.30]and upon the other side
[01:08.98]you would be a sweet surrender
[01:14.68]I must go the other way
[01:20.13]And my train will carry me onward
[01:25.95]though my heart would surely stay
[01:31.78]Wo my heart would surely stay
[01:37.87]
[02:33.29]Now the clouds are flying by me
[02:39.53]and the moon is on the rise
[02:45.29]I have left stars behind me
[02:51.10]they were disamondsin your skies
[02:59.27]You would be a sweet surrender
[03:04.82]I must go the other way
[03:10.27]And my train will carry me onward
[03:16.50]though my heart would surely stay
[03:21.49]Wo my heart would surely stay
