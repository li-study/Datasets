[00:24.12]I'll be coming home
[00:27.04]just to be alone
[00:35.69]Cause I know you're not there
[00:38.80]And I know you don't care
[00:47.17]I can hardly wait to leave this place
[00:50.19]No matter how hard I try
[00:56.82]You're never satisfied
[00:59.47]This is not a home
[01:02.12]I think I'm better off alone
[01:05.61]You always disappear
[01:09.32]Even when you're here
[01:11.40]This is not my home
[01:13.05]I think I'm better off alone
[01:16.24]Home, this house is not a home
[01:34.56]By the time you come home
[01:36.47]I'm already stoned
[01:45.13]You turn off the tv
[01:48.09]And you scream at me
[01:56.84]I can hardly wait
[01:59.41]till you get off my case
[02:02.71]No matter how hard I try
[02:05.94]You're never satisfied
[02:08.86]This is not a home
[02:10.70]I think I'm better off alone
[02:14.65]You always disappear
[02:17.58]Even when you're here
[02:20.42]This is not my home
[02:22.59]I think I'm better off alone
[02:25.65]Home, this house is not a home
[02:34.50]This house is not a home
[03:09.56]I'm better off alone
