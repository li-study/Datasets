[00:10.25]Taking a trip down memory lane
[00:14.65]Things have changed one thing remains
[00:18.99]That they will always have each other
[00:23.97]
[00:27.13]And even though those days have gone
[00:32.08]They know here is where they belong
[00:36.27]Theres some kind of magic in the air
[00:41.61]
[00:42.06]Feel the warmth
[00:46.27]that only summer breezes can bring
[00:50.51]Sweet little notes of spring begin
[00:58.30]Nothing to fear
[01:01.47]
[01:02.76]Taking one step at a time walking hand in hand
[01:08.01]1 2 3 4 Cheek to cheek
[01:11.63]And theyre learning how to do the dance
[01:16.73]Let this love be forevermore they say
[01:23.25]I wish for this to be true for you and me
[01:31.65]
[01:35.26]Holding her close he leading the way
[01:39.72]Out at the park enjoying the day
[01:44.05]And you can tell theyll be okay

[01:49.73]Feel the warmth
[01:54.00]that only summer breezes can bring
[01:58.22]Sweet little notes of spring begin
[02:05.85]Nothing to fear
