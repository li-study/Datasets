[00:00.48]Tristan Prettyman - Interviews
[00:11.64]
[00:33.62]Am I sick of giving the same answers
[00:35.80]Are you sick of asking the same questions
[00:38.85]If we go round and round repeating
[00:40.95]We ain't got no direction
[00:42.82]And this system falling apart
[00:45.04]I can't believe it all started
[00:47.07]At the heart of the matter of fact
[00:50.20]I'd put it all in, but I won't get it back
[00:52.47]And my love, my love
[00:54.70]The only thing that is stable
[00:57.45]When my time is all tied up
[00:59.17]But my heart is able
[01:02.04]So come on
[01:03.90]'Cause I won't let you down
[01:06.40]And when I come around
[01:08.87]Well I'll be good as new
[01:10.88]So don't give up on me so soon
[01:14.63]These interviews with who
[01:16.60]Can't tell the rumors from the truth
[01:18.24]Don't let it get the best of you
[01:21.12]And don't give up on me so soon
[01:33.27]Did the travel ever catch you in a hurry
[01:35.19]I can't believe I even began to worry
[01:37.23]In the big picture, we're all so small
[01:40.08]We get so caught up, forgetting that we fall
[01:42.91]Everything about it takes time to grow
[01:45.21]So just learn to be loose, and let it all go
[01:47.84]'Cause the time goes by, so damn fast
[01:50.10]We try to build it all up but is it ever gonna last
[01:53.53]And my love, my love
[01:54.70]The only thing that is stable
[01:57.30]When my time is all tied up
[01:59.39]But my heart is able
[02:02.07]So come on
[02:03.87]'Cause I won't let you down
[02:06.37]And when I come around
[02:08.81]Well I'll be good as new
[02:10.88]So don't give up on me so soon
[02:14.11]These interviews with who
[02:15.85]Can't tell the rumors from the truth
[02:18.28]Don't let it get the best of you
[02:21.91]And don't give up on me so soon...
