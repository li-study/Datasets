[00:20.55]all i can say
[00:22.32]is that my life is pretty plain
[00:26.19]i like watchin' the puddles
[00:28.68]gather rain
[00:32.99]and all I can do
[00:35.33]is just pour some tea for two
[00:38.92]and speak my point of view
[00:42.50]but it's not sane, its not sane
[00:49.38]i just want someone to say to me
[00:55.64]I'll always be there when you wake
[01:01.95]ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
[01:08.83]so stay with me and I'll have it made
[01:14.15]and I don't understand
[01:16.68]why I sleep all day
[01:19.93]and I start to complain
[01:22.75]that theres no rain
[01:27.21]and all I can do
[01:29.12]is read a book to stay awake
[01:33.19]it rips my life away
[01:35.48]but its a great escape...escape...escape
[02:16.04]and all I can say is that my life is pretty plain
[02:22.05]you don't like my point of view
[02:24.48]ya think that I'm insane
[02:28.60]it's not sane... its not sane
[02:35.87]i just want someone to say to me
[02:42.47]i'll always be there when you wake
[02:48.73]ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
[02:55.38]so stay with me and I'll have it made
