[00:00.07]Moon river, wider than a mile
[00:06.75]I'm crossing you in style some day
[00:17.15]Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
[00:25.63]Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
[00:35.48]Two drifters, off to see the world
[00:44.13]There's such a lot of world to see
[01:07.55]We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
[01:13.30]My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
[01:19.94] Moon River, and me
