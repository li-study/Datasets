[00:00.00]P.O.D - Satellite
[00:08.00]
[00:12.00]Satellite  Satellite
[00:24.00]I wonder how clear it must look from there to here
[00:28.00]No obstruction, this selfish corruption  All in this atmosphere
[00:31.00]No fear, less tears, only time to catch my breath
[00:34.00]I fail to inhale
[00:36.00]Your love constricts my chest
[00:37.50]Confusion blinded me, mental and physically
[00:39.00]And it's because of you that now I can see
[00:44.00]So now I can run. I follow the Son and ride on to Zion
[00:48.00]And dance this last song of freedom
[00:50.00]But only time will tell, if it's truly for real
[00:52.50]Can't change your mind, all I know this is what I feel
[00:56.00]Whether I'm wrong or right, please keep my life in sight
[00:59.50]And never take you eyes off me
[01:03.00]As I look up to the sky today
[01:06.50]Well I can see you looking down on me
[01:09.00]It brings a smile to my face again
[01:13.00]S-S-S-Satellite
[01:19.00]Satellite  Satellite
[01:26.00]It's truly one of a kind, like star shine, beyond night time, are you there
[01:29.00]My eyes stare to find, just what's behind this blind notion of mine, is it genuine
[01:35.00]Cause sometimes, it plays tricks with my mind, some call it asinine
[01:39.00]But it's like love or hate, now is that real or fake?
[01:42.00]Cause it's a real thin line, but that's your choice to make
[01:45.00]The question at hand, help me understand, is this your plan?
[01:48.00]I think I can, can I think, then I think I can
[01:51.00]Because I won't break (nah), and I won't shake (nah)
[01:55.00]With lifted hands to this Man (Jah), I'll stand in faith
[01:57.00]I'll make it through, my trust in you
[02:00.00]Close my eyes, make a wish, kiss the sky
[02:02.00]Hey there I see you
[02:16.00]Shining Light  Shining Light
[02:18.50]Blinding Light  Blinding Light
