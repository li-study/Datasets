[00:00.00]April come she will--simon & garfunkel
[00:10.10]
[00:12.10] April come she will
[00:19.91]When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
[00:25.75]May, she will stay,
[00:31.36]Resting in my arms again
[00:36.79]
[00:41.83]June, she′ll change her tune,
[00:49.85]In restless walks she′ll prowl the night;
[00:55.15]July, she will fly
[01:01.47]And give no warning to her flight.
[01:06.27]
[01:12.40]August, die she must,
[01:19.16]The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
[01:24.69]September I′ll remember.
[01:31.18]A love once new has now grown old.
