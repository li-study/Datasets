[00:00.60]Ray Charles with james taylor
[00:06.60]Sweet Potato Pie
[00:12.82]
[00:16.82]Oh Lord I feel fine today
[00:21.05]I'm walking on cloud nine today
[00:24.40]I'm over that line today
[00:27.23]Happiness is finally mine today
[00:31.57]I guess I'm just a lucky guy
[00:35.28]And I'm prepared to tell you why
[00:39.17]It's strictly on account of my
[00:42.20]Sweet Potato Pie
[00:46.54]
[01:00.89]I'm the fellow that she loves the most
[01:04.36]The main reason why she left the coast
[01:08.04]She's my little girlzi?a
[01:11.41]So much hotter that a jalape?o
[01:16.12]Tender like a night in June
[01:19.83]Sweeter than a honeymoon
[01:23.60]Brighter than a silver spoon
[01:26.31]Just as crazy as a loon
[01:30.62]Softer than a lullabye
[01:34.17]Deeper than the midnight sky
[01:37.81]Soulful as a baby's cry
[01:41.37]My Sweet Potato Pie
[01:45.11]
[02:29.14]I used to see her around the neighborhood
[02:32.84]I wonder how she grew up so good
[02:36.30]She belonged to Freddy and he was bad
[02:39.33]And I never was ready to make him mad
[02:44.33]I'm glad I had to wait awhile
[02:47.99]A little bit too juvenile
[02:51.83]I needed to refine my style
[02:54.84]A silk suit and a crocodile smile
[02:59.17]So let the whole damn world go by
[03:02.64]'Cause I just want to testify
[03:06.50]From now on it's me and my
[03:09.68]Sweet Potato Pie
