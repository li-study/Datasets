[00:-2.00]Il Divo - Amazing Grace
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.40]
[00:00.64]Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
[00:11.90]That saved a wretch like me.
[00:22.59]I once was lost but now am found,
[00:33.72]Was blind, but now I see.
[00:43.81]
[00:45.11]T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
[00:55.53]And Grace, my fears relieved.
[01:05.61]How precious did that Grace appear
[01:16.00]The hour I first believed.
[01:25.14]
[01:26.74]Through many dangers, toils and snares
[01:37.01]I have already come;
[01:47.34]'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
[01:57.62]and Grace will lead me home.
[02:07.10]
[02:54.57]When we've been here ten thousand years
[03:04.68]Bright shining as the sun.
[03:14.57]We've no less days to sing God's praise
[03:24.80]Than when we've first begun.
[03:37.94]
[03:40.83]Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
[03:51.95]That saved a wretch like me.
[04:02.67]I once was lost but now am found,
[04:13.83]Was blind, but now I see.
