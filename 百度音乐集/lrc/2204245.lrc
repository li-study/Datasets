[00:12.50]
[00:18.85]Well, I'd go house to house
[00:20.79]And knock on every door
[00:25.23]I'd take down all the walls
[00:27.14]And tear up every floor
[00:31.75]Just to figure out, oh
[00:33.66]What we're fighting for
[00:38.63]And all I can do is sit
[00:44.02]And let the air speak for you
[00:50.95]
[00:51.08]'Cause when words meet heartbeats
[00:53.94]Baby, come on
[00:55.93]You know it's not even fair
[00:57.64]And a first-round knockdown
[01:00.41]Baby, the floor
[01:02.37]You know I'm already there
[01:04.26]And the sun sets high and that moon is low
[01:10.28]Cause when words meet heartbeats
[01:13.25]Baby, you'll know
[01:14.45]
[01:26.23]Well, there's silence now
[01:27.88]There's nothing more to gain
[01:32.59]And it isn't right if I can't run away
[01:38.79]Because it kills the mood
[01:42.34]When there's nothing left to say
[01:45.56]And all I can do is sit
[01:51.18]And let the air speak for you
[01:57.49]
[01:58.20]'Cause when words meet heartbeats
[02:01.15]Baby, come on
[02:03.13]You know it's not even fair
[02:04.98]And a first-round knockdown
[02:07.60]Baby, the floor
[02:09.46]You know I'm already there
[02:11.28]And the sun sets high and that moon is low
[02:17.19]Oh, 'cause when words meet heartbeats
[02:20.13]
[02:20.54]And I'm not too tired
[02:22.40]I'm not too tired to know what you're doing
[02:27.10]And I'm not too tired
[02:28.95]I'm not too tired to sing
[02:33.61]And I'm not too tired
[02:35.53]I'm not too tired to know what you're doing with me
[02:41.57]
[02:46.33]'Cause when words meet heartbeats
[02:49.16]Baby, come on
[02:51.01]You know it's not even fair
[02:52.97]And a first-round knockdown
[02:55.57]Baby, the floor
[02:57.48]You know I'm already there
[02:59.24]And the sun sets high and that moon is low
[03:05.20]Oh, 'cause when words meet heartbeats
[03:08.70]Oh, when words meet heartbeats
[03:11.87]Oh, when words meet heartbeats
[03:14.81]Baby, you'll know
[03:15.95]
[03:16.50]The End
