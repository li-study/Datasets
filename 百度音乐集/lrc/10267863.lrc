[00:18.15]Georgia, Georgia
[00:26.20]The whole day through
[00:32.79]Just an old sweet song
[02:32.07][02:17.35][00:38.17]Keeps Georgia on my mind
[00:44.84]On my mind
[00:48.81]I said, Georgia, oh Georgia
[00:59.82]A song of you
[01:05.55]Comes as sweet and clear
[01:11.79]As moonlight through the pines
[01:23.52]Other arms reach out to me
[01:31.67]Other eyes smile tenderly
[01:39.47]Still in peaceful dreams I see
[01:47.58]The road leads back to you
[01:52.97]Oh, Georgia, I say oh, Georgia
[02:04.28]No, no, no peace I find
[02:10.12]Just an old sweet song, oh sweet song
[02:26.31]Oh just an old sweet song
[02:54.22]There'll always be Georgia
