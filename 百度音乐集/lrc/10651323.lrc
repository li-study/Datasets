[00:21.14]Some might say, love is like, fairytale
[00:31.90]But I say, love can be, hurtful still, oooh
[00:43.20]Cos we are, all human,
[00:48.48]we all make mistake and never regret
[00:53.89]We know we won't be together is just a matter of time
[01:01.41]Just a matter of time
[01:05.97]
[01:06.37]We never speak with all the truth from heart
[01:11.70]We made it wrony and we broke it from start
[01:16.51]No matter how we tried and tried
[01:21.81]Ever though we cried and cried and cried
[01:27.87]
[01:28.18]We'll never fix the wound that's lying inside
[01:33.46]We might as well just let it die and say goodbye
[01:41.25]Maybe one day we'll realise
[01:46.73]The reasons hiding behind
[01:51.60]
[01:59.44]Some might say,love is like,fairytale
