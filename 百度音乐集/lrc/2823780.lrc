[00:02.38]Broken Wings-Alter Bridge
[00:14.14]
[00:42.30]Fight the fight alone
[00:45.77]When the world is full of victims
[00:49.46]Dims a fading light
[00:52.27]In our souls
[00:54.75]
[00:56.33]Leave the peace alone
[00:59.63]How we all are slowly changing
[01:03.20]Dims a fading light
[01:05.97]In our souls
[01:07.68]
[01:10.12]In my opinion seeing is to know
[01:17.03]The things we hold
[01:18.65]Are always purge to go
[01:24.06]And who's to say
[01:25.56]We won't end up alone
[01:29.07]
[03:53.51][02:58.81][01:29.35]On broken wings I'm falling
[03:56.52][03:01.78][01:32.26]And it won't be long
[04:00.27][03:05.81][01:36.06]The skin on me is burning
[04:03.44][03:08.77][01:39.08]By the fires of the sun
[04:07.10][03:12.59][01:42.84]On skinned knees
[04:08.97][03:15.13][01:44.60]I'm bleeding
[04:10.42][03:16.52][01:46.34]And it won't be long
[04:14.02][03:20.30][01:50.05]I've got to find that meaning
[04:17.07][03:23.50][01:53.33]I'll search for so long
[03:27.00][01:56.70]
[02:12.70]Cry ourselves to sleep
[02:16.09]We will sleep alone forever
[02:19.64]Will you lay me down
[02:22.56]In the same place with all I love
[02:26.13]
[02:26.69]Mend the broken homes
[02:29.97]Care for them they are our brothers
[02:33.52]Save the fading light in our souls
[02:38.64]
[02:40.47]In my opinion seeing is to know
[02:47.55]What you give
[02:48.98]Will always carry you
[02:54.31]And who's to say
[02:55.93]We won't survive it too
[02:59.17]
[03:28.91]Set a-free all
[03:32.25]Relying on their will
[03:34.80]To make me all that I am
[03:38.17]And all that I'll be
[03:40.37]
[03:42.61]Set a-free all
[03:45.98]Will fall between the cracks
[03:49.01]With memories of all that I am
[03:52.54]And all that I'll be
