[00:02.60]Remember The Name
[00:04.13]Fort Minor
[00:05.56]
[00:06.94]You ready? Let's go!
[00:12.29]
[00:15.35]Yeah, for those of you that
[00:19.47]want to know what we're all about
[00:21.27]It's like this y'all (c'mon!)

[00:28.49]Five percent pleasure
[00:29.69]Fifty percent pain
[00:30.82]And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
[00:33.86]Mike<Mike>
[00:34.94]He doesn't need his name up in lights
[00:36.31]He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
[00:39.30]He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
[00:42.34]In spite of the fact that some people
[00:44.46]still think that they know him
[00:45.16]But fuck em'
[00:46.14]He knows the code
[00:47.15]It's not about the salary
[00:48.25]It's all about reality and makin' some noise
[00:50.63]Makin' the story
[00:51.85]Makin' sure his clique stays up
[00:53.49]That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up(Let's go!)
[00:56.23]
[00:56.82]Who the hell is he anyway?
[00:58.16]He never really talks much
[00:59.68]Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
[01:02.19]Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
[01:05.00]That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps
[01:08.10]Put it together himself, now the picture connects
[01:10.48]Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
[01:13.06]He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
[01:16.52]And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
[01:18.81]
[01:19.42]This is twenty percent skill
[01:20.63]Eighty percent fear
[01:21.72]Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
[01:24.52]Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
[01:27.69]And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method,Name Of The Game
[01:30.34]Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
[01:33.05]I like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?
[01:35.94]This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
[01:39.27]His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!
[01:41.41]
[01:41.81]This is ten percent luck
[01:43.34]Twenty percent skill
[01:44.78]Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
[01:47.26]Five percent pleasure
[01:49.02]Fifty percent pain
[01:50.34]And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
[01:52.59]
[01:52.95]They call him Ryu, he’s sick
[01:54.29]And he’s spittin fire with Mike
[01:55.76]Got him out the dryer he's hot
[01:57.04]Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
[01:58.49]What a fuckin’ nihilist porcupine
[02:00.27]He's a prick, he's a cock
[02:01.35]The type women want to be with
[02:02.99]And rappers hope he get shot
[02:04.43]Eight years in the makin'
[02:05.74]Patiently waitin to blow
[02:07.19]Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
[02:09.86]He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope
[02:12.20]You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
[02:15.92]
[02:16.14]Tak
[02:17.14]He's not your everyday on the block
[02:18.35]He knows how to work with what he's got
[02:20.09]Makin' his way to the top
[02:21.32]He often gets a comment on his name
[02:22.94]People keep askin him was it given at birth
[02:25.35]Or does it stand for an acronym?
[02:26.97]No, he's livin' proof
[02:28.50]Got him rockin' the booth
[02:29.54]He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
[02:32.67]Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
[02:35.45]Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent
[02:37.84]
[02:38.44]Forget Mike
[02:39.07]Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
[02:42.16]It seems like he's never got time
[02:43.81]Because he writes every note and he writes every line
[02:46.54]And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
[02:49.27]It’s like a design is written in his head every time
[02:52.05]Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
[02:54.95]And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
[02:58.31]Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
[03:00.54]
[03:00.98]This is ten percent luck
[03:02.24]Twenty percent skill
[03:03.62]Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
[03:06.65]Five percent pleasure
[03:08.12]Fifty percent pain
[03:09.40]And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
[03:11.94]
[03:12.39]This is ten percent luck
[03:13.68]Twenty percent skill
[03:15.13]Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
[03:17.94]Five percent pleasure
[03:19.13]Fifty percent pain
