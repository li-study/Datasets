[00:02.24]Force Of Nature
[00:03.17]Lenka
[00:04.12]
[00:20.93]You move a little closer
[00:25.54]You feel the force of nature
[00:29.92]We touch and something charges
[00:34.17]The air you look into my eyes
[00:41.25]And you can't look away
[00:45.52]It's no surprise
[00:49.75]I planned it out this way
[00:53.50]And now I know
[00:54.95]Ah, a-whoo
[00:59.61]You're completely bewitched
[01:01.95]Caught under my spell
[01:03.63]Ah, a-whoo
[01:08.43]Completely bewitched
[01:10.52]Your body will tell you what to do
[01:13.95]
[01:14.62]It's sorcery the way
[01:18.47]I draw you to me
[01:21.24]So don't try to struggle
[01:25.76]You are captured in my web
[01:32.55]Just like a voodoo doll
[01:36.95]I make you move
[01:41.17]'Cause I know what I like and I like you
[01:46.35]Ah, a-whoo
[01:51.05]You're completely bewitched
[01:53.43]Caught under my spell
[01:54.98]Ah, a-whoo
[01:59.82]Completely bewitched
[02:01.98]Your body will tell you what to do
[02:03.50]Ah, a-whoo
[02:08.22]You're completely bewitched
[02:10.55]Caught under my spell
[02:12.07]Ah, a-whoo
[02:17.13]Completely bewitched
[02:19.06]Your body will tell you what to do
[02:22.82]
[02:22.96]Now close your eyes
[02:25.16]And surrender to the moment
[02:30.51]Reach out your hand and touch me
[02:34.81]I am your gravity
[02:40.76]
[02:48.54]Ah, a-whoo
[02:53.20]You're completely bewitched
[02:55.57]Caught under my spell
[02:57.14]Ah, a-whoo
[03:01.96]Completely bewitched
[03:04.10]Your body will tell you what to do
[03:05.58]Ah, a-whoo
[03:10.36]You're completely bewitched
[03:12.68]Caught under my spell
[03:14.20]Ah, a-whoo
[03:19.11]Completely bewitched
[03:21.23]Your body will tell you what to do
[03:25.18]
