[00:20.98]I got home late on a Saturday night
[00:25.22]And I knew right away something wasn't right
[00:30.25]I knew she was gone
[00:35.90]She took all I had, but left a hole in my heart
[00:41.08]Should've known it'd go bad right from the start
[00:46.74]What did I do wrong
[00:52.45]I can't understand why she would leave me this way
[00:57.18]With nothing to say
[01:00.58]Then I found the note on the door
[01:04.24]It said good-bye and she don't want me no more
[01:07.45]Chorus:
[01:07.75]Bye-bye baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
[01:14.08]And that was all she wrote
[01:16.67]Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
[01:21.52]And that was all she wrote
[01:26.30]
[01:33.53]I called on the phone but she wasn't there
[01:37.36]Should've known all along that she just didn't care
[01:41.42]Why did she have to go
[01:47.98]Now I look at her picture and I wonder why
[01:52.27]She left me this way - why did she say good-bye
[01:57.86]I guess I'll never know
[02:04.04]I can't understand why she would leave me this way
[02:08.40]With nothing to say
[02:11.94]I remember the note on the door
[02:15.75]It said good-bye and she don't want me no more
[02:19.05]Chorus
[02:19.34]Bye-bye baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
[02:25.47]And that was all she wrote
[02:28.05]Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
[02:33.49]And that was all she wrote
[02:38.28]<solo>
[03:23.01]Bye-bye baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
[03:29.01]And that was all she wrote
[03:31.44]Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
[03:37.28]And that was all she wrote
[03:39.31]baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
[03:44.78]And that was all she wrote
[03:47.30]Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
[03:53.04]And that was all she wrote
[03:57.21]
[03:59.27]All she wrote!
[04:01.82]Baby bye-bye!
[04:11.11]Bye-bye baby, bye-bye!
[04:14.96]
[04:18.52]<The End>
