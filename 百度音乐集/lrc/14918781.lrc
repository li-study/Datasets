[00:15.00]Shiver
[00:17.68]You build me up
[00:18.57]You knock me down
[00:20.33]Provoke a smile
[00:21.44]And make me frown
[00:23.28]You are the queen of runaround
[00:25.63]You know it's true
[00:28.81]You chew me up
[00:29.82]And spit me out
[00:31.53]Enjoy the taste
[00:32.47]I leave in your mouth
[00:34.34]You look at me
[00:35.19]I look at you
[00:36.88]Neither of us know what to do
[00:39.70]There may not
[00:41.45]Be another way to your heart
[00:44.29]So I guess I'd better find a new way in
[00:49.66]I shiver when I hear your name
[00:52.70]Think about you but it's not the same
[00:55.34]I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin
[01:07.62]Immobilized by the thought of you
[01:10.77]Paralyzed by the sight of you
[01:13.60]Hypnotized by the words you say
[01:16.24]Not true but I believe em anyway
[01:19.08]So come to bed It's getting late
[01:21.85]There's no more time for us to waste
[01:24.58]Remember how my body tastes
[01:27.13]You feel your heart begin to race
[01:30.59]There may not
[01:32.20]Be another way to your heart
[01:35.05]So I guess I'd better find a new way in
[01:40.75]I shiver when I hear your name
[01:43.41]Think about you but it's not the same
[01:46.21]I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
[02:15.11]There may not
[02:16.79]Be another way to your heart
[02:19.65]So I guess I'd better find a new way in
[02:25.37]I shiver when I hear your name
[02:27.97]Think about you but it's not the same
[02:30.69]I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
