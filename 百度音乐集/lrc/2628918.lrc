[00:28.00]When the world is darker than I can understand
[00:35.00]When nothing turns out the way I planned
[00:42.00]When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
[00:49.00]When I can't sleep through the lonely night
[00:54.00][01:01.00][01:15.00][01:50.00][01:56.00][02:10.00][03:01.00][03:09.00][03:23.00][03:29.00][03:37.00][03:51.00][03:58.00]I turn to you
[00:57.00][01:52.00][03:05.00]Like a flower leaning toward the sun
[01:04.00][01:59.00][03:12.00][03:40.00]'Cos you're the only one
[01:08.00][02:03.00][03:16.00][03:43.00]Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
[02:50.00][01:20.00][02:16.00]
[01:24.00]When my insides are wracked with anxiety
[01:31.00]You have the touch that will quiet me
[01:37.00]You lift my spirit,you melt the ice
[01:44.00]When I need inspiration, when I need advice
[02:20.00]Where would I be?
[02:23.00]What would I do?
[02:26.00]If you'd never helped me through
[02:34.00]I hope someday if you've lost your way
[02:39.00]You could turn to me like I turn to you
[03:33.00]When fear tells me to turn around
