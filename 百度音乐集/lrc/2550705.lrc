[00:04.47]she believes in me
[00:05.17]kenny rogers
[00:05.83]
[00:12.11]while she lays sleeping
[00:17.22]i stay out late at night and play my songs
[00:23.48]and sometimes all the nights can be so long
[00:30.23]and it's good when i finally make it home
[00:36.27]all alone
[00:40.07]while she lays dreaming
[00:44.05]i try to get undressed without the light
[00:50.57]and quietly she says how was your night
[00:57.29]and i come to her and say
[01:00.64]it was all right
[01:04.45]and i hold her tight
[01:06.50]chorus
[01:09.80]and she believes in me
[01:15.20]i'll never know just what she sees in me
[01:20.98]i told her someday if she was my girl
[01:27.03]i could change the world
[01:30.42]with my little songs
[01:33.44]i was wrong
[01:35.97]but she has faith in me
[01:40.85]and so i go on trying faithfully
[01:47.45]and who knows maybe on some special night
[01:52.16]if my song is right
[01:56.00]i will find a way
[02:00.22]find a way...
[02:02.81]while she lays waiting
[02:06.72]i stumble to the kitchen for a bite
[02:13.02]then i see my old guitar in the night
[02:19.37]just waiting for me like a secret friend
[02:26.22]and there's no end
[02:29.93]while she lays crying
[02:33.61]i fumble with a melody or two
[02:40.48]and i'm torn between the things that i should do
[02:46.54]and she says to wake her up when i am through
[02:52.97]god her love is true.
[02:56.44]chorus
[02:58.65]and she believes in me
[03:04.24]i'll never know just what she sees in me
[03:09.74]i told her someday if she was my girl
[03:15.98]i could change the world
[03:19.22]with my little songs
[03:22.52]i was wrong
[03:24.91]but she has faith in me
[03:30.28]and so i go on trying faithfully
[03:36.49]and who knows maybe on some special night
[03:41.55]if my song is right
[03:45.26]i will find a way
[03:51.76]while she waits...
[03:58.16]while she waits for me
[04:04.03]
[04:09.51]End
