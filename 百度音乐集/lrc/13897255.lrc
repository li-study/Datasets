[00:25.08]I wake up every morning, bright and early
[00:28.04]Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
[00:31.06]Tension is pulling me in all directions
[00:33.52]And all of these problems use me as their own
[00:37.08]Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy
[00:39.48]At any time I could explode
[00:42.92]I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired
[00:45.51]Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road
[00:48.80]
[00:49.13]I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
[00:55.84]We all need a moment in our live
[01:02.80]Works hard, the days too long
[01:05.65]And that's just where it begins
[01:09.58]Tension has had us all this time
[01:15.04]
[01:16.60]I sit in traffic every single morning
[01:18.93]Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
[01:22.53]Making the money so I feed my family
[01:24.93]But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
[01:28.45]I got no free days on my busy schedule
[01:30.97]I turn the page and it's the same
[01:34.39]Don't like my situation, you don't either
[01:36.93]Don't wanna look back scared, I'm working life away
[01:40.26]
[01:40.57]I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
[01:47.31]We all need a moment in our live
[01:54.26]Works hard, the days too long
[01:56.88]And that's just where it begins
[02:01.10]Tension has had us all this time
[02:06.53]
[02:22.98]But every now and then
[02:27.12]I drive alone
[02:30.45]An open road
[02:33.72]Hot summer days
[02:36.66]A gentle breeze that feels alright
[02:42.69]Home alone
[02:45.20]And I can't feel the pain
[02:49.59]Only strength
[02:52.55]Enjoy the sights
[02:55.85]I feel alive
[02:58.89]When actually here just feels alright
[03:04.99]Far from home
[03:07.88]
[03:39.14]I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
[03:45.89]We all need a moment in our live
[03:52.72]Works hard, the days too long
[03:55.34]And that's just where it begins
[03:59.55]Tension has had us all this time
[04:06.01]
