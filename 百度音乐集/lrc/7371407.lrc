[00:02.67]On Your Own
[00:03.22]
[00:36.94]Holy man tiptoed his way across the ganges
[00:42.64]The sound of magic music in his ears
[00:48.13]Videoed by a bus load of tourists
[00:53.76]Shiny shellsuits on, and drinking lemonade.
[00:58.87]
[00:59.37]Now, Ive got a funny feeling which I bought mail order
[01:05.08]From a man in a tee-pee, california.
[01:10.92]He said he once was the great game show performer
[01:16.55]Then he blew all his money away,
[01:22.05]Blew it all away.
[01:24.21]
[01:24.87]So take me home, dont leave me alone
[01:27.66]Im not that good, but Im not that bad
[01:30.48]No psycho killer, hooligan geurilla
[01:33.22]I dream to riot, oh you should try it
[01:36.15]R. e. perot, get gold card soul
[01:38.85]My joy of life is on a roll
[01:41.75]And well all be the same in the end
[01:47.62]Cos then youre on your own
[01:53.50]Then youre on your own
[01:59.89]
[02:05.27]Well, we all go happy day glow in the disco
[02:10.75]The sound of magic music in our brains
[02:16.15]Someone stumbles to the bathroom with the horrors
[02:22.04]Says lord, give me time, for Ive jumped into space
[02:27.42]Im in outer space.
[02:29.77]
[02:30.48]So take me home, dont leave me alone
[02:33.09]Im not that good, but Im not that bad
[02:35.90]No psycho killer, hooligan geurilla
[02:38.74]I dream to riot, oh you should try it
[02:41.67]R. e. perot, get gold card soul
[02:44.49]My joy of life is on a roll
[02:47.31]And well all be the same in the end
[02:53.03]Cos then youre on your own
[03:07.72]
[03:18.72]So take me home, dont leave me alone
[03:21.35]Im not that good, but Im not that bad
[03:24.19]No psycho killer, hooligan geurilla
[03:27.12]I dream to riot, oh you should try it
[03:29.97]R. e. perot, get gold card soul
[03:33.06]My joy of life is on a roll
[03:36.21]And well all be the same in the end
[03:41.55]Cos then youre on your own
[03:47.25]Then youre on your own
