[00:22.42]歌手独白
[00:25.36]
[00:35.72]I didn't mean it
[00:36.64]When I said I didn't love you so
[00:39.09]I should have held on tight
[00:40.91]I never should've let you go
[00:42.51]I did nothing  I was stupid
[00:44.25]I was foolish
[00:45.44]I was lying to myself
[00:49.39]I could not fathom that I would ever
[00:51.65]Be without your love
[00:52.94]Never imagined I'd be
[00:54.14]Sitting here beside myself
[00:56.14]I didn't know you  I didn't know me
[00:57.87]But I thought I knew everything
[00:59.31]I never felt
[01:03.11]The feeling that I'm feeling now
[01:04.82]Now that I don't  Hear your voice
[01:06.62]Or even touch or even kiss your lips
[01:08.37]Cause I don't have a choice
[01:09.93]Or even touch orget get by my side 
[01:13.08]right here  Cause baby 
[01:16.26]When you left  I lost a part of me
[01:20.67]It's still so hard to believe
[01:24.04]Come back baby please
[01:26.35]cause  We belong together
[01:29.29]Who else am I gonna lean on
[01:31.01]When times get rough
[01:32.80]Who's gonna talk to me
[01:33.95]Till the sun comes up
[01:36.19]Who's gonna take your place
[01:37.45]Baby nobody else  We belong together
[01:43.87]I can't sleep at night
[01:45.54]When you're all on my mind
[01:47.21]Bobby Womack's on the radio
[01:49.29]Singing to me
[01:50.74]If you think you're lonely now
[01:53.22]Wait a minute
[01:53.98]This is too deep, too deep
[01:55.88]I gotta change the station
[01:56.91]So I turn the dial
[01:59.06]Trying to catch a break
[02:00.55]And then I hear Babyface
[02:03.09]I only think of you
[02:05.88]And it's breaking my heart
[02:07.38]I'm trying to keep it together
[02:09.07]But I'm falling apart
[02:10.77]I'm feeling all out of my element
[02:13.10]I'm throwing things
[02:13.95]Crying  Trying to figure out
[02:14.96]Where the hell I went wrong
[02:17.08]The pain reflected in this song
[02:18.60]Ain't even half of what
[02:19.89]I'm feeling inside  I need you
[02:21.58]Need you back in my life baby
[02:25.01]When you left  I lost a part of me
[02:29.31]It's still so hard to believe
[02:32.68]Come back baby please
[02:34.84]cause  We belong together
[02:38.01]Who else am I gonna lean on
[02:39.63]When times get rough
[02:41.29]Who's gonna talk to me
[02:42.41]Till the sun comes up
[02:44.74]Who's gonna take your place
[02:45.97]There ain't nobody else
