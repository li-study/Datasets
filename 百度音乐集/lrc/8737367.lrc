[00:26.21]After we go to sleep
[00:32.70]Our sun rise
[00:36.17]I will make it the truth of painfully
[00:42.30]Helping me cover up things
[00:48.17]I wish I never had found
[00:55.21]
[01:18.53]Confident
[01:21.79]Tangled up in a nice life
[01:28.24]Put the spider in you
[01:31.62]Watching in
[01:34.67]Disregard
[01:38.02]You live a nice life
[01:41.22]With the spider in you
[01:44.68]I saved myself
[01:50.23]For someone somewhere's sweet caress
[01:55.98]Something goes wrong
[02:01.58]And all I sought was happiness
[02:09.09]
[02:22.07]Confident
[02:25.39]Tangled up in a nice life
[02:31.91]Put the spider in you
[02:35.24]Watching in
[02:38.42]Disregard
[02:41.77]You live a nice life
[02:45.09]With the spider in you
[02:55.87]
[03:12.85]I saved myself
[03:18.52]For someone somewhere's sweet caress
[03:24.24]Something goes wrong
[03:30.02]And all I sought was happiness
[03:35.76]And so
[03:38.92]In right wing fashion
[03:43.00]We'll nurture xenophobia
[03:48.82]And be strong
[03:52.13]In right wing fashion
[03:55.98]With paste and generosity
[04:01.97]Because no one is safe
[04:09.03]From someone somewhere's sweet embrace
[04:14.80]And so I have simply
[04:22.07]Decided to dislike you now
[04:29.82]
[04:32.93]End
