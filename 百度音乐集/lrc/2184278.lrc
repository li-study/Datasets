[00:05.59]Take it away. Take it away.
[00:11.62]Take away these feelings cuz they're bringing me down.
[00:19.70]Cuz I can't breathe. Feels like I can't breathe.
[00:25.60]Feels just like this whole world's coming down on me.
[02:00.98][00:35.88]Oh, can I be forgiven for all I have done?
[00:49.15]Can you set me free? Can you set me free?
[00:55.09]Set me free from all this pain life's done to me.
[02:30.84][01:05.20]If you can hear me praying,
[02:35.80][01:10.77]then I'll ask one more time.
[02:53.85][02:41.52][01:29.44][01:17.31]Can you take it away, Lord?
[02:47.50][01:23.02]Oh, can I be forgiven?
[02:59.24][01:34.27]Help me change my ways of living.
[02:13.79]Is there time for me? Is there still time for me?
[02:20.19]Time to change whatever I've got left of me.
[03:04.65]Echale.
