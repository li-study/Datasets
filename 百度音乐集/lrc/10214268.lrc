[00:03.02]"Hard To Say"
[00:06.23]
[00:18.67]The singer finished singing and she's walking out
[00:22.40]The singer sheds a tear, her fear of falling out
[00:33.22]And it's hard to say how I feel today
[00:38.03]For years gone by and I cried
[00:45.03]
[00:45.61]It's hard to say that I was wrong
[00:51.06]It's hard to say I miss you
[00:54.72]Since you've been gone, it's not the same
[00:58.72]
[00:59.09]My worries weigh the world, how I used to be
[01:08.38]And everything, I'm cold, seems a plague in me
[01:17.36]And it's hard to say how I feel today
[01:22.25]For years gone by and I cried
[01:29.91]
[01:31.55]It's hard to say that I was wrong
[01:35.09]It's hard to say I miss you
[01:39.24]Since you've been gone, it's not the same
[01:43.07]It's hard to say I held my tongue
[01:47.00]It's hard to say if only
[01:51.32]Since you've been gone, it's not the same
[01:55.64]
[01:59.85]Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before
[02:07.03]Worse than a fear it's the knife
[02:14.69]And it's hard to say how I feel today
[02:18.52]For years gone by and I cried
[02:25.00]
[02:27.26]It's hard to say that I was wrong
[02:31.00]It's hard to say I miss you
[02:34.89]Since you've been gone, it's not the same
[02:38.99]It's hard to say I held my tongue
[02:42.92]It's hard to say if only
[02:46.90]Since you've been gone, I'm not the same
[02:51.38]It's hard to say (God, it's hard to say)
[02:55.04]Since you've been gone,
[03:01.93]I'm not the same
