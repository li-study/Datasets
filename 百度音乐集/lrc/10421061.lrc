[00:12.29]Once I was a prisoner
[00:22.20]Lost inside myself
[00:30.01]With the world surrounding me
[00:35.96]Wandering through the misery
[00:42.40]But now I am free
[00:48.37](Mhhhhhhhhh)
[00:53.16]You gave me a breath of life
[01:03.17]Unclouded my eyes
[01:10.82]With a sweet serenity
[01:17.01]Lighting a ray of hope for me
[01:23.45]And now I am free
[01:31.49](Oooooooooh)
[01:33.12]Free to live
[01:35.66]Free to laugh
[01:37.77]Free to soar
[01:40.31]Free to shine
[01:42.88]Free to give
[01:45.25]Free to love
[01:49.30]Free enough to fly
[01:55.41]Oooooh
[01:56.64]Once I was all so alone
[02:06.65]Unsteady and cold
[02:13.91]But your love rained down upon me
[02:20.39]Washing away uncertainty
[02:27.89]But now
[02:30.23](Now)
[02:37.65](I)
[02:46.76]I am free
[02:56.69]I am free
