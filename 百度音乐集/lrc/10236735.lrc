[02:02.70]It's the choice,
[02:09.36]to stay.
[02:14.90]It's a dream,
[02:20.39]And I wanna wake.
[02:22.66]
[02:26.87]You have blood on your hands,
[02:32.27]And I'm feeling faint.
[02:39.66]And honey,
[02:44.35]You can't decide.
[02:46.81]
[02:50.83]I'm a drug,
[02:55.61]You don't want to give up;
[03:02.86]Smoke your cigarettes,
[03:08.68]And make your love.
[03:11.17]
[03:14.32]You poured blood in my heart,
[03:20.22]And I can't get enough.
[03:27.14]I'm drowning, drowning,
[03:32.05]And you can't decide.
[03:35.86]
[03:38.14]It's not about geography or happenstance,
[03:42.54]You need to fly and take a chance.
[03:45.03]You don't need to soar to emptiness,
[03:48.17]Float on high and forever dance alone.
[03:52.10]
[03:56.17]You're scared, scared, scared,
[04:01.68]'Cause I feel like home.

[05:22.64]
[05:24.51]Hear your voice,
[05:29.54]And knew right away.
[05:36.04]If you were here,
[05:41.57]Your eyes would say
[05:44.06]
[05:48.34]There is blood on my feet,
[05:53.64]As I'm walking away.
[06:00.94]The rivers are red,
[06:05.46]It's starting to rain.
[06:09.11]
[06:11.36]I'm not gonna live for you,
[06:14.49]Or die for you,
[06:15.72]Or do anything anymore for you,
[06:18.44]'Cause you leave me here on the other side,
[06:21.61]Won't you leave me here on the other side.
[06:24.33]Won't live for you,
[06:25.93]And die for you,
[06:27.31]Won't do anything anymore for you,
[06:29.94]'Cause you leave me here on the other side,
[06:32.77]Don't you leave me here on the other side.
[06:35.52]Won't live for you.
[06:37.41]Or die for you.
[06:38.93]Won't do anything anymore for you.
[06:41.48]'Cause you leave me here on the other side,
[06:44.34]Don't you leave me here on the other side.
[06:46.88]Not gonna live for you,
[06:48.79]Or die for you,
[06:50.25]Or do anything anymore for you,
[06:52.78]Won't you leave me here on the other side.
[06:55.78]'Cause you leave me here on the other side.
[06:58.81]Not gonna live for you,
[07:01.06]Die for you,
[07:04.48]Anything,
[07:04.91]Not gonna shed one more tear for you,
[07:11.06]
[07:16.63]Shed one more tear for you,
[07:22.58]I'm not gonna shed one more tear for you,
[07:25.93]At least not til Sunday Afternoon.
[07:34.75]Sunday Afternoon.
