[00:02.48]warrant
[00:04.33]heaven
[00:07.56]Got a picture of your house
[00:10.82]And you're standing by the door
[00:14.24]It's black and white and faded
[00:17.32]And it's looking pretty worn
[00:20.18]See the factory that I worked
[00:23.99]Silhouetted in the back
[00:27.75]The memories are grey
[00:29.88]but man they're really coming back
[00:33.38]I don't need to be the king of the world
[00:40.59]As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
[00:46.70]
[00:48.99]Heaven isn't too far away
[00:55.38]Closer to it every day
[01:01.85]No matter what your friends might say
[01:05.88]
[01:08.00]How I love the way you move
[01:11.51]And the sparkle in your eyes
[01:14.53]There's a color deep inside them
[01:18.53]Like a blue suburban sky
[01:20.42]
[01:21.17]When I come home late at night
[01:24.86]And you're in bed asleep
[01:28.27]I wrap my arms around you
[01:31.41]So I can feel you breathe
[01:33.89]
[01:34.63]I don't need to be a superman
[01:41.47]As long as you will always be my biggest fan
[01:47.86]
[01:49.98]Heaven isn't too far away
[01:56.17]Closer to it every day
[02:02.79]No matter what your friends might say
[02:08.19]We'll find a way (Yeah!)
[02:12.87]
[02:35.34]Now the lights are going out
[02:38.91]Along the boulevard
[02:42.40]The memories come rushing back
[02:45.53]And it makes it pretty hard
[02:47.42]
[02:48.44]I've got nowhere left to go
[02:52.15]And no one really cares
[02:55.39]I don't know what to do
[02:58.66]But I'm never giving up on you
[03:02.39]
[03:03.21](Heaven isn't too far away)
[03:08.57]Closer to it every day
[03:15.11]No matter what your friends say
[03:18.53]I know we gotta find a way
[03:21.26]
[03:21.89]It's not too far away.
[03:36.43]It's not too far away.
[03:41.70]
[03:50.30]Yeah!
