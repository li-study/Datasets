[00:13.10]Would you like the chance to shatter heaven?
[00:20.13]Would you like to be the one
[00:23.12]who pulls the sky down just for me?
[00:27.22]Round and round and round we run
[00:31.32]and pretend the sun is all you need
[00:37.42]
[00:42.02]I've never known a moment to be frozen
[00:49.18]You're making deals with minutes
[00:51.92]that will slip away, just slip away
[00:56.71]So starve the garden stop the rain
[01:00.50]Winter settles on my petals anyways anyways
[01:11.33]
[01:12.32]Is your armor thin again
[01:16.30]Do I want to wear it down?
[01:20.10]Am I worthy to come in?
[01:23.83]Do you want to be found?
[01:28.44]
[01:34.60]Nothing into something into nothing
[01:40.69]Every rule you break means
[01:44.05]there's no turning back, no looking back.
[01:48.53]The words that I could never say
[01:52.20]The clutter that is in your way
[01:55.77]is nothing new..nothing new

[02:26.50]Am I worthy to come in?
[02:30.36]Do you want to be found
[02:33.20]
[02:33.66]Wandering between the girl
[02:36.54]you search for and the one you leave
[02:40.03]And I cannot wait..
[02:44.23]
[02:49.39]Chasing you around the room is tempting
[02:56.61]So near and far away from meaning anything to you
[03:05.07]But just remember if you're jumping
[03:09.43]I would start my jump off
[03:12.47]Running after you..
