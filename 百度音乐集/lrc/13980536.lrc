[00:-0.01]

[00:01.44]Look at this photograph
[00:04.44]Every time I do it makes me laugh
[00:07.54]How did our eyes get so red
[00:10.74]And what the hell is on Joey\'s head?
[00:13.27]
[00:14.47]This is where I grew up
[00:17.27]I think the present owner fixed it up
[00:20.52]I never knew we ever went without
[00:23.83]The second floor is hard for sneakin\' out
[00:26.30]
[00:27.54]And this is where I went to school
[00:30.33]Most of the time had better things to do
[00:33.56]Criminal record says I broke in twice
[00:36.89]I must\'ve done it half a dozen times
[00:39.44]
[00:40.59]I wonder if it\'s too late
[00:43.33]Should I go back and try to graduate?
[00:46.62]Life\'s better now than it was back then
[00:49.99]If I was them I wouldn\'t let me in
[00:53.78]Oh, oh, oh...
[00:56.60]Oh, God I...
[00:58.54]Every memory of lookin\' out the back door
[01:01.59]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[01:04.98]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[01:09.04]Goodbye, goodbye
[01:11.74]Every memory of walkin\' out the front door
[01:14.66]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin\' for
[01:17.99]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[01:21.89]Goodbye, goodbye
[01:25.07]
[01:39.46]Remember the old arcade?
[01:42.28]Blew every dollar that we ever made
[01:45.56]The cops hated us hangin\' out
[01:48.86]They said somebody went and burned it down
[01:51.68]
[01:52.20]We used to listen to the radio
[01:55.41]And sing along with every song we know
[01:58.68]We said someday we\'d find out how it feels
[02:01.96]To sing to more than just the steering wheel
[02:04.73]
[02:05.64]Kim\'s the first girl I kissed
[02:08.52]I was so nervous that I nearly missed
[02:11.70]She\'s had a couple of kids since then
[02:15.01]I haven\'t seen her since God knows when
[02:18.71]Oh, oh, oh...
[02:20.91]Oh, God I...
[02:23.55]Every memory of lookin\' out the back door
[02:26.56]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[02:30.03]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[02:33.90]Goodbye, goodbye
[02:36.75]Every memory of walkin\' out the front door
[02:39.62]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin\' for
[02:43.05]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[02:47.00]Goodbye, goodbye
[02:50.09]
[02:57.20]I miss that town, I miss the faces
[03:04.32]You can\'t erase, you can\'t replace it
[03:10.77]I miss it now, I can\'t believe it
[03:17.23]So hard to stay, too hard to leave it
[03:23.77]
[03:24.42]If I could relive those days
[03:27.10]I know the one thing that would never change
[03:29.96]
[03:32.22]Every memory of lookin\' out the back door
[03:35.27]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[03:38.74]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[03:42.62]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:45.43]Every memory of walkin\' out the front door
[03:48.30]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin\' for
[03:51.70]It\'s hard to say it, time to say it
[03:55.70]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:58.99]
[04:00.45]Look at this photograph
[04:03.24]Every time I do it makes me laugh
[04:06.53]Every time I do it makes me...
