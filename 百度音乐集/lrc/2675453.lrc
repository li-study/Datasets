[00:00.00]Eminem - I Love You More
[00:01.32]
[Intro]
[00:02.32]You still love me?
[00:04.85]Take this. [2 guns cock]
[00:08.24]You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! [2 shots]
[00:13.36]
[Chorus]
[00:13.76]The more you, put me through,
[00:15.96]The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
[00:18.43]You say you hate me, I just love you more,
[00:21.16]You don't want me, I just want you more,
[00:23.71]I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
[00:26.12]I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
[00:28.70]The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
[00:31.35]Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
[Verse 1]
[00:34.09]It's sick, but who could ever predict,
[00:35.93]We'd be doin' the same shit,
[00:37.24]We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
[00:39.71]We do it for us, it's lust,
[00:41.19]Cuz neither one of us trusts each other,
[00:42.88]So we fuck 'til we bust,
[00:44.16]Then we cuss each other, out,
[00:45.48]We know what it's about,
[00:46.95]Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
[00:48.72]You throw me out the house,
[00:50.20]I throw you on the couch,
[00:51.52]Punch you in the mouth,
[00:52.80]Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
[00:54.54]And apologize after,
[00:55.81]Laughter, pain, it's insane,
[00:57.56]We're back in the same chapter again,
[00:59.58]And it's sad but it's true,
[01:00.91]When I'm layin' here with you,
[01:02.11]There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.
[Chorus]
[01:04.76]The more you, put me through,
[01:07.16]The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
[01:09.76]You say you hate me, I just love you more,
[01:12.34]You don't want me, I just want you more,
[01:14.84]I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
[01:17.33]I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
[01:20.04]The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
[01:22.57]Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
[Verse 2]
[01:25.29]Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
[01:27.99]Good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
[01:30.64]It makes me wanna just take you,
[01:32.23]And just throw you on the bed,
[01:33.68]And fuck you like I don't even know you,
[01:35.65]You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
[01:37.95]You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
[01:39.95]We're both evil in our ways,
[01:41.23]But neither one of us would ever admit it,
[01:43.21]Cuz one of us would have one up on the other,
[01:45.08]So forget it,
[01:45.65]We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
[01:48.31]But they ain't got proof,
[01:49.42]'Til they do it's just the two of us,
[01:50.87]It's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
[01:53.47]But you gotta believe me to a degree,
[01:55.42]Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
[01:58.41]Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good,
[02:00.41]If I ran who would I run to,
[02:02.27]That would be this soft and warm,
[02:03.58]So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
[02:06.13]But at least we know that we share this common bond,
[02:08.74]You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
[02:11.25]I hope, the only reason that I cope,
[02:13.35]Is cuz of that fact,
[02:14.50]And plus I can bust in that,
[02:15.98]And that's why...
[Chorus]
[02:16.68]The more you, put me through,
[02:19.02]The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
[02:21.40]You say you hate me, I just love you more,
[02:24.10]You don't want me, I just want you more,
[02:26.58]I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
[02:28.96]I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
[02:31.69]The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
[02:34.15]Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
[Verse 3]
[02:36.90]I could never understand it,
[02:38.15]That's why I don't try,
[02:39.41]From junior high until we both die,
[02:41.46]It's silly ho why must we try,
[02:43.21]Is it really so rough,
[02:44.64]That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
[02:47.13]Try to pull each other's legs,
[02:48.56]Until the other begs,
[02:49.83]We're liein' to ourselves,
[02:50.96]That's the beauty of it yeah,
[02:52.37]Cuz we truly love each other,
[02:53.66]That's why we always fight,
[02:54.86]And all we do is shove each other,
[02:56.16]Every other fuckin' night,
[02:57.44]And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
[02:58.95]It's pent up rage,
[02:59.99]We both have,
[03:00.87]We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
[03:03.18]We've both been,
[03:04.20]Someone else's someone else,
[03:05.77]Problem is neither one wants help,
[03:07.58]It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
[03:09.76]Our family's mixed up,
[03:11.04]There's a baby sister in the mix,
[03:12.71]And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
[03:15.33]And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
[03:17.78]And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
[03:20.45]On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
[03:23.06]All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
[03:25.39]What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
[03:28.11]But I won't be made a fool of,
[03:29.74]If this is true love,
[03:30.71]You wouldn't do what,
[03:31.65]You did last time,
[03:32.59]You wouldn't screw up,
[03:33.61]This time,
[03:34.15]Cuz this time girl,
[03:35.17]I'm tellin you what,
[03:36.18]You do it again I'm fuckin you up,
[03:38.05]No matter what...
[Bridge]
[03:38.83]What you say, what you do,
[03:41.06]I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
[03:43.29]No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
[03:45.99]Right behind you, in your nightmares,
[03:48.27]All the flowers, and the candy,
[03:50.99]All the times that you threw it back at me,
[03:53.57]You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more,
[03:56.27]When you find out, can't escape me whore.
[Chorus]
[03:59.10]The more you, put me through,
[04:01.52]The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
[04:03.93]You say you hate me, I just love you more,
[04:06.58]You don't want me, I just want you more,
[04:09.03]I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
[04:11.51]I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
[04:14.18]The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
[04:16.57]Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
[04:20.01]
