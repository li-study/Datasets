[00:28.00]Here I lie
[00:30.00]in a lost and lonely part of town
[00:36.00]Held in time
[00:38.00]In a world of tears I slowly drown
[00:44.00]Goin'home
[00:46.00]I just can't make it all alone
[02:26.00][00:50.00]I really should be holding you
[02:30.00][00:54.00]Holding you
[00:56.00]Loving you loving you
[04:10.00][03:36.00][02:41.00][01:06.00]When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
[04:28.00][04:12.00][03:54.00][03:38.00][02:59.00][02:43.00][01:24.00][01:08.00]It's tragedy

[04:33.00][04:16.00][03:58.00][03:42.00][03:03.00][02:47.00][01:28.00][01:12.00]It's hard to bear
[04:18.00][03:44.00][02:49.00][01:14.00]With no-one to love you you're
[04:38.00][04:20.00][04:02.00][03:46.00][03:08.00][02:52.00][01:32.00][01:16.00]goin' nowhere
[04:26.00][03:52.00][02:58.00][01:22.00]When you lose control and you got no soul
[04:35.00][04:00.00][03:05.00][01:30.00]With no-one beside you you're
[02:04.00]Night and day
[02:06.00]there's a burning down inside of me
[02:10.00]Burning love
[02:14.00]With a yearning that won't let me be
[02:20.00]Down I go
[02:22.00]and I just can't take it all alone
[02:32.00]Loving you loving
[04:59.00][04:44.00]Tragedy etc.
