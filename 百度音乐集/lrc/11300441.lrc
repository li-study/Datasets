[00:06.00]
[00:30.07]The first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
[00:36.15]And I knew that to you and into your life I had to get
[00:42.08]I felt light-headed at the touch of this stranger's hand
[00:48.17]An assault my defences systematically failed to withstand
[00:52.76]
[00:53.53]'Cos you came at a time
[00:55.93]When the pursuit of one true love in which to fall
[01:01.67]Was the be all and end all
[01:04.62]Love is only a feeling
[01:08.34](Drifting away)
[01:10.50]When I'm in your arms I start believing
[01:14.48](It's here to stay)
[01:15.95]But love is only a feeling
[01:21.02]Anyway
[01:23.25]
[01:39.95]The state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
[01:45.73]I had seen, I had touched, I had tasted and I truly believed
[01:50.14]
[01:51.23]That the light of my life
[01:53.31]Would tear a hole right through each cloud that scudded by
[01:59.23]Just to beam on you and I
[02:02.09]Love is only a feeling
[02:05.81](Drifting away)
[02:07.91]When I'm in your arms I start believing
[02:11.88](It's here to stay)
[02:13.77]But love is only a feeling
[02:18.46]Anyway, anyway
[02:26.69]
[02:44.33]Love is only a feeling
[02:48.11](Drifting away)
[02:50.20]And we've got to stop ourselves believing
[02:54.26](It's here to stay)
[02:56.06]'Cos love is only a feeling
[03:00.80]Anyway.
