[00:02.66]Madonna
[00:04.70]
[00:16.91]When the world starts to get you down
[00:20.82]And nothing seems to go your way
[00:24.60]And the noise of the maddening crowd
[00:28.27]Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
[00:32.01]There's a glow of a distant light
[00:36.26]Calling you to come outside
[00:39.96]To feel the wind on your face and your skin
[00:43.23]And it's here I begin my story
[00:47.79]Turn up the radio
[00:51.48]Turn up the radio
[00:55.10]Don't ask me where I wanna go
[00:58.42]We gotta turn up the radio
[01:02.19]It was time that I opened my eyes
[01:06.43]I'm leaving the past behind
[01:10.28]Nothing's ever what it seems
[01:13.97]Including this time and this crazy scene
[01:17.75]I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
[01:21.50]I'm so tired of playing this game
[01:25.30]I don't know how I got to this state
[01:28.56]Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

[01:59.73]We gotta turn up the radio
[02:03.19]I just wanna get in my car
[02:06.99]I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
[02:10.74]Don't ask me to explain how I feel
[02:13.88]'Cause I don't want to say where I'm going
[02:16.73]Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
[02:20.27]Don't have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
[02:23.88]Leaving this place is the last thing I do
[02:27.01]That I want to escape with a person just like you
[02:35.19]I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
[02:39.00]We gotta have fun it it's all that we do
[02:42.28]Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
[02:46.30]Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow
[02:54.42]Turn up the radio
[02:58.11]Turn up the radio
[03:01.77]Don't ask me where I wanna go
[03:05.03]We gotta turn up the radio
[03:09.43]Turn up the radio
[03:13.21]Turn up the radio
[03:16.85]There's somethings you don't need to know
[03:20.36]Just let me turn up the radio
[03:22.70]Turn up the radio
[03:25.68]Just let me turn up the radio
[03:29.39]Just let me turn up the radio
[03:32.64]
