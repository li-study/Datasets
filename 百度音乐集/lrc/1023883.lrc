[00:07.54]Just like the white winged dove...

[00:28.21]Like a strand in the wind...
[00:30.39]In the web that is my own...
[00:32.61]I begin again
[00:34.58]Said to my friend, baby...
[00:38.06]Nothin' else mattered
[00:39.99]
[00:43.24]He was no more... than a baby then
[00:52.05]Well he... seemed broken hearted...
[00:55.77]Something within him
[01:00.28]But the moment... that I first laid...
[01:05.48]Eyes... on... him... all alone...
[01:09.45]On the edge of... seventeen

[01:39.52]Tomorrow
[01:43.88]And the music there it was hauntingly...
[01:48.52]Familiar
[01:51.74]When I see you doing...
[01:54.70]What I try to do for me
[01:57.06]With the words from a poet...
[01:59.20]And the voice from a choir
[02:01.08]And a melody... nothing else mattered

[02:26.88]
[02:26.96]The clouds... never expect it...
[02:30.54]When it rains
[02:32.55]But the sea changes colours...
[02:37.31]But the sea...
[02:39.34]Does not change
[02:41.72]And so... with the slow... graceful flow...
[02:43.45]And so... with the slow... graceful flow...
[02:50.84]Of age
[02:52.39]I went forth... with an age old...
[02:57.40]Desire... to please

[03:45.83]There was no one... left standing
[03:48.47]In the hall... yeah yeah...
[03:52.44]In a flood of tears
[03:54.28]That no one really ever heard fall at all
[04:00.62]I went searchin' for an answer...
[04:02.75]Up the stairs... and down the hall
[04:05.37]Not to find an answer...
[04:07.42]Just to hear the call
[04:09.14]Of a nightbird... singing...
