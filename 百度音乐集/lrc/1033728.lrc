[00:00.73]Life For Rent
[00:01.32]Dido

[00:11.53]I haven't really ever found a place that I call home
[00:17.78]I never stick around quite long enough to make it
[00:22.80]I apologize that once again I'm not in love
[00:28.17]But it's not as if I mind
[00:29.44]that your heart ain't exactly breaking
[00:34.08]It's just a thought, only a thought
[00:40.01]But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
[00:51.01]Well I deserve nothing more than I get
[00:57.37]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[01:03.86]I've always thought
[01:04.80]that I would love to live by the sea
[01:09.59]To travel the world alone
[01:11.57]and live my life more simply
[01:14.92]I have no idea what's happened to that dream
[01:20.87]Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me
[01:26.19]It's just a thought, only a thought
[01:32.02]But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
[01:43.13]Well I deserve nothing more than I get
[01:49.34]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[01:53.57]
[01:55.32]But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
[02:06.43]Well I deserve nothing more than I get
[02:12.53]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[02:16.68]
[02:18.50]While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
[02:29.20]While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
[02:40.75]Well how can I say I'm alive
[02:47.22]If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
[02:58.37]Well I deserve nothing more than I get
[03:04.54]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[03:10.25]If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
[03:21.47]Well I deserve nothing more than I get
[03:27.61]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[03:33.49]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
[03:39.07]Cos nothing I have is truly mine
