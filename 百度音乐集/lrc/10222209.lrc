[00:14.32]On the way to the bidet
[00:18.02]Is when the trouble used to start
[00:21.38]It didn't mean she wasn't queen
[00:25.18]Of the tinderbox that was his heart
[00:28.82]
[00:29.90]Her fire his desire meant that
[00:32.09]Everything must come undone
[00:35.84]And so now we know it's not enough to be in love
[00:44.04]
[00:50.18]He's so true. she is too. she says
[00:54.12]I love you Frank and then they drank
[00:57.85]All night. what a fight.
[01:01.65]He says it isn't me you're thinking of
[01:05.07]
[01:05.50]She's cool. it makes him cruel
[01:07.51]And they needle till the jewels
[01:10.79]Go raining down upon the ground
[01:13.15]She says its not enough to be in love
[01:19.97]
[01:26.89]Not enough to be in love
[01:40.14]Not enough to be in love
[01:40.60]
[01:41.13]They woke up, and they broke up.
[01:44.48]They were volatile, and all the while
[01:47.51]Life passed, it went so fast,
[01:51.66]And yet they never could forget,
[01:55.18]
[01:55.68]Their chemistry, like you and me
[01:58.20]Proved to keep them both apart for life
[02:01.85]And so, now we know
[02:06.33]That it's not enough to be in love
[02:10.61]Not enough to be in love
[02:12.80]Not enough To be in love
[02:14.04]Not enough To be in love
[02:15.09]
[02:21.08]Not enough To be in love
