[00:00.00]Bill Withers - Lovely Day
[00:05.65]
[00:20.89]When I wake up in the morning, love
[00:25.78]And the sunlight hurts my eyes
[00:30.73]And something without warning, love
[00:35.56]Bears heavy on my mind
[00:38.42]
[00:39.62]Then I look at you
[00:43.19]And the world's alright with me
[00:49.28]Just one look at you
[00:52.93]And I know it's gonna be
[00:58.07]A lovely day~
[01:00.37]Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
[01:07.98]A lovely day~
[01:10.16]Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
[01:18.72]
[01:19.59]When the day that lies ahead of me
[01:24.30]Seems impossible to face
[01:29.41]When someone else instead of me
[01:33.96]Always seems to know the way
[01:37.08]
[01:38.25]Then I look at you
[01:41.65]And the world's alright with me
[01:48.20]Just one look at you
[01:51.52]And I know it's gonna be
[01:56.80]A lovely day~
[01:59.23]Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
[02:06.66]A lovely day~
[02:08.95]Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
[02:17.38]
[02:18.30]When the day that lies ahead of me
[02:22.73]Seems impossible to face
[02:27.89]When someone else instead of me
[02:32.34]Always seems to know the way
[02:35.20]
[02:36.98]Then I look at you
[02:40.45]And the world's alright with me
[02:46.25]Just one look at you
[02:50.75]And I know it's gonna be
[02:55.61]A lovely day~
[02:58.99]Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...
[03:05.46]A lovely day~
