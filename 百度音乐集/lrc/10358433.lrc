[00:11.45]Drink up, baby, stay up all night
[00:15.69]The things you could do, you won't but you might
[00:20.77]The potential you'll be that you'll never see
[00:26.26]The promises you'll only make
[00:31.19]Drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days
[00:39.44]Do what i say and i'll make you okay and drive them away
[00:47.21]The images stuck in your head
[00:52.51]People you've been before that you don't want around anymore
[01:02.73]That push and shove and won't bend to your will
[01:09.72]I'll keep them still
[01:14.38]Drink up, baby, look at the stars, i'll kiss you again
[01:21.61]Between the bars where i'm seeing you
[01:26.56]There with your hands in the air waiting to finally be caught
[01:34.05]Drink up one more time and i'll make you mine
[01:40.29]Keep you apart deep in my heart separate from the rest
[01:47.87]Where i like you the best
[01:50.92]And keep the things you forgot
[01:56.32]The people you've been before that you don't want around anymore
[02:06.70]That push and shove and won't bend to your will
[02:13.68]I'll keep them still
