[00:00.00]And there's no easy way out to flee the pain
[00:07.06]Still hold a place for you in my heart
[00:14.58]I'll go somewhere on my own
[00:17.28]Just somewhere I belong
[00:20.67]Somewhere out there for me
[00:24.61]
[00:27.28]Farewell

[00:35.05]I sometimes felt that my life was a misery
[00:41.14]I couldn't find my place here ending my destiny
[00:47.96]Don't say a word, don't try to step me
[00:54.06]So do you realize that I am already damned
[01:08.91]
[01:20.47]Towards the land of far away
[01:24.50]Lighting up the sky
[01:28.79]There's nothing here to celebrate
[01:32.79]Silence's reigning in the wild
[01:35.79]
[01:36.35]So I am a vagabond riding the universe
[01:40.75]Diving into eternity
[01:44.34]I am biding you farewell
[01:47.92]Cause I will never back again
[01:51.18]
[01:51.46]And if the night belongs to lovers
[01:54.84]The twilight belongs to me
[01:58.11]I carry on all alone but my soul still remains
[02:04.43]Singing loud to save my honour
[02:08.51]Delivery is near
[02:11.99]Passing through the stars forever we are free
[02:21.64]
[02:21.98]And there's no easy way out to flee the pain
[02:28.58]Still hold a place for you in my heart
[02:34.40]I'll go somewhere on my own
[02:39.59]Just somewhere I belong
[02:42.66]Somewhere out the for me

[04:15.70]Still hold a place for you in my heart

[04:26.55]Just somewhere I belong
[04:33.84]Somewhere out there for me
