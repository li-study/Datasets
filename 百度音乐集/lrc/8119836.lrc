[00:06.00]
[00:11.65]Tonight you're mine completely
[00:22.35]You give your love so sweetly
[00:31.64]Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
[00:44.08]But will you love me tomorrow
[00:52.51]
[00:54.32]Is this a lasting treasure
[01:04.94]Or just a moment's pleasure
[01:14.19]Can I believe the magic of your sighs
[01:26.05]Will you still love me tomorrow
[01:34.61]
[01:36.62]Tonight with words unspoken
[01:47.19]You say that I'm the only one
[01:57.78]But will my heart be broken
[02:06.79]When the night meets the morning sun
[02:16.13]
[02:18.94]I'd like to know that your love
[02:29.65]Is love I can be sure of
[02:39.13]So tell me now, and I won't ask again
[02:50.82]Will you still love me tomorrow
[03:01.44]Will you still love me tomorrow
[03:11.99]Will you still love me tomorrow
[03:22.51]Will you still love me tomorrow
