[00:16.51]I don't konw where to find you
[00:24.06]I don't know how to reach you
[00:31.53]I hear your voice in the wind
[00:39.12]I feel you under my skin
[00:46.54]Within my heart and my soul
[00:52.88]I wait for you
[00:56.18]Adagio
[01:02.55]
[01:05.36]All of these nights without you
[01:12.73]All of my dreams surround you
[01:20.14]I see and I touch your face
[01:27.45]I fall into your embrace
[01:34.94]When the time is right I know
[01:40.83]You'll be in my arms
[01:44.12]Adagio
[01:49.58]
[01:50.01]I close my eyes and I find a way
[01:54.52]No need for me to pray
[01:58.42]I've walked so far
[02:02.05]I've fought so hard
[02:05.80]Nothing more to explain
[02:09.40]I know all that remains
[02:13.20]Is a piano that plays
[02:16.52]
[02:19.18]If you know where to find me
[02:26.54]If you know how to reach me
[02:33.90]Before this light fades away
[02:41.34]Before I run out of faith
[02:48.81]Be the only man to say
[02:54.51]That you'll hear my heart
[02:57.93]That you'll give your life
[03:01.46]Forever you'll stay
[03:09.92]
[03:25.59]Don't let this light fade away
[03:33.53]Don't let me run out of faith
[03:40.39]Be the only man to say
[03:45.99]That you believe,make me believe
[03:53.04]You won't let go
[04:01.20]Adagio
