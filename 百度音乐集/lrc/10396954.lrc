[00:01.00]Days Go By
[00:03.18]keith urban
[00:06.01]
[00:26.40]I'm changing lanes
[00:27.43]I'm talking on the phone
[00:29.18]I'm drivin' way to fast
[00:32.58]And the interstate's jammed with
[00:34.41]Gunners like me afraid of coming in last
[00:40.74]But somewhere in the race we run
[00:44.35]We're coming undone
[00:46.35]Days go by
[00:49.51]I can feel 'em flying
[00:50.91]Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
[00:55.83]It's all we've been given
[00:58.59]So you better start livin' right now
[01:01.67]'Cause days go by (Out on the roof)
[01:09.24]Out on the roof just the other night
[01:11.83]I watched the world flash by
[01:16.80]Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
[01:24.73]But somewhere in the rush I felt
[01:28.60]We're losing ourselves
[01:30.65]Days go by
[01:32.49]I can feel 'em flying
[01:34.28]Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
[01:39.95]It's all we've been given
[01:42.32]So you better start livin' right now
[01:45.22]'Cause days go by (Out on the roof)
[01:52.81]'Cause days go by (Out on the roof)
[02:00.87]We think about tomorrow then it slips away (Oh, yesterday)
[02:08.15]We talk about forever but we've only got today
[02:16.01]And the days go by
[02:18.53]I can feel 'em flying
[02:20.54]Like a hand out the window
[02:22.12]As the cars go by
[02:25.54]It's all we've been given
[02:27.34]So you better start livin'
[02:29.41]You better start livin'
[02:31.08]Better start livin' right now
[02:33.58]Cause days go by
[02:35.73]I can feel like 'em flying
[02:38.04]Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
[02:43.22]It's all we've been given
[02:45.87]So you better start livin' right now
[02:48.59]'Cause days go by (Out on the roof)
[02:55.43]These days go by (Out on the roof)
[03:04.53]So take 'em by the hand
[03:06.41]They're yours and mine
[03:08.20]Take 'em by the hand
[03:09.86]And live your life
[03:11.55]Take 'em by the hand
[03:13.48]Don't let 'em all fly by
[03:16.26]Come on, Come on now...
[03:28.97]Don't you know the days go by
[03:38.24]
