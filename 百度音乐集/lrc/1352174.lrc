[00:16.00]Girl, it's been a long, long time comin'
[00:30.00]But I, I know that it's been worth the wait
[00:43.00]It feels like springtime in winter
[00:52.00]It feels like Christmas in June
[00:59.00]It feels like heaven has opened up
[01:06.00]its gates for me and you
[01:10.00][02:44.00][03:59.00]And every time I close my eyes

[01:34.00][03:07.00][04:24.00]That someone like you loves me too, yeah
