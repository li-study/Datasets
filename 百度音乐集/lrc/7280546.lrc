[00:00.33]We've Only Just Begun
[00:12.10]演唱：王若琳
[00:19.26]
[00:20.26]We've only just begun to live
[00:32.24]White lace and promises
[00:39.98]A kiss for luck and we're on our way
[00:47.35]We've only begun
[00:51.61]
[00:51.79]Before the rising sun we fly
[01:02.95]So many roads to choose
[01:10.69]We start out walking
[01:12.73]And learn to run
[01:18.26]And yes! We've just begun
[01:25.51]
[01:28.26]Sharin' horizons that are new to us
[01:35.75]Watchin' the signs along the way
[01:43.12]Talkin' it over just the two of us
[01:50.39]Workin' together day to day, together
[01:59.13]
[02:02.66]And when the evening comes we smile
[02:14.22]So much of life ahead
[02:22.09]We'll find a place where there's room to grow
[02:29.11]And yes! We've just begun
[02:35.42]
[02:39.39]Sharin' horizons that are new to us
[02:46.15]Watchin' the signs along the way
[02:53.52]Talkin' it over just the two of us
[03:00.82]Workin' together day to day, together, together
[03:13.77]
[03:17.52]And when the evening comes we smile
[03:29.18]So much of life ahead
[03:36.82]We'll find a place where there's room to grow
[03:43.91]And yes! We've just begun
[03:50.23]
[03:59.30]we only just begun
[04:04.95]
