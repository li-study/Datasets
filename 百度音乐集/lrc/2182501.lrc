[00:02.37]Long Shot
[00:03.06]Kelly Clarkson
[00:05.02]
[00:08.11]I felt it.
[00:09.02]The wire touched my neck and
[00:11.09]Then someone pulled it tighter
[00:13.01]I never saw it coming
[00:14.97]I started to back out and
[00:16.97]Then someone said good morning
[00:18.96]I took it as a warning
[00:20.90]I should have seen it coming
[00:22.81]So now I'll take a chance on
[00:24.86]This thing we may have started
[00:26.72]Intentional or not I
[00:28.75]Don't think we saw it coming
[00:30.64]It's all adding up to something
[00:32.60]That ask for some involvement
[00:34.58]That ask for our commitment
[00:36.48]I think I see it coming
[00:38.60]If we step out of that limb
[00:40.15]My heart beat, beats me senselessly
[00:43.93]Why's everything got to be so intense with me
[00:47.93]I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability
[00:52.79]In all probability
[00:54.80]
[00:54.90]It's a long shot but I say why not
[00:59.27]If I say forget it
[01:01.00]I know that I'll regret it
[01:03.14]It's a long shot just to beat these odds
[01:06.95]The chance is we won't make it
[01:08.63]But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
[01:13.56]'Cause you're the best I've got
[01:17.39]So take the long shot
[01:21.73]
[01:22.88]I realize that there is all this doubting
[01:25.66]Things we're both scared about that
[01:27.69]We'll never see them coming
[01:29.65]Throw caution to the wind and
[01:31.53]We'll see which way it's blowing
[01:33.54]And to this fully knowing
[01:35.49]We'll never see it coming
[01:36.97]'til it's much too close to stop
[01:38.99]
[01:39.25]My heart beat, beats me senselessly
[01:43.02]Why's everything got to be so intense with me
[01:46.95]I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability
[01:51.85]And all probability
[01:53.79]
[01:53.92]It's a long shot but I say why not
[01:58.22]If I say forget it
[01:60.00]I know that I'll regret it
[02:01.80]It's a long shot just to beat these odds
[02:06.10]The chance is we won't make it
[02:07.82]but i know if i don't take it, there's no chance
[02:12.51]'Cause you're the best I've got
[02:16.41]So take the long shot
[02:22.57]
[02:24.97]Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction
[02:28.58]And you fit my description
[02:30.63]I never saw you coming
[02:32.52]But we'll make it
[02:33.21]
[02:33.61]It's a long shot but I say why not
[02:37.60]If I say forget it
