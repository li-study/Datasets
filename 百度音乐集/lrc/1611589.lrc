[00:18.41]I never really feel quite right
[00:21.62]I don't know why, all I know is there's something wrong
[00:27.01]Every time I look at you, you seem so alive
[00:34.83]Tell me how do you do it, walk me through it
[00:39.46]I'm following every footstep
[00:42.75]Baby on your own you take a cautious step
[00:45.89]Do you wanna give it up?
[00:48.21]But all I want is for you to SHINE
[00:55.10]Shine down on me
[00:59.16]Shine on this life that's burning out
[01:16.44]I say a lot of things sometimes that don't come out right
[01:21.35]And I act like I don't know why
[01:25.01]I guess a reaction is all I was looking for
[01:33.28]You looked through me, you really knew me like no one has EVER looked before
[01:40.69]Baby on your own you take a cautious step
[01:43.92]Do you wanna give it up?
[01:46.27]But all I want is for you to SHINE
[01:53.10]Shine down on me
[01:57.25]Shine on this life that's burning out
[02:01.74]I know, I know, girl you got something
[02:05.35]SHINE (shine it on to me)
[02:09.75]Shine down on me (I wanna feel it)
[02:13.88]Shine on this life that's burning out
[02:42.59]Baby on your own you take a cautious step
[02:45.90]Do you wanna give it up?
[02:48.50]But all I want is for you to SHINE
[02:55.28]Shine down on me (just show me something)
[02:59.30]Shine on this life that's burning out (you give me something that I never
[03:03.39]know)
[03:07.47]Shine (it gonna kill me if you give something away)
[03:11.90]Shine yeaaah (I wanna know what's going in on your mind)
[03:15.92]Shine on this life that's burning out
