[00:09.88]It's time
[00:13.44]
[00:27.27]Here At Home
[00:30.83]The Thoughts Racing Through My Crazy Mind
[00:34.40]Trying To Figure Out
[00:37.19]If I'm Loving You This One More Time
[00:41.12]And When I Got The Mail
[00:43.27]It Made Me Close The Door Just Right Behind
[00:47.78]On A Trail Of Clothes
[00:50.33]Left Lying Here
[00:52.95]Thrown Across The Floor Now
[00:54.86]Maybe It's The Way This Love
[00:56.86]Was Meant To Be
[01:01.29]And Maybe It's The Only Way
[01:03.34]For You And Me
[01:07.05]
[01:07.64]It's Time To Say Goodbye
[01:14.35]It's Time Oh Please Don't Cry Girl
[01:21.38]It's Time Two Reasons Why
[01:27.96]It's Time I Will Never Lie To You
[01:40.01]
[01:42.11]You Cast Your Spell
[01:44.81]But The Magic Has Been Broken Down
[01:48.65]And I'm All Packed Up
[01:51.46]With Empty Bottles Lying All Around
[01:55.58]It's Like A Flickering Flame
[01:58.24]That Casts A Shadow On The Brightest Day
[02:02.14]And It Does It Help To Know
[02:04.71]That I Feel The Same
[02:07.83]And It's Gone Now
[02:09.14]Maybe It's The Way This Love
[02:11.22]Was Meant To Be
[02:15.86]And Maybe It's The Only Way For You And Me
[02:22.30]It's Time To Say Goodbye
[02:29.04]It's Time Oh Please Don't Cry Girl
[02:35.57]It's Time Two Reasons Why
[02:42.46]It's Time I Will Never Lie
[02:50.00]
[02:52.53]It's Time To Say Goodbye
[02:59.32]It's Time Oh Please Don't Cry Girl
[03:06.07]It's Time Two Reasons Why
[03:12.69]It's Time I Will Never Lie To You
