[00:25]Sung By "TLC"
[00:34]
[00:35]A lonely mother gazing out of her window
[00:38]Staring at a son that she just can't touch
[00:43]If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
[00:49]But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
[00:56]But all the praying just ain't helping
[01:00]At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
[01:03]His self out of trouble
[01:06]So he goes out and he makes his money
[01:09]The best way he knows how
[01:11]Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me
[04:17][03:54][02:48][02:25][01:18]1-Don't go chasing waterfalls
[04:21][03:58][02:52][02:29][01:22]Please stick to the rivers
[04:23][04:01][02:54][02:32][01:24]And the lakes that you're used to
[04:26][04:04][02:57][02:35][01:28]I know that you're gonna have it your way
[04:30][04:08][03:01][02:38][01:31]Or nothing at all
[04:10][03:03][02:41][01:33]But I think you're moving too fast
[01:41]Little precious has a natural obsession
[01:45]For temptation but he just can't see
[01:52]She gives him loving that his body can't handle
[01:57]But all he can say is baby it's good to me
[02:03]One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
[02:08]But he doesn't recognize his own face
[02:14]His health is fading and he doesn't know why
[02:18]3 letters took him to his final resting place
[02:23]Y'all don't hear me?
[03:11]I see a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
[03:13]Have come and gone leavin' a trace of not
[03:15]Good-given ray, is it because my life is ten
[03:17]Shades of gray, I pray all ten fade away
[03:19]Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
[03:21]And like His promise is true only my faith can undo
[03:23]The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
[03:26]Clear blue and unconditional skies
[03:27]Have dried the tears from my eyes
[03:29]No more lonely cri endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
[03:30]Who's to bl a shame
[04:34]
[04:35]The End.
