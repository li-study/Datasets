[00:19.03]Every now and then we find a special friend
[00:27.35]Who never lets us down
[00:34.88]Who understands it all
[00:38.67]Reaches out each time you fall
[00:43.34]You're the best friend that I've found
[00:51.43]I know you can't stay
[00:55.44]A part of you will never ever go away
[01:02.67]Your heart will stay
[01:05.37]
[01:08.42]I'll make a wish for you
[01:13.35]And hope it will come true
[01:17.16]Then life will just be kind
[01:21.45]To such a gentle mind
[01:25.17]And If you lose your way
[01:29.13]Think back on yesterday
[01:33.02]Remember me this way

[01:56.95]The love you bring to me
[02:01.44]No matter where I go
[02:07.94]And I know that you'll be there
[02:13.08]For ever more a part of me you're everywhere
[02:20.75]I'll always care
[02:24.72]
[02:25.91]I'll make a wish for you
[02:31.07]And hope it will come true

[02:46.60]Think back on yesterday
[02:50.07]Remember me this way
[02:54.51]Remember me this way
[02:57.26]
[02:59.54]And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you
[03:07.31]I'll be standing by your side in all you do
[03:14.00]And I won't ever leave as long as you believe
[03:22.10]You just believe...

[03:25.92]I'll make a wish for you
[03:30.04]And hope it will come true
