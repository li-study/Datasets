[00:08.75]You know I'm not dead
[00:12.25]You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
[00:15.56]You know I'm not dead
[00:19.31]Now you know where I've been
[00:25.98]As you sleep, shine I am
[00:32.55]Waiting down patiently
[00:39.22]Born of love
[00:42.27]You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
[00:46.40]I'm just living in my head
[00:49.76]Forever waiting on the ways of your desire
[00:58.75]You always find your way
[01:06.17]And through it all, into us all you move
[01:15.88]Forgotten touch, forbidden thought
[01:21.57]We can never, ever know
[01:26.82]You know I'm not dead
[01:30.00]You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
[01:33.34]You know I'm not dead
[01:35.92]Down below the creatures scream
[01:43.01]Strangehold of God's machines
[01:49.27]Begging to tear us out
[01:56.71]Torn is hope
[01:58.71]You know I'm, you know I'm not dead
[02:02.81]I'm just the tears inside your head
[02:06.07]Forever waiting on the ways of your desire
[02:14.66]You always find a way
[02:21.96]And through it all, into us all you move
[02:31.66]Forgotten touch, forbidden thought
[02:37.42]We can never, ever know
[02:43.21]You know I'm not dead
[02:44.72]We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze
[02:47.73]Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway
[02:51.00]But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog
[02:54.09]The fickle fascination of an everlasting God
[02:57.09]You know I'm not dead
[03:00.21]I'm just living in my head
[03:03.43]Forever waiting
[03:06.90]Forever waiting on cruel death
[03:09.90]You know I'm not dead
[03:13.14]I'm just living for myself
[03:15.87]Forever waiting
[03:20.97]You know I'm not dead
[03:24.07]You know I'm not dead
[03:27.33]You know I'm not dead
[03:35.53]You know I'm not dead
