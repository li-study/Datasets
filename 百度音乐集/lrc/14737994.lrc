[00:03.62]凯莉米洛 - I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY
[00:08.40]
[00:17.82]In my imagination
[00:20.26]There is no complication
[00:22.12]I dream about you all the time
[00:26.11]In my mind a celebration
[00:28.20]The sweetest of sensation
[00:30.74]Thinking you could be mine
[00:33.71]
[02:21.80][00:34.63]In my imagination
[02:23.89][00:36.40]There is no hesitation
[02:26.08][00:38.64]We walk together hand in hand
[02:28.95][00:41.51]I’m dreaming
[02:31.02][00:43.06]You fell in love with me
[02:32.62][00:45.23]Like I’m in love with you
[02:34.82][00:47.20]But dreaming’s all I do
[02:36.41][00:48.85]If only they’d come true
[02:38.24][00:50.78]

[01:09.63]You always keep me waiting
[01:11.66]Because its only make believe
[01:15.78]And I would come a-running
[01:17.78]To give you all my loving
[01:19.86]If one day you would notice me
[01:22.45]
[01:24.04]My heart is close to break
[01:25.98]And I can’t go on faking
[01:28.04]The fantasy that you’ll be mine
[01:31.10]I’m dreaming
[01:32.78]That you’re in love with me
[01:35.20]Like I’m in love with you
[01:36.92]But dreaming’s all I do
