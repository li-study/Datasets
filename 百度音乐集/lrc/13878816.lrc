[00:10]True
[00:13]
[00:38]So true funny how it seems
[00:42]always in time, but never in line for dreams
[00:48]Head over heels when toe to toe
[00:53]This is the sound of my soul,
[00:58]this is the sound
[01:02]I bought a ticket to the world,
[01:07]but now I've come back again
[01:12]Why do I find it hard to write the next line
[01:16]Oh I want the truth to be said
[01:22]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[01:25]I know this much is true
[01:31]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[01:35]I know this much is true
[01:43]
[01:49]With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
[01:54]dissolve the nerves that have just begun
[01:59]Listening to Marvin (all night long)
[02:04]This is the sound of my soul,
[02:09]this is the sound
[02:13]Always slipping from my hands,
[02:18]sand's a time of its own
[02:23]Take your seaside arms and write the next line
[02:27]Oh I want the truth to be known
[02:32]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[02:36]I know this much is true
[02:42]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[02:46]I know this much is true
[02:54]
[03:38]I bought a ticket to the world,
[03:43]but now I've come back again
[03:48]Why do I find it hard to write the next line
[03:52]Oh I want the truth to be said
[03:57]
[04:00]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[04:04]I know this much is true
[04:10]Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
[04:14]I know this much is true
[04:39][04:37][04:28]This much is true
[04:44]I know, I know, I know this much is true
