[00:13.01]I would march across the desert to defeat my enemy
[00:19.18]And i would lie here in the trenches with your picture next to me
[00:25.46]And when i told you it's forever then that's how it's gonna be
[00:31.81]Don't wanna let him just take the place of me (no)
[00:37.72]Does he really know you like i know you, all the little things
[00:43.86]Does he really love you like i love you, how can he compete
[00:50.21]If he makes me fight for you, die for you
[00:53.98]Would he do the same
[00:56.88]This is turning to way more than a game
[01:00.74]
[01:01.91]Now it feels like soldiers in a war
[01:05.50]Non of us are backing down
[01:08.72]And i will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
[01:14.88]Cos he don't wanna leave and i don't wanna go
[01:18.12]And i know just how this battle goes
[01:21.24]He don't wanna leave and i don't wanna fight this kind of war
[01:25.33]
[01:27.79]You know he's not the man you think he is, he's hiding all his flaws
[01:33.95]So tell me what's the point of fighting because we'll all end up with scars
[01:40.23]But god if that's what i must go through than i'm not prepared to lose
[01:46.92]Cos i've already bled so much for you (no)
[01:52.48]Does he really know you like i know you, all the little things
[01:58.32]Does he really love you like i love you, how can he compete
[02:04.78]If he makes me fight for you, die for you
[02:08.87]Would he do the same
[02:11.19]Baby this is turning to way more than a game
[02:13.87]

[02:39.88]I'm getting kinda sick of this battle
[02:42.46]Wish i could take it back to when i had you
[02:45.53]I'm almost thinking that he can have you, just let him have you
[02:53.43]It's getting kinda hard to convince you
[02:56.58]After all the sh*t that we've been through
[02:59.66]Why would you let all this happen
[03:02.81]You got a choice to make it stop
[03:05.16]Its already gone too far girl
[03:05.59]We're soldiers in a war
[03:07.82]And non of us are backing down
