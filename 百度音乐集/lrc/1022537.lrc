[00:16.66]Baby Jane, don't leave me hanging on the line
[00:23.79]I knew you when you had no one to talk to
[00:31.58]Now you're moving in high society
[00:38.77]Don't forget I know secrets about you
[00:46.60]I used to think you were on my side
[00:50.05]But now I'm no longer sure,
[00:54.17]I wish I knew what I know now before
[01:00.70]
[01:01.15]When I give my heart again
[01:04.50]I know, it's gonna last forever
[01:08.35]No one tell me where or when
[01:11.84]I know, it's gonna last forever
[01:15.24]
[01:15.90]Baby Jane, don't it make you feel sad
[01:23.11]Just when I thought that we were close to winning
[01:30.49]You and I were so close in every way
[01:37.91]Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
[01:45.67]I've said goodbye so many times
[01:48.81]The situation ain't all that new
[01:53.05]Optimism's my best defense
[01:55.89]I'll get through without you
[01:58.93]
[02:00.11]When I give my heart again
[02:03.28]I know, it's gonna last forever
[02:07.18]No one tell me where or when
[02:10.61]I know, it's gonna last forever
[02:14.73]I won't be that dumb again
[02:18.00]I know, it's gotta last forever
[02:22.03]When I fall in love again
[02:25.19]I know, it's gonna last forever
[02:29.03]
[02:51.57]Baby Jane, I've said all I want to say
[02:58.64]So go your own way don't think twice about me
[03:06.11]I've got ideas and I've got plans of my own
[03:13.93]So long darlin' I'll miss you believe me
[03:21.16]The lesson learned was so hard to swallow
[03:24.65]But I know I'll survive
[03:28.61]I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry
[03:33.51]
[03:35.76]When I give my heart again
[03:38.54]I know, it's gonna last forever
[03:42.72]No one tell me where or when
[03:45.92]I know, it's gonna last forever
[03:50.05]When I fall in love next time
[03:53.32]I know, it's gonna last forever
[03:57.39]I won't be that dumb again
[04:00.62]I know, it's gonna last forever
[04:04.70]
