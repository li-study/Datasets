[00:03.88]
[00:08.62]Now everybody,
[00:12.55]has a right to be living their lives...
[00:16.92]Oh but we\'re a long, long way long way from paradise.
[00:26.81]If there was freedom tell me why everybody wants to fight...
[00:35.27]Oh \'cause we\'re a long, long way a long way from paradise.
[00:43.05]You might be strong enough,
[00:46.34]You might be rich enough,
[00:50.02]You might be blind enough:
[00:54.54]To push it all aside.
[01:01.34]No matter what you do,
[01:04.57]it keeps come back to me and you.
[01:07.85]Give a little bit of love and you get it back,
[01:11.38]give a little bit of pain, you call it a track.
[01:15.29]For every little thing that you say or do.
[01:18.70]Give a little bit of love and it\'ll come back to you.
[01:30.52]You got you reasons,
[01:34.06]but are you sure their reasons to be right?
[01:38.63]Oh \'cause we\'re a long, long way a long way from paradise.
[01:48.04]Don\'t let your anger
[01:52.39]Or your fear become your suicide
[01:57.65]Oh\'cause we\'re a long long way a long way from paradise
[02:04.40]We must be strong enough,
[02:07.92]we must be brade enough,
[02:11.72]we waited long enough
[02:15.76]now it\'s time to say goodbye.
[02:22.95]We got some rules to band,
[02:26.07]to let the lies and truth belong.
[02:29.38]Give a little bit of love and you get it back,
[02:32.87]give a little bit of pain, you call it a track.
[02:36.83]For every little thing that you say or do.
