[00:02.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:04.26]Dear Lord can you take it away? (Oooh)
[00:11.18]This pain in my heart that just follows me by day
[00:18.00]And at night stalks me like the shawdows on my wall (Mmmmm)
[00:25.00]Oh, my goodness
[00:27.00]It feels like the world is closin' on me
[00:33.28]It feels like my dreams will never come to me
[00:40.13]I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
[00:44.84]And I'm scared, so scared
[00:52.19]If your troubled, you just gotta let it go
[00:58.84]If your worried baby, you just gotta let it go
[01:05.49]All your hustlin' scene for nothing, you just gotta take it slow
[01:11.98]When you need me baby, all you do is let me know
[01:19.50]Why does it feel that my mind is constantly trying to pull me down
[01:29.10]I can't seem to get away
[01:32.92]Continuous mistakes I know I'm able for
[01:38.38]How long will I feel so out of place
[01:45.01]If your troubled, you just gotta let it go
[01:51.68]If your worried baby, you just gotta let it go
[01:58.20]All your hustlin' scene for nothing, you just gotta take it slow
[02:04.63]When you need me baby, all you do is let me know
[02:24.60]If your troubled, you just gotta let it go
[02:31.08]If your worried baby, you just gotta let it go

[02:44.16]When you need me baby, all you do is let me know
[02:51.18]If your troubled, you just gotta let it go
[02:57.33]If your worried baby, you just gotta let it go

[03:10.70]When you need me baby, all you do is let me know
[03:17.66]If your troubled, you just gotta let it go
[03:23.27]If your worried baby, you just gotta let it go
