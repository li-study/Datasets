[01:36.99]Living for you is easy living
[01:42.12]It's easy to live when you're in love
[01:47.72]And I'm so in love
[01:50.48]There is nothing in life but you
[01:58.30]I never regret the years that I'm giving
[02:03.24]They're easy to give when you're in love
[02:08.58]I'm happy to do whatever I do for you
[02:14.69]For you maybe I'm a fool
[02:25.95]But it's fun
[02:29.06]People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
[02:35.52]Darling, it's grand
[02:38.60]They just don't understand
[02:42.07]Living for you is easy living
[02:44.78]It's easy to live when you're in love
[02:50.60]And I'm so in love
[02:55.22]There's nothing in life but you
