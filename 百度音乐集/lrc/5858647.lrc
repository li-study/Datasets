[00:08.42]Ours - Dizzy
[00:16.55]
[00:22.24]We ran
[00:26.41]We starved the things
[00:30.49]That feel
[00:32.99]
[00:38.70]Outback
[00:40.87]
[00:42.92]The drunken waters steal from me
[00:52.70]
[00:57.48]If we beat him down, will he stay?
[01:03.22]He's a little dizzy
[01:06.26]I feel it starting to take me
[01:11.14]Where did everybody go?
[01:14.13]I need them now
[01:16.16]To save me
[01:19.43]
[01:22.57]We fell, when they choked the things that feed
[01:33.00]
[01:38.58]How come... we hurt the one's we need?
[01:49.89]
[01:55.09]Lay down, and stretch upon the sea
[02:09.69]
[02:13.77]If we beat him down, will he stay?
[02:19.30]He's a little dizzy
[02:22.79]I feel it starting to take me
[02:27.72]Where did everybody go?
[02:30.53]I need them now
[02:38.40]If we beat him down... will he stay?
[02:44.82]
[03:19.81]If we beat him down, will he stay?
[03:25.27]He's a little dizzy
[03:28.15]I feel it starting to take me
[03:33.47]Where did everybody go?
[03:36.49]I need them now
[03:44.40]If we beat him down
[03:52.27]
