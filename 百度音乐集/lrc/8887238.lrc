[00:16.01]we are not together here
[00:19.78]though we lie entwined
[00:23.75]to make room for the other presence
[00:29.15]we both draw back in our minds
[00:31.89]I have a prophecy
[00:35.43]threatening to spill into words
[00:39.17]this growing certainty
[00:43.84]of over
[00:46.55]
[00:46.64]there once was a time I was sure of the bond
[00:51.25]when my hands and my tongue and my thoughts were enough
[00:56.74]we are the same but our lives move along
[01:01.85]and the third one between replaces what once was love
[01:09.46]
[01:17.23]freedom is being alone
[01:20.58]I fear liberation
[01:24.99]but something more alive than silence
[01:29.68]swallows conversation
[01:32.97]no pleasing drama
[01:36.88]in subtle averted eyes
[01:40.62]the swelling fermata
[01:44.77]as the chord dies
[01:47.93]
[01:48.70]there once was a time I was sure of the bond
[01:53.88]when my hands and my tongue and my thoughts were enough
[01:59.44]we are the same but our lives move along
[02:04.42]and the third one between replaces what once was love
[02:18.46]
[02:38.73]there's no denying we feel the third one
[02:44.89]we do
[02:46.86]I'm tired of hiding and so are you
[02:54.53]
[02:55.43]there once was a time I was sure of the bond
[03:00.69]when my hands and my tongue and my thoughts were enough
[03:06.25]we are the same but our lives move along
[03:11.12]and the third one between replaces what once was love
