[00:43.50]
[00:44.50]Sailing down behind the sun,
[00:48.50]Waiting for my prince to come.
[00:54.50]Praying for the healing rain
[00:59.50]To restore my soul again.
[01:04.50]Just a toerag on the run.
[01:09.50]How did I get here?
[01:13.50]What have I done?
[01:15.50]When will all my hopes arise?
[01:20.50]How will I know him?
[01:22.50]When I look in my father's eyes.
[01:25.50](look in my father's eyes)
[01:29.50]My father's eyes.
[01:32.50]When I look in my father's eyes.
[01:36.50](look in my father's eyes)
[01:39.50]My father's eyes.
[01:49.50]Then the light begins to shine
[01:53.50]I hear those ancient lullabys.
[01:59.50]And as I watch this seedling grow,
[02:03.50]Feel my heart start to overflow.
[02:08.50]Where do I find the words to say?
[02:14.50]How do I teach him?
[02:16.50]What do we play?
[02:19.50]Bit by bit, I've realized
[02:24.50]That's when I need them,
[02:27.50]That's when I need my father's eyes.
[02:30.50](look in my father's eyes)
[02:33.50]My father's eyes.
[02:37.50]That's when I need my father's eyes.
[02:40.50](look in my father's eyes)
[02:43.50]My father's eyes.
[02:50.50](Instrumental)
[03:32.50]Then the jagged edge appears
[03:35.50]Through the distant clouds of tears.
[03:41.50]I'm like a bridge that was washed away;
[03:45.50]My foundations were made of clay.
[03:51.50]As my soul slides down to die.
[03:57.50]How could I lose him?
[03:59.50]What did I try?
[04:02.50]Bit by bit, I've realized
[04:07.50]That he was here with me;
[04:09.50]I looked into my father's eyes.
[04:12.50](look in my father's eyes)
[04:16.50]My father's eyes.
[04:19.50]I looked into my father's eyes.
[04:22.50](look in my father's eyes)
[04:26.50]My father's eyes.
[04:29.50]My father's eyes.
[04:33.50](look in my father's eyes)
[04:36.50]My father's eyes.
[04:40.50]I looked into my father's eyes.
[04:43.50](look in my father's eyes)
[04:47.50]My father's eyes.
[04:50.50](look in my father's eyes...)
[05:12.50]
