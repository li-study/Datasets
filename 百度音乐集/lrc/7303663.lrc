[04:15.00][04:00.10][03:33.00][02:59.50][02:17.30][01:51.00][01:17.05][00:07.00]
[00:50.50]Come a little bit closer
[00:55.50]Hear what I have to say
[01:07.03]Just like children sleeping
[01:12.30]We could dream this night away.
[01:24.06]But there's a full moon rising
[01:28.50]Lets go dancing in the light
[01:41.04]We know where the music's playing
[01:45.30]Let's go out and feel the night.
[03:50.16][03:41.00][02:07.51][01:58.07]Because I'm still in love with you
[02:03.16]I want to see you dance tonight
[03:55.01][02:11.70]On this harvest moon.
[02:33.20]When we were strangers
[02:37.50]I watched you from afar
[02:49.30]When we were lovers
[02:53.40]I loved you with all my heart.
[03:06.50]But now its getting late
[03:10.60]And the moon is climbing high
[03:23.50]I want to celebrate
[03:28.20]See it shining in your eye.
[03:46.00]I want to see you dance again
