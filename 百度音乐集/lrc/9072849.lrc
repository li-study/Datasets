[00:06.75]
[00:22.35]So many times
[00:24.71]I've played around
[00:27.90]Moving from one to another
[00:33.47]I've been a fool
[00:35.84]I've been unkind
[00:38.74]But being with you made me discover
[00:43.68]That trust and honesty
[00:46.91]Is all I really need
[00:49.44]And I should never let it slip away
[00:54.28]'cause girl
[00:55.81]Seeing you shine by the candle-light
[00:58.24]Got me hooked, and it feels so right
[01:01.18]So good that baby I
[01:03.91]I don't want this night to be over
[01:06.78]Stay right here oh please don't leave
[01:09.42]Let's star in our own love scene
[01:12.11]Then chill and spend the night
[01:14.78]It's too soon to say goodbye
[01:18.33]
[01:23.23]It's too soon to say goodbye
[01:28.60]Darlin' I know
[01:30.74]You're the type who goes slow
[01:33.39]And trust when I say
[01:35.51]I don't mean to rush you
[01:38.51]But give it some thought
[01:41.30]If you're all alone
[01:44.57]You're just gonna wish
[01:46.79]That I was there too
[01:49.41]Imagine you and me
[01:52.41]As close as two can be
[01:55.37]We can let it flow for eternity girl
[02:01.25]Seeing you shine by the candle-light
