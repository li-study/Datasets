[00:00.00]Maroon 5 - Better That We Break
[00:00.20]
[00:00.52]I never knew perfection ‘til
[00:03.34]I heard you speak, and now it kills me
[00:06.60]Just to hear you say the simple things
[00:10.38]
[00:12.42]Now waking up is hard to do
[00:15.34]And sleeping’s impossible too
[00:18.34]Everything’s reminding me of you
[00:22.75]What can I do?
[00:23.06]
[00:24.87]It’s not right, not OK
[00:28.29]Say the word it should say
[00:33.28]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[00:37.04]I’m not fine, I’m in pain
[00:40.32]It’s harder everyday
[00:45.27]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[00:48.59]It’s better that we break…
[00:51.28]
[00:51.64]A fool to let you slip away
[00:54.54]I chase you just to hear you say
[00:57.50]You’re scared and that you think that I’m insane
[01:02.59]
[01:03.57]I see you look so nice from here
[01:06.74]Pity I can’t see it clearly
[01:09.96]While you’re standing there, it disappears
[01:14.10]It disappears
[01:15.53]
[01:16.45]It’s not right, not OK
[01:18.71]
[01:19.70]Say the word it should say
[01:24.61]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[01:28.33]I’m not fine, I’m in pain
[01:31.78]It’s harder everyday
[01:36.70]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[01:40.04]It’s better that we break up
[01:42.71]
[01:43.76]Saw you sitting all alone
[01:48.82]You’re fragile and you’re cold, but that’s all right
[01:55.03]Life these days is getting rough
[01:57.92]It knocks you down and beats you up
[02:01.04]But it’s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeh
[02:06.63]
[02:07.30]It’s not right, not OK
[02:10.59]Say the word it should say
[02:15.57]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[02:19.21]I’m not fine, I’m in pain
[02:22.60]It’s harder everyday
[02:27.43]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[02:31.20]I’m not fine, not OK
[02:34.60]Say the word it should say
[02:39.47]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[02:43.35]I’m not fine, I’m in pain
[02:46.68]It’s harder everyday
[02:51.52]Maybe we’re better off this way?
[02:55.07]It’s better that we break, baby
[02:58.38]
