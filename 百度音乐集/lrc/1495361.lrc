[00:11.00][01:33.95][02:19.39][03:43.72][04:13.89][04:41.46]　
[00:24.96]we were too quiet
[00:28.48]too quiet on the phone
[00:33.70]I could only guess
[00:36.57]I had to guess
[00:40.14]what was on your mind
[00:45.39]and were you thinking of the good old days
[00:53.66]Melancholically just like me
[00:59.24]Hmm
[01:02.33]don't they seem like yesterday
[01:09.42][04:16.14]on that hill　where we used to go
[01:16.51][04:22.98]all the leaves are turning red (when the time comes)
[01:23.36][04:29.76]soon they'll fall (soon they will fall)
[01:26.73][04:33.04]leaving us silently with winter snow
[01:37.92][02:01.23][03:02.42][03:26.41]I'd better go back
[01:42.23][02:05.55][03:06.72][03:30.05]to where I came from
[01:49.19]to the days we laughed
[01:53.21]our tears and fears away sometimes
[02:11.45][03:35.89]to know that once again
[02:17.01][03:42.07]we're friends
[03:13.64]to the days you stayed
[03:17.70]when no one else was on my side
[03:55.77]I don't know if
[03:59.50]the rain will stop
[04:03.68]I could only guess
[04:07.42]I don't know
[04:10.62]what is on your mind
