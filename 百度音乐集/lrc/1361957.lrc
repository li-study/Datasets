[00:00.00]Norah Jones - Nightingale
[00:10.78]
[01:04.23][00:12.78]Nightingale
[01:07.67][00:15.94]Sing us a song
[01:12.53][00:20.82]Of a love that once belonged
[01:17.36][00:25.63]Nightingale
[01:19.82][00:28.80]Tell me your tale
[01:25.29][00:33.69]Was your journey far too long?
[00:38.36]Does it seem like I'm looking for an answer
[00:46.76]To a question I can't ask
[00:53.11]I don't know which way the feather falls
[00:59.52]Or if I should blow it to the left
[02:47.11][01:30.21]All the voices that are spinnin' around me
[02:54.83][01:38.21]Trying to tell me what to say
[03:01.13][01:44.51]Can I fly right behind you
[03:07.44][01:50.85]And you can take me away
[03:13.12][01:56.69]
[03:20.71]You can take me away
[03:24.61]
