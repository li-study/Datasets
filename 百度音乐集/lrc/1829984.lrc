[00:01.41]I feel like I've been here once before
[00:05.82]You threw my bags out through the
[00:08.19]Door and in the Road
[00:11.85]I came home to find them on the floor
[00:16.62]And as the rain began to poor
[00:19.33]I got cold
[00:21.04]
[00:22.51]And I tried to compromise
[00:24.90]But you keep telling all these lies
[00:27.74]Now I don't get to say my
[00:30.27]Last goodbyes
[00:32.16]
[00:32.73]Goodbye to you've been wastin
[00:35.53]All my time
[00:37.80]Your no longer mine
[00:40.32]Now you've left me
[00:41.77]I can't seem to get you off my mind
[00:45.60]Thats when I realised you had me hynotized
[00:54.45]
[00:55.21]Why am I now living on my own
[00:59.85]She keeps inviting people home all the time
[01:06.08]Why am I still paying for her phone
[01:10.86]When all the luxuries she owns should be mine
[01:14.97]
[01:16.71]Now I start to wunder why
[01:19.04]You shrug me off when I say hi
[01:22.03]You treat me so bad
[01:23.54]Despite how hard I try
[01:25.53]
[01:27.06]Goodbye to you've been wastin
[01:29.81]All my time
[01:31.96]Your no longer mine
[01:34.63]Now you've left me
[01:36.41]I can't seem to get you off my mind
[01:40.06]Thats when I realised you had me hynotized
[01:50.09]Girl you can't hold me back no more
[01:55.67]Your not even worth me writing lyrics for
[02:01.13]We had something good together
[02:03.89]Do you think you were being clever
[02:06.35]To throw me out in awfull weather
[02:08.83]How do I forget you now
[02:12.69]
[02:23.35]I can't get you off my mind
[02:26.05]That's when I realised you had me hypnotised
[02:32.44]Goodbye to you've been wastin
[02:35.10]All my time
[02:37.05]Your no longer mine
[02:39.73]Now you've left me
[02:41.13]I can't seem to get you off my mind
[02:44.83]Thats when I realised you had me hynotized
