[00:05.00]Kitaro with Pages - Caravan
[00:10.00]
[00:15.74]Once a long, long time ago
[00:18.87]Setting out to find our dreams
[00:22.24]Lost in memories of olden days
[00:29.07]Sometimes rising in the spring
[00:32.42]Glowing, shining came the sun
[00:35.79]Golden day beams come through to me now
[00:41.00]
[00:42.98]Those who know the firebird
[00:49.78]Try to find forever the dreams
[00:56.48]Try to find forever the way, my way
[01:05.00]
[01:05.82][02:45.45][03:56.47][04:38.92]Caravan, journey in the sky
[01:12.55][02:52.13][04:03.16][04:45.57]As the sun comes out from the day
[01:19.31][02:58.94][04:09.95]Caravan, we know who we are
[01:26.14][03:05.66][04:16.72]We discover where or when
[01:32.89][03:12.48][04:23.54]Caravan, now we find a love
[01:39.66][03:19.24][04:30.39]Love shimmering and soon our love is gone
[01:51.50][03:43.00]
[01:55.28]Come with me and take my hand
[01:58.72]Memories of the past unfold
[02:02.06]And with you I'll live them once again
[02:08.89]From my beating heart, my hand
[02:12.20]Feel my warmth and love within
[02:15.62]And I wonder when the spring will come
[02:21.00]
[02:22.51]Do we ever really know for sure?
[02:29.64]Will we travel on and on?
[02:36.27]Someday will be standing up but to live.
