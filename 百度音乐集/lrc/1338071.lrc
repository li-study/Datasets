[00:01.50]Welcome To Paradise
[00:04.50]
[00:11.50]Dear mother,
[00:12.50]Can you hear me whining?
[00:16.50]It's been three whole weeks
[00:17.50]Since I left your home
[00:21.50]This sudden fear has left me trembling
[00:26.50]Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
[00:31.50]And I'm feeling so alone
[00:35.50]
[00:36.50]Pay attention to the cracked streets
[00:38.50]And broken homes
[00:41.50]Some call it the slums
[00:42.50]Some call it nice
[00:46.50]I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
[00:53.50]Welcome to paradise
[00:58.50]
[01:00.50]A gunshot rings out at the station
[01:05.50]Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
[01:10.50]It makes me wonder why I'm still here
[01:15.50]For some strange reason it's now
[01:18.50]Feeling like my home
[01:20.50]And I'm never gonna go
[01:23.50]
[01:24.50]Pay attention to the cracked streets
[01:27.50]And broken homes
[01:30.50]Some call it the slums
[01:31.50]Some call it nice
[01:35.50]I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
[01:41.50]Welcome to paradise
[01:47.50]
[02:48.50]Dear mother, can you hear me laughing
[02:53.50]It's been six whole months since
[02:55.50]I have left your home
[02:58.50]It makes me wonder why I'm still here
[03:03.50]For some strange reason it's now
[03:06.50]Feeling like my home
[03:08.50]And I'm never gonna go
[03:11.50]
[03:12.50]Pay attention to the cracked streets
[03:15.50]And broken homes
[03:17.50]Some call it the slums
[03:19.50]Some call it nice
[03:22.50]I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
[03:30.50]Welcome to paradise
[03:35.50]
