[00:14]Now that I've lost everything to you,
[00:18]you say you want to start something new,
[00:21]and it's breaking my heart you're leaving,
[00:25]baby I'm grieving.
[00:28]But if you wanna leave take good care,
[00:31]hope you have a lot of nice things to wear,
[00:34]but then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.
[02:59][02:32][01:38][00:43]Oh baby baby it's a wild world,
[03:06][02:39][01:44][00:49]it's hard to get by just upon a smile.
[03:13][02:46][01:51][00:56]Oh baby baby it's a wild world,
[03:20][02:53][01:57][01:03]I'll always remember you like a child, girl.
[01:09]You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do,
[01:13]and it's breaking my heart in two,
[01:16]'cause I never want to see you sad girl,
[01:20]don't be a bad girl,
[01:23]but if you want to leave take good care,
[01:26]hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,
[01:30]but just remember there's a lot of bad and beware, beware,
[02:15]Baby I love you, but if wanna leave take good care,
[02:21]hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,
[02:25]but just remember there's a lot of bad, and beware,
