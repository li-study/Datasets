[00:02.00]-From Russia With Love-
[00:03.00]Matt Munro
[00:04.00]Music by John Barry
[00:06.00]
[00:07.00]From Russia with love
[00:14.19]I fly to you,
[00:19.00]Much wiser since my good-bye to you.
[00:30.60]I've traveled the world to learn,
[00:37.47]I must return from Russia with love.
[00:48.39]
[00:49.94]I've seen places,
[00:54.73]faces and smiled for a moment,
[01:02.70]But oh, you haunted me so.
[01:12.00]Still my tongue tied young pride,
[01:19.00]Would not let my love for you show
[01:28.00]In case you'd say no.
[01:33.39]
[01:35.88]To Russia I flew
[01:43.05]but there and then,
[01:48.00]I suddenly knew you'd care again.
[01:57.00]My running around is through,
[02:07.18]I fly to you
[02:12.61]from Russia with
[02:17.20]love
[02:23.31]â€¦
[02:27.00]
