[00:05.38]Some people say a man is made outta mud
[00:10.37]A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
[00:13.98]Muscle and blood and skin and bones
[00:16.98]A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
[00:20.15]You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
[00:23.67]Another day older and deeper in debt
[00:26.87]Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
[00:30.48]I owe my soul to the company store
[00:34.26]
[00:38.90]I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
[00:43.55]I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
[00:46.66]I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
[00:49.95]And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"
[00:53.16]You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
[00:56.83]Another day older and deeper in debt
[00:59.92]Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
[01:03.53]I owe my soul to the company store
[01:08.84]
[01:12.12]I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
[01:16.96]Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
[01:20.10]I was raised in the canebrake* by an ol' mama lion
[01:23.17]Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line
[01:26.75]You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
[01:30.26]Another day older and deeper in debt
[01:33.26]Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
[01:36.90]I owe my soul to the company store
[01:41.95]
[01:46.71]If you see me comin', better step aside
[01:51.44]A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
[01:54.85]One fist of iron, the other of steel
[01:57.95]If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will
[02:00.99]You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
[02:04.79]Another day older and deeper in debt
[02:07.69]Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
[02:13.93]I owe my soul to the company store
