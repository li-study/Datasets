[00:27.85]it's my specidal play for you.....
[00:28.94]and since the day of our birth;
[00:31.23]our humble existence on earth
[00:31.57]for some,life is like a blessing,
[00:32.02]for some,it's worse than a curse
[00:32.65]but when you're facing drama,
[00:34.45]you know you gotta stay a soldier
[00:36.08]whether you pray to the lord,
[00:37.46]brahma,allah,even buddha
[00:38.91]maybe we should listen to the pope
[00:40.17]and listen to the dalai lama but now
[00:41.64]everywhere is war;
[00:43.36]children grown into trauma
[00:44.55]phobias drive us in (to)conflicts;
[00:45.91]religious racial economic
[00:47.30]creeds,and convictions.
[00:48.77]we're fighting each other over bullshit
[00:50.14]but that's the life,the strife;
[00:51.57]that's just the way it goes
[00:52.91]no one really gets along;we're all enemies and foes
[00:54.47]we take(away)each other's freedom
[00:55.40]forthe most selfish reasons
[00:57.29]somehow we're all killers;we kill as we're breathin
[01:01.67]by not helping grandparents,
[01:03.07]mothers,sisters,and brothers
[01:04.58]father,please forgive us before
[01:05.98]we all hurt one another
[01:07.31]the only thing universal is blood,sweat,and tears
[01:08.75]for years the young the elderly and all my dying peers
[01:13.10]it's time to say goodbte but baby don't u cry
[01:18.65]你不要太难过因为我一直都在
[01:24.39]cuz i'll be there up high be always by ur side
[01:30.08]你不会太寂寞因为我不曾离开
[01:47.34]也许上帝创造生命只是一个笑话为什么
[01:50.45]人们虽然知道生命是无价却互相残杀
[01:54.06]和平世界只会出现在童话
[01:55.90]现实生活中的生命总是遭到无情践踏无穷的欲望
[02:00.10]每个人都想拥有一切最后的希望谁能拯救这世界
[02:04.21]别让它从和平意识还在萌芽的时候
[02:07.14]就被疯狂的人类进行攻击而遭到毁灭
[02:10.47]面对死亡的时候才会知道真相
[02:13.29]当生命结束的时候一切都只是假象
[02:16.06]就像梦一场你能带走哪一样
[02:18.49]金钱权力或毒品哪个能够带上天堂
[02:21.77]天上的神请帮助我教导我该怎么做
[02:24.62]才能够让世人了解这后果
[02:27.16]如果当子弹穿过脑袋的时候才能够看透
[02:30.31]也许这世界已经没有救没有救
[02:32.84]it's time to say goodbte but baby don't u cry
[02:38.31]你不要太难过因为我一直都在
[02:43.93]cuz i'll be there up high be always by ur side
[02:49.70]你不会太寂寞因为我不曾离开
[02:55.50]why when i open my eyes,i see no peace and no love?
[02:58.16]i see people cry and die,
[02:59.50]more tears more sweat more blood
[03:01.04]living under constant danger,
[03:02.23]it don't matter where you are
[03:03.68]somehow someone will always be
[03:05.21]more than ready to start a war
[03:06.54]each day,hour,and second,gotta hold on to your weapon
[03:09.47]and if they kill you first,die a hero go to heaven
[03:12.21]some fight for more power and some fight for equality
[03:14.98]killing each other for money,resources
[03:16.75],and territories
[03:18.94]i've seen the barrel of guns
[03:21.43]and they took away my friends
[03:22.06]sometimes it seems to me that
[03:22.58]we are all headed fot dead ends
[03:23.64]headed no where fast;the next second might not last
[03:26.71]in a blink of an eye,we become a part of the past
[03:29.51]yesterday was history, tomorrow's a mystery
[03:32.32]today's a present;i thank the god above me
[03:35.20]cuz at every moment,it might be your last breath
[03:38.07]you could see your own death
[03:41.19]it's time to say goodbte but baby don't u cry
[03:46.51]你不要太难过因为我一直都在

[04:15.03]sorry妈妈我知道你对我的期待
[04:17.97]请你原谅我以前那么叛逆那么的坏
[04:20.71]妈妈please don't cry, dry ur eyes
[04:23.70]就算我在天上也会想念你烧的菜
[04:26.44]但是现在我要为兄弟奋力一搏
[04:29.16]我要保护着他就像你那么保护着我
[04:32.00]do u know ?我没有表面看起来那么懦弱
[04:35.23]我会干掉每一个敌人虽然我感觉到有些困惑
[04:38.22]为什么对我开枪为什么互相叫骂
[04:41.07]为什么让我受伤为什么同是人类却感到害怕
[04:44.58]为什么侵略我的家
[04:46.45]难道说和平真的只是古老的神话
[04:49.27]不过我还是站在这里
[04:51.00]保护我的兄弟
