[00:20.39]Three years or a lifetime
[00:25.07]Three words that just might have come too soon
[00:30.15]Three hours from somewhere
[00:32.74]I might have ended up with you
[00:36.31]
[00:38.96]Hold me like a river
[00:43.51]Hold me like a string tied to a balloon
[00:48.60]You get what you're given
[00:51.52]At any moment, a moment of truth
[00:54.91]
[00:56.78]All my life, I'm traveling light
[01:00.93]Been living in a sky
[01:05.50]I'll float, I'll fade up, I'll carry away
[01:10.26]'Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes
[01:18.54]
[01:25.35]I'm sorry for leaving
[01:30.12]I'm sorry for all, I could not do
[01:35.17]You knew it was coming
[01:37.85]Maybe in some ways, I did too
[01:42.07]
[01:43.52]The keys by the bedside
[01:47.73]And bags in the hall
[01:50.58]
[01:52.45]'Cause all my life, I'm traveling light
[01:56.96]Been living in a sky
[02:01.39]I'll float, I'll fade up , I'll carry away
[02:06.17]'Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes
[02:14.03]
[02:16.11]I'm searching for something
[02:19.71]In the ether of this mess
[02:25.35]Riding above these missing pieces
[02:31.79]Leaves me weightless
[02:37.44]
[02:46.44]All my life, I'm traveling light
[02:50.41]Been living in a sky
[02:54.96]I'll float, I'll fade up , I'll carry away
[02:59.70]'Til you pull me down and you think of me
[03:04.45]
[03:04.95]All my life, I'm traveling light
[03:08.91]Been living in a sky
[03:13.70]I'll float, I'll fade, I'll carry away
[03:18.37]'Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes, sometimes
