[00:12.46]We just had to ask
[00:15.60]Maybe some one out of heaven
[00:19.20]Would hear us down here
[00:24.10]We couldn't bear to stand
[00:27.54]How the people leave us waiting
[00:31.16]For something up there
[01:36.99][00:36.98]Oh, why did you leave?
[01:40.01][00:40.03]And why won't you come?
[01:43.01][00:42.97]And save us again?
[00:48.99]Come back to us spiders
[00:54.95]Come uncrushed my hand
[01:00.14]Let me sent beauty rain

[01:15.43]Some one there outside of heaven
[01:19.58]Heard us down here
[01:24.34]We couldn't stand it here
