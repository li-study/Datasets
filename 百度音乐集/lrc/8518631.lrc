[00:01.19]喜欢听歌
[00:04.50]吼吼
[00:08.05]你好，我叫Can
[00:16.78]I've been running to let go
[00:20.51]I've been running away from home
[00:31.27]My knees no longer hold
[00:35.19]But I can't stop
[00:40.35]It's still too easy to turn
[00:43.88]Time and time again you fade away
[00:48.86]And I wonder how you
[00:51.10]Still manage to beat the hell out of me
[00:58.12]Time and time again you seem to fail
[01:03.43]But it seems that you can
[01:05.48]Still manage to crush my self-esteem
[01:17.57]I'm hoping when I'm gone
[01:21.61]You realize I'm not that strong
[01:26.52]That I would suffocate my will to play along
[01:32.00]And I wish you'd understand
[01:35.98]I've sacrificed all I can
[01:41.27]To share my soul with you
[01:45.30]Time and time again you fade away
[01:50.09]And I wonder how you
[01:52.58]Still manage to beat the hell out of me
[01:59.50]Time and time again you seem to fail
[02:04.56]But it seems that you can
[02:06.86]Still manage to crush my self-esteem
[02:14.39]I got lost in the fire
[02:18.31]I tried to get away
[02:21.85]But the flames grew higher
[02:24.71]Too high for me
[02:50.02]Time and time again you fade away
[02:54.81]And I wonder how you
[02:57.17]Still manage to beat the hell out of me
[03:04.14]Time and time again you seem to fail
[03:09.18]But it seems that you can
[03:11.60]Still manage to crush my self-esteem
[03:18.64]Time and time
[03:20.69]time and time
[03:22.56]time and time again
[03:25.74]Still manage to beat the hell out of me
[03:33.46]yeah
[03:35.20]yeah
[03:40.31]Still manage to crush my self-esteem
