[00:03.11]
[00:14.35]The snow in Montana was three feet high
[00:21.05]The lady at the counter said: There ain't no flights
[00:27.97]And so he called her on the telephone
[00:34.64]He said: I'll rent a car and I'll drive home
[00:38.78]
[00:39.55]And she said: I'll wait for you
[00:43.61]Like I did last year
[00:46.94]At Christmas time with your family here
[00:53.51]And your truck broke down out in San Antone
[01:00.18]And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
[01:06.17]Oh, this ain't nothin' new
[01:12.69]Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
[01:17.24]
[01:21.03]Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe Deville
[01:27.79]Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
[01:34.59]His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
[01:41.15]Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home
[01:46.07]She says: I'll wait for you like in '68
[01:53.51]When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
[01:59.35]Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
[02:07.13]Remember, Dear, our son's first cry
[02:12.80]Oh, this ain't nothin' new
[02:19.32]Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
[02:23.77]
[02:28.24]He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
[02:34.39]And he finally got there around midnight
[02:41.56]The doctor said, she's in a better place
[02:47.60]She said to give this you this note just in case
[02:52.27]
[02:52.85]And it said, I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
[03:00.12]Oh, I don't care how long it takes
[03:06.90]And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
[03:13.56]Without my love and my best friend
[03:20.05]Oh, this ain't nothin' new
[03:25.98]Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
[03:32.79]P.S. I love you, too
[03:40.46]Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
[03:47.82]
