[00:21.71]Swaying room as the music starts
[00:27.20]Strangers making the most of the dark
[00:32.18]Two by two their bodies become one
[00:42.26]I see you through the smokey air
[00:47.22]Can''t you feel the weight of my stare
[00:52.46]You''re so close but still a world away
[00:58.84]What I''m dying to say, is that
[02:35.27][02:14.73][01:01.48]I''m crazy for you
[02:37.71][02:17.18][01:05.36]Touch me once and you''ll know it''s true
[02:42.33][02:22.06][01:10.12]I never wanted anyone like this
[02:46.59][02:26.39][01:14.18]It''s all brand new, you''ll feel it in my kiss
[02:53.40][01:20.94]I''m crazy for you, crazy for you
[03:08.07][03:03.01]crazy for you!
[01:34.57]Trying hard to control my heart
[01:39.65]I walk over to where you are
[01:44.19]Eye to eye we need no words at all
[01:54.62]Slowly now we begin to move
[01:58.98]Every breath I''m deeper into you
[02:04.13]Soon we two are standing still in time
[02:10.82]If you read my mind, you''ll see
[03:25.70][03:15.57]It''s all brand new, I''m crazy for you
[03:30.62][03:20.20]And you know it''s true
[03:33.17][03:22.83]I''m crazy, crazy for you
