[00:25.11]Sometimes I get impatient
[00:30.87]But she cools me without words
[00:37.51]And she comes so sweet and so plain
[00:44.30]My hummingbird and have you heard
[00:50.21]That I thought my life had ended
[00:57.28]But I find that it's just begun
[01:02.96]Cause she gets me where I live
[01:06.27]I'll give all I have to give
[01:09.85]I'm talking about that hummingbird
[01:15.67]Oh she's little and she loves me
[01:19.23]Too much for words to say
[01:22.13]When I see her in the morning sleeping
[01:28.46]She's little and she loves me
[01:30.63]To my lucky day
[01:34.72]Hummingbird don't fly away
[01:55.89]When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
[02:02.76]She knows the words to say
[02:08.95]And she gives me a little understanding
[02:15.46]In her special way
[02:18.66]And I just have to say
[02:22.26]In my life I loved a woman
[02:27.73]Because she's more than I deserve
[02:34.77]And she gets me where I live
[02:38.19]I'll give all I have to give
[02:41.80]I'm talking about that hummingbird
[02:47.87]Oh she's little and she loves me
[02:50.59]Too much for words to say
[02:54.31]When I see her in the morning sleeping
[03:00.61]She's little and she loves me
[03:03.00]To my lucky day
[03:07.73]Hummingbird don't fly away
