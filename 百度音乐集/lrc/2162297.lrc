[00:00.74]Depeche Mode-Enjoy The Silence(Reinterpreted by Mike Shinoda 2004)
[00:02.92]
[00:04.87]Words like violence
[00:07.02]Break the silence
[00:09.61]Come crashing in
[00:11.03]Into my little world
[00:12.56]
[00:13.37]Painful to me
[00:15.24]Pierce right through me
[00:17.36]Can't you understand
[00:19.42]Oh my little girl
[00:20.92]
[00:21.84]All I ever wanted
[00:23.70]All I ever needed
[00:25.22]Is here in my arms
[00:29.77]Words are very unnecessary
[00:33.73]They can only do harm
[00:42.00]
[00:59.04]Vows are spoken
[01:00.94]To be broken
[01:03.00]Feelings are intense
[01:04.84]Words are trivial
[01:07.16]Pleasures remain
[01:09.20]So does the pain
[01:11.24]Words are meaningless
[01:13.36]And forgettable
[01:14.94]
[01:15.80]All I ever wanted
[01:17.61]All I ever needed
[01:19.18]Is here in my arms
[01:23.78]Words are very unnecessary
[01:28.55]They can only do harm
[01:32.53]
[02:23.96][02:07.33]All I ever wanted
[02:26.30][02:09.44]All I ever needed
[02:27.76][02:10.98]Is here in my arms
[02:32.05][02:15.57]Words are very unnecessary
[02:35.90][02:19.30]They can only do harm
[03:05.69][02:57.64][02:49.12]Enjoy the silence
[03:10.62]...
[03:17.37]
