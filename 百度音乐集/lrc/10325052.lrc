[00:28.21]There's an echo in my head
[00:30.32]Voices loud with what we said
[00:32.46]Here in my mind
[00:36.81]Reach for you
[00:37.71]The beds still warm
[00:38.95]Lonely rooms and empty drawers taking my time
[00:44.35]
[00:45.03]You left my heart
[00:47.03]Your beat My breath
[00:49.30]Your voice My sweat
[00:51.41]Your lies
[00:53.61]My mouth Your touch
[00:55.64]My dreams Your eyes
[00:57.82]Our loss Our lovers Our lives
[01:01.68]
[01:02.70]To think the things I thought before
[01:04.81]Find the laugh you loved and more here by my side
[01:10.29]
[01:10.94]And every time you look behind
[01:15.19]And feel the memory
[01:19.19]Oh it swells in you it swallows me
[01:23.82]And takes our souls to see
[01:27.41]
[01:28.23]And every time you look behind
[01:32.39]And feel what used to be
[01:36.42]Oh it swells in you it swallows me
[01:41.04]And takes your soul to me
[01:45.41]
[02:26.78]Maybe nothing's wrong with giving this away
[02:34.90]Please make up your mind
[02:37.50]Sing all day
[02:39.64]Cry all night
[02:41.48]I drive all day
[02:43.66]Can't sleep all night
[02:46.10]And your feet not on the floor now
[02:50.41]Sing all day
[02:52.51]Cry all night
[02:54.41]Don't drive away
[02:56.63]Be here tonight
[02:59.01]But your key's not in the door tonight
[03:05.60](Not in the door tonight)
[03:10.90]
[03:28.90]And every time you look behind
[03:33.16]And feel the memory
[03:37.07]It swells in you it swallows me
[03:41.79]And takes our souls to see
[03:45.47]
[03:46.16]And every time you look behind
[03:50.42]And feel what used to be
[03:54.33]It swells in you it swallows me
[03:59.01]And takes your soul to me
[04:02.64]
[04:03.74]Takes your soul to me
[04:08.03]Takes your soul to me
[04:11.54]...
