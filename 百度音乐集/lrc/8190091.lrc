[00:05.36]
[00:10.58]There's something happening here
[00:14.00]What it is ain't exactly clear
[00:19.05]There's a man with a gun over there
[00:23.02]Telling me I got to beware
[00:28.03]I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
[00:31.00]Everybody look what's going down
[00:43.86]There's battle lines being drawn
[00:48.00]Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
[00:54.10]Young people speaking their minds
[00:57.29]Getting so much resistance from behind
[01:03.84]I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
[01:05.06]Everybody look what's going down
[01:18.66]What a field-day for the heat
[01:23.95]A thousand people in the street
[01:27.27]Singing songs and carrying signs
[01:31.73]Mostly say, hooray for our side
[01:37.07]It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
[01:42.80]Everybody look what's going down
[01:52.61]Paranoia strikes deep
[01:56.19]Into your life it will creep
[02:01.78]It starts when you're always afraid
[02:05.83]You step out of line, the man come and take you away
[02:07.34]We better stop, hey, what's that sound
[02:10.94]Everybody look what's going down
[02:13.35]Stop, hey, what's that sound
[02:15.33]Everybody look what's going down
[02:18.51]Stop, now, what's that sound
[02:24.21]Everybody look what's going down
[02:26.10]Stop, children, what's that sound
[02:33.62]Everybody look what's going down
