[00:10.71]From night skies dressed in clouds
[00:15.55]Morning came, your taste in my mouth
[00:20.62]I like the way that your hair falls down in your eyes
[00:29.17]And you blush when you smile
[00:32.15]When sleep combs your side then far away flies
[00:38.12]I love the way that you stare when the sleep fills your eyes
[00:46.31]So yesterday has gone
[00:48.75]Who knows, tomorrow may bring all we'll desire
[00:54.15]Tomorrow brings the sun
[01:00.02]Kiss the world with fingers crossed
[01:05.40]I've kissed the world with fingers crossed
[01:09.73]I've been praised
[01:10.78]I've been cursed
[01:12.05]I've been blamed
[01:13.19]And I've won
[01:14.34]And I've lost
[01:24.48]On waves that fill your heart
[01:27.52]The future glides
[01:28.38]I hope the serpents in the tide
[01:30.42]Are all gone
[01:33.60]What's done is done
[01:44.60]A song for no one's in my hand
[01:46.96]A song they'll never understand
[01:50.06]Til I have gone
[01:53.57]And tomorrow brings the sun
