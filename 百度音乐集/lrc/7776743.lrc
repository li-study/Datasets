[00:23.57]
[01:24.25]Temptation-
[01:26.07]Why won't you leave me alone?
[01:29.35]Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go
[01:32.56]
[01:32.83]Self Control-
[01:34.49]Don't turn your back on me now
[01:37.92]When I need you the most
[01:39.16]
[01:41.84]Constant pressure tests my will
[01:46.83]My will or my won't
[01:50.50]My Self Control escapes from me still...
[01:55.15]
[02:26.75]Hypocrite-
[02:28.37]How could you be so cruel
[02:31.88]And expect my faith in return?
[02:35.50]
[02:35.75]Resistance-
[02:36.64]Is not as hard as it seems
[02:39.88]When you close the door
[02:41.54]
[02:44.00]I spent so long trusting in you
[02:48.98]I trust you forgot
[02:52.06]Just when I thought I believed in you...
[02:56.41]
[02:56.92]<Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".>
[02:57.22]"What're you doing?
[02:59.09]What're you doing?"
[02:59.72]
[02:59.93]It's time for me to deal
[03:02.22]Becoming all too real
[03:04.95]Living in fear-
[03:06.40]Why did you lie and pretend?
[03:09.19]This has come to an end
[03:11.90]I'll never trust you again
[03:14.69]It's time you made your amends
[03:19.13]Look in the mirror my friend
[03:21.52]
[03:23.37]<Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".>
[03:23.63]"That I haven't behaved as I should"
[03:24.99]<Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the film "Light Sleeper".>
[03:25.62]"Everything you need is around you.
[03:30.68]The only danger is inside you."
[03:34.42]<Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".>
[03:34.69]"I thought you could control life, but it's not like that..
[03:43.12]There are things you can't control."
[03:44.23]
[03:45.31]Let's stare the problem right in the eye
[03:52.58]It's plagued me from coast to coast
[03:57.02]Racing the clock to please everyone
[04:03.10]All but the one who matters the most
[04:07.90]
[04:09.13]Reflections of reality
[04:14.78]Are slowly coming into view
[04:19.70]How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?
[04:26.90]After all the hell I put you through
[04:32.50]
[04:53.78]It's time for me to deal
[04:56.50]Becoming all too real
[04:59.23]Living in fear-
[05:00.69]Why'd I betray my friend?
[05:03.57]Lying until the end
[05:06.64]Living life so pretend
[05:09.32]It's time to make my amends
[05:13.54]I'll never hurt you again
[05:21.41]
