[00:10.50]A View To A Kill
[00:16.50]
[00:19.50]Meeting you, with a view to a kill,
[00:27.50]Face to face, in secret places. Feel the chill.
[00:41.50]Nightfall covers me,
[00:45.50]But you know, the plans I'm making
[00:48.50]Still over see.
[00:52.50]Could it be the whole earth opening wide
[01:00.50]A sacred why? A myst'ry gaping inside
[01:08.50]The weekends; why? Until we
[01:12.50]dance into the fire,
[01:15.50]That fatal kiss is all we need.
[01:19.50]Dance into the fire
[01:23.50]To fatal sounds of broken dreams.
[01:27.50]Dance into the fire;
[01:30.50]That fatal kiss is all we need.
[01:34.50]Dance into the fire.
[01:42.50]
[01:50.50]The choice for you is the view to a kill.
[01:58.50]Between the shades, assassination standing still.
[02:13.50]The first crystal tears
[02:16.50]Fall as snowflakes on your body,
[02:20.50]First time in years,
[02:24.50]To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain.
[02:31.50]A chance to find a phoenix for the flame,
[02:39.50]A chance to die, but can we
[02:43.50]Dance into the fire,
[02:47.50]That fatal kiss is all we need.
[02:51.50]Dance into the fire
[02:55.50]To fatal sounds of broken dreams.
[02:59.50]Dance into the fire;
[03:03.50]That fatal kiss is all we need.
[03:06.50]Dance into the fire.
[03:10.50]When all we see is a view to a kill.
