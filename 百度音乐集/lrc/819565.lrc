[00:01.49]Last night I watched you sleep as you lay there
[00:11.10]I dropped down to my knees and said a prayer
[00:16.49]
[00:19.88]I leaned over softly to kiss your beautiful face
[00:28.48]But I could not cross the ocean of your grace
[00:35.12]
[00:38.18]The moonlight held you aloft a picture of peace
[00:47.14]The only sound was the soft breeze from the east
[00:52.44]
[00:56.11]My heart beat down in my chest
[00:59.16]to the rhythm of your gentle breath
[01:04.84]And the whole world calmed down
[01:10.68]or this moment of rest
[01:13.44]
[01:18.22]Now I'm...I'm standing above you
[01:22.23]trying so hard not to tell you I love you
[01:28.62]And all that I want in this world is you
[01:33.31]
[01:35.92]If you'd only wake up
[01:39.66]you'd know it was true
[01:41.99]
[01:57.84]Oh baby I love you can be so hard to say
[02:07.38]Especially when it's meant in this strong a way
[02:13.11]
[02:15.84]But at this moment
[02:18.16]while you lie asleep I am suddenly free
[02:25.19]And my trembling arms reach out for you
[02:31.55]As if you could see
[02:34.13]
[02:39.00]Now I'm...I'm standing above you
[02:43.85]trying so hard not to tell you I love you
[02:49.13]And all that I want in this world is you
[02:54.18]
[02:56.08]If you'd only wake up
[03:00.41]you'd know it was true
[03:03.06]
[03:05.11]If you'd only wake up
[03:09.20]you'd know it was true
[03:14.01]
