
[01:19.68]Fool enough to almost be it
[01:23.19]Cool enough to not quite see it
[01:27.45]Doomed
[01:32.88]Pick your pocket full of sorrow
[01:36.42]Run away with me tomorrow
[01:40.64]June
[01:45.91]We'll try and ease the pain
[01:52.17]Somehow we'll feel the same
[01:58.37]Well, no one knows
[02:05.92]Where our secrets go
[02:12.48]I send a heart to all my dearies
[02:16.03]When your life is so, so dreary
[02:20.22]Dream
[02:25.43]I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
[02:29.25]While the harlots of my perils
[02:33.42]Scream
[02:38.50]And I fail
[02:44.44]But when I can, I will
[02:51.92]Try to understand
[02:57.55]The way I can, I will
[03:31.39]Mother weep the years I'm missing
[03:34.99]All our time can't be given
[03:39.26]Back
[03:44.57]Shut my mouth and strike the demons
[03:48.21]Cursed you and your reasons
[03:51.52]Out of hand and out of season
[03:54.44]Out of love and out of feeling
[03:57.74]So bad
[04:03.43]When I can, I will
[04:10.89]Words defy the plans
[04:16.59]When I can, I will
[04:24.08]Fool enough to almost be it
[04:27.64]Cool enough to not quite see it
[04:30.69]Tall enough to always feel it
[04:34.13]Always older, I'll always feel this
[04:37.29]No more promise no more sorrow
[04:40.99]No longer will I follow
[04:43.89]Can anybody hear me
[04:47.10]I just want to be me
[04:56.01]When I can, I will
[05:03.42]Try to understand
[05:09.02]The way I can, I will
