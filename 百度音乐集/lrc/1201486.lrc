[00:27.00]alone i have started my journey
[00:34.73]to the darkness of darkness i go
[00:41.00]with a reason i stopped for a moment
[00:45.00]in this world full of pleasure so frail
[00:51.00]town after town on i travel
[00:56.00]pass through faces i know and know not
[01:02.45]like a bird in flight sometimes i topple
[01:07.30]time and time again just farewells
[01:12.70]Donde voy  donde voy
[01:18.28]Day by day my story unfolds
[01:23.57]Solo estoy solo estoy
[01:29.03]All alone as the day i was born.
[01:36.00]Till you eyes rest in mine i shall wander
[01:42.80]No more darkness i know and know not
[01:48.57]For your sweetness i traded my freedom
[01:53.80]Not knowing a farewell awaits
[01:59.26]You know hearts can be repeatedly broken
[02:04.81]Making roam for the harrows to come
[02:10.12]Along with my sorrows i buried
[02:15.57]my tears  my smiles,your name
[02:20.78]Donde voy, donde voy
[02:26.25]Songs of lovetales i sing of no more
[02:31.64]Solo estoy solo estoy
[02:37.17]Once again with my shadows i roam
[02:42.48]Donde voy  donde voy
[02:48.12]All alone as the day i was born
[02:53.61]Solo estoy solo estoy
[02:58.93]Still alone with my shadows i roam
[03:04.31]
