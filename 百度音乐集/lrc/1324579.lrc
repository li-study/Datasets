[00:03.09]Bizkit
[00:04.21]
[00:14.04]No one knows what it's like
[00:17.51]To be the bad man
[00:21.39]To be the sad man
[00:25.61]Behind blue eyes
[00:29.82]And no one knows
[00:31.36]What it's like to be hated
[00:37.09]To be faded to telling only lies
[00:45.27]But my dreams they aren't as empty
[00:53.24]As my conscious seems to be
[01:01.18]I have hours, only lonely
[01:08.64]My love is vengeance
[01:12.33]That's never free
[01:21.83]No one knows what its like
[01:24.88]To feel these feelings
[01:28.76]Like i do, and i blame you!
[01:37.72]No one bites back as hard
[01:41.20]On their anger
[01:44.74]None of my pain woe
[01:48.87]Can show through
[01:52.99]But my dreams they aren't as empty
[02:00.96]As my conscious seems to be
[02:08.93]I have hours, only lonely
[02:16.51]My love is vengeance
[02:20.14]That's never free
[02:28.68]Discover l.i.m.p. say it.....
[03:01.68]No one knows what its like
[03:04.67]To be mistreated, to be defeated
[03:13.24]Behind blue eyes
[03:17.55]No one know how to say
[03:21.08]That they're sorry and don't worry
[03:28.75]I'm not telling lies
[03:32.80]But my dreams they aren't as empty
[03:40.85]As my conscious seems to be
[03:48.56]I have hours, only lonely
[03:56.28]My love is vengeance
[04:00.13]That's never free
[04:09.58]No one knows what its like
[04:12.88]To be the bad man, to be the sad man
[04:21.03]Behind blue eyes.
