[00:07.55]Sometimes you konw you push me so hard,
[00:10.97]I don't konw how I  feel
[00:12.50]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[00:14.70]you almost make me doubt I feel at all
[00:17.78]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[00:20.47]It's not as though I always listen,
[00:23.54]But there's just so much   I  don't hear
[00:27.31]Maybe I'll  never be what you want
[00:37.22]I know that all you 're  asking for
[00:38.49]Is a little place in my  heart
[00:41.73]But I  don't  find  it  easy  to give
[00:53.39]Maybe I  get a little  selfish  sometimes
[00:57.42]why  shouldn't  I
[01:00.24]I used to say I love  you
[01:04.39]But  would  it make a difference  this time
[01:16.37]And who am I  to tell you that I  would  never let you  down
[01:20.67]That no-one else could love you half as much as I  do now
[01:24.22]And who am I  to tell you  I'll always catch you when you fall
[01:28.01]well I, I  wouldn't  be myself at all
[01:31.96]I wouldn't  be myself at all,at all
[01:39.63]I always find a reason why I  didn't  put you first
[01:44.30]It's not that complicated  I  konw
[01:48.51]I  really hate it when you shake your head,like this ain't gonna work
[01:52.42]Maybe you'll never reap what you sow
[01:59.27]And who am I  to tell you that I  would  never let you  down
[02:02.31]That no-one else could love you half as much as I  do now
[02:04.17]And who am I  to tell you  I'll always catch you when you fall
[02:08.44]well I, I  wouldn't  be myself at all
[02:12.23]I wouldn't  be myself at all,at all
[02:15.05]I  didn't want to do what everybody does
[02:18.06]And hide the truth,to find we never knew a thing about love
[02:20.02]Cos this is real life,real love
[02:23.91]And knowing what it comes down to
[02:25.13]It just might be enough
[02:28.29]And who am I  to tell you that I  would never let you down
[02:39.10]That no-one else could love you half as much as I do now
[02:43.00]And who am I  to tell you I'll always catch you when you fall
[03:35.44]Well I ,I wouldn't be myself at all
[04:03.46]I wouldn,t be myself at all,at all
