
[00:02.00]Come on
[00:08.00]Ooh yeah
[00:18.00]Never be the same again
[00:26.00]I call you up whenever things go wrong
[00:32.00]You're always there
[00:33.00]You are my shoulder to cry on
[00:38.00]I can't believe it took me so long
[00:43.00]To take the forbidden step
[00:46.00]Is this something that I might regret
[00:50.00](Come on come on)
[00:53.00]Novthing ventured nothing gained
[00:56.00](You are the one)
[00:59.00]A lonely heart that can't be tamed
[01:02.00](Come on come on)
[01:05.00]I'm hoping that you feel the same
[01:09.00]This is something that I can't forget
[01:14.00]I thought that we would just be friends
[01:17.00]Things will never be the same again
[01:20.00]It's just the beginning it's not the end
[01:23.00]Things will never be the same again
[01:26.00]It's not a secret anymore
[01:29.00]Now we've opened up the door
[01:31.00]Starting tonight and from now on
[01:35.00]We'll never, never be the same again
[01:42.00]Never be the same again
[01:50.00]Now I know that we were close before
[01:56.00]I'm glad I realised I need you so much more
[02:02.00]And I don't care what every one will say
[02:08.00]It's about you and me
[02:10.00]And we'll never be the same again
[02:14.00]I though that we would just be friends(Oh yeah)
[02:16.00]Things will never be the same again
[02:20.00]It's just the beginnning it's not the end
[02:22.00](We've only just begun)
[02:23.00]Things will never be the same again
[02:26.00]It's not a secret anymore
[02:29.00]Now we've opened up the door(Opened up the door)
[02:32.00]Starting tonight and from now on
[02:35.00]We'll never never be the same again
[02:42.00]Never be the same again
[02:48.00]Nite and day
[02:50.00]Black beach sand to red clay
[02:51.00]The US to UK
[02:53.00]NYC to LA
[02:54.00]From sidewalks to highways
[02:56.00]See it'll never be the same
[02:57.00]What I'm sayin' my mind frame never changed til you
[03:00.00]came and rearranged
[03:01.00]But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
[03:04.00]To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden
[03:07.00]When there's no comptetiton
[03:09.00]And you render my condition
[03:10.00]Though improbable it's not impossible
[03:12.00]For a love that could be unstoppable
[03:13.00]But wait
[03:14.00]A fine line's between fate and destiny
[03:16.00]Do you belive in the things that were just meant to be?
[03:19.00]When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
[03:22.00]Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly and
[03:25.00]As our energies mix and begin to mulitply
[03:28.00]Everyday situations
[03:29.00]They start to simplfy
[03:31.00]So things will never be the same between you and I
[03:34.00]We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified
[03:38.00]I thought that we would just be friends
[03:41.00]Things will never be the same again
[03:44.00]It's just the beginning it's not the end
[03:46.00]Things will never be the same again
[03:53.00]Now we've opened up the door
[03:55.00]Starting tonight and from now on
[03:59.00]We'll never never be the same again(Come on come on)
[04:04.00]Things will never be the same again
[04:08.00](You are the one)
[04:12.00]Never be the same again....(repeat)
[03:50.00]It's not a secret anymore
[04:18.00]Never be the same again....(repeat)
[04:14.00]It's not a secret anymore
[04:20.00]It's not a secret anymore
[04:24.00]Never be the same again....(repeat)
[04:29.00]Never be the same again....(repeat)
