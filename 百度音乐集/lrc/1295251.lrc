[00:09.99]David Archuleta
[00:10.84]
[00:12.30]I hang up the phone tonight
[00:15.08]Something happened for the first time
[00:18.01]Deep inside
[00:19.17]It was a rush, what a rush
[00:22.05]
[00:24.21]Cause the possibility
[00:26.90]that you would ever feel the same way
[00:29.83]About me
[00:30.99]It's just too much, just too much
[00:35.00]
[00:35.51]Why do I keep running from the truth
[00:38.48]All I ever think about is you
[00:41.31]You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
[00:44.68]And I just got to know
[00:47.72]Do you ever think
[00:49.12]When you're all alone
[00:50.62]All that we can be
[00:52.07]Where this thing can go
[00:53.68]Am I crazy or falling in love
[00:56.55]Is it really just another crush
[00:59.70]Do you catch a breath
[01:01.03]When I look at you
[01:02.48]Are you holding back
[01:03.88]Like the way I do
[01:05.53]Cause I'm tryin, tryin to walk away
[01:08.40]But I know this crush aint goin away, goin away
[01:21.75]
[01:23.48]Has it ever cross you mind
[01:26.20]When were hangin, spending time girl
[01:28.80]Are we just friends
[01:30.35]Is there more, is there more
[01:34.98]See it's a chance we've gotta take
[01:37.74]Cause I believe that we can make this into
[01:41.43]Something that will last, last forever, forever
[01:46.96]Do you ever think
[01:48.37]When you're all alone
[01:49.88]All that we can be
[01:51.32]Where this thing can go
[01:52.91]Am I crazy or falling in love
[01:56.03]Is it really just another crush
[01:58.93]Do you catch a breath
[02:00.22]When I look at you
[02:01.70]Are you holding back
[02:03.38]Like the way I do
[02:04.74]Cause I'm tryin, tryin to walk away
[02:07.87]But I know this crush aint goin away,
[02:15.47]goin away
[02:20.99]
[02:22.36]Why do I keep running from the truth
