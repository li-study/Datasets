[00:16.34]Duran Duran
[00:25.07]
[00:34.98]So come the evening
[00:38.16]I＇m out on the dunes
[00:41.10]Looking for a token, something to prove
[00:45.30]All I remember, is more than a flame
[00:51.28]In my fantasy fire
[00:56.38]Whatever I＇ve done to receive
[01:01.07]Whatever I need to redeem
[01:06.24]Whatever you say
[01:09.16]Even if I wait a lifetime
[01:16.28]I know, I swear
[01:21.86]If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
[01:28.47]I＇ll come there
[01:32.11]You can leave a light on for me
[01:37.53]~~~~~~
[01:46.55]In comes the morning
[01:49.59]I＇m stirred in my track
[01:52.53]Looking at the reasons for me to head back
[01:56.74]So unexpected
[01:59.85]The kindness you showed
[02:02.79]That I will not forget it
[02:07.56]Whatever I＇ve done to receive
[02:12.66]Whatever I need to redeem
[02:17.81]Whatever you say
[02:20.91]Even if I wait a lifetime
[02:27.90]I know, I swear
[02:33.40]If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
[02:40.03]I＇ll come there
[02:43.60]You can leave a light on for me
[02:48.52]~~~~~~
[02:58.60]You breathe the will into the we
[03:04.03]And coax the cage back two-by-three
[03:08.73]You ease the lost cause out of me
[03:13.90]With your sweet hand to bring me home
[03:21.35]I＇m not alone Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[03:27.34]Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[03:32.15]Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[03:37.30]Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[03:41.81]I know, I swear
[03:47.39]If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
[03:54.04]I＇ll come there
[03:57.61]You can leave a light on for me
[04:02.11]I know, I swear
[04:07.90]If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
[04:14.52]I＇ll come there
[04:18.07]You can leave a light on for me
[04:24.31]...END...
