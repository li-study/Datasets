[00:02.00]I am so high, I can hear heaven
[00:10.14]I am so high, I can hear heaven
[00:19.20]Whoa, but heaven...no, heaven don’t hear me
[00:28.75]And they say    That a hero could save us
[00:33.12]I’m not gonna stand here and wait
[00:37.28]I’ll hold onto the wings of the eagles
[00:43.21]Watch as we all fly away
[00:50.10]Someone told me
[00:53.63]Love would all save us
[00:58.91]But, how can that be
[01:03.46]Look what love gave us
[01:08.37]A world full of killing
[01:11.35]And blood spilling    That world never came
[01:17.23]And they say    That a hero could save us
[01:21.12]I’m not gonna stand here and wait
[01:26.74]I’ll hold onto the wings of the eagles
[01:31.14]Watch as we all fly away
[01:38.49]Ah
[01:55.09]Now that the world isn’t ending
[01:58.47]It’s love that I’m sending to you
[02:04.00]It isn’t the love of a hero
[02:08.50]And that’s why I fear it won’t do
[02:13.76]And they say    That a hero could save us
[02:17.80]I’m not gonna stand here and wait
[02:23.38]I’ll hold onto the wings of the eagles
[02:27.32]Watch as we all fly away
[02:33.16]And they’re watching us
[02:35.98]They’re watching us    As we all fly away
[02:43.97]And they’re watching us
[02:45.65]They’re watching us    As we all fly away
[02:53.12]And they’re watching us
[02:55.33]They’re watching us    As we all fly away
