[01:11.16]Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
[01:18.41]Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
[01:25.46]Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
[01:32.32]Dance me to the end of love
[01:39.89]Dance me to the end of love
[01:47.72]Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
[01:54.16]Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
[02:01.56]Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
[02:06.46]Dance me to the end of love
[02:16.12]Dance me to the end of love
[02:37.85]Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
[02:45.95]Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
[02:51.92]We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
[02:59.21]Dance me to the end of love
[03:04.95]Dance me to the end of love
[03:14.59]Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
[03:21.18]Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
[03:28.27]Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
[03:35.43]Dance me to the end of love
[04:26.52]Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
[04:33.69]Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
[04:40.69]Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
[04:48.04]Dance me to the end of love
[04:55.27]Dance me to the end of love
[05:02.44]Dance me to the end of love
