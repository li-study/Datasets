[00:12.36]There's a place I've been lookin' for
[00:18.12]That took me in and out of buildings
[00:21.35]Behind windows, walls and doors
[00:23.77]And I thought I found it
[00:26.78]Couple times, even settled down
[00:30.40]And I'd hand around just long enough
[00:33.28]To find my way back out
[00:36.50]I know now the place that I was trying to reach
[00:45.03]Was you, right here in front of me
[00:46.75]
[00:47.27]CHORUS
[00:47.72]And I wouldn't change a thing
[00:50.16]I'd walk right back through the rain
[00:53.28]Back to every broken heart
[00:56.09]On the day that it was breaking'
[00:58.75]And I'd retrieve all the years
[01:01.68]And be thankful for the tears
[01:04.85]I've cried with every stumbled step
[01:07.83]That led to you and got me here, right here
[01:21.54]It's amazing what I let my heart go through
[01:27.62]To get me where it got me
[01:29.98]In this moment here with you
[01:33.00]And it passed me by
[01:35.85]God knows how many times
[01:39.50]I was so caught up in holding
[01:42.39]What I never thought I'd find
[01:45.58]I know now, there's a million roadsI had to take
[01:52.67]To get me in your arms that way
[01:53.89]
[01:55.60]And I wouldn't change a thing
[01:58.34]I'd walk right back through the rain
[02:01.31]Back to every broken heart
[02:04.16]On the day that it was breakin'
[02:06.98]And I'd retrieve all the years
[02:09.93]And be thankful for the tears
[02:13.03]I've cried with every stumbled step
[02:16.05]That led to you and got me here, right here
[02:21.08]In a love I never thought I'd get to get to here
[02:28.66]And if that's the road God made me take to be with you
[02:39.31]And I wouldn't change a thing
[02:40.50]I'd walk right back through the rain
[02:43.35]Back to every broken heart
[02:46.19]On the day that it was breakin'
[02:48.99]And I'd retrieve all the years
[02:51.69]And be thankful for the tears
[02:55.13]I've cried with every stumbled step
[02:57.94]That led to you and got me here, right here
[03:12.65]And I'd retrieve all the years
[03:15.44]And be thankful for all the tears
[03:18.58]I've cried with every stumbled step
[03:21.72]That led to you and got me here, right here
[03:33.63]Oh, baby-Ooo
[03:43.47]Oh, got me here
