[00:22.00]A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
[00:29.00]An airline ticket to romantic places
[00:37.00]Still my heart has wings
[00:42.00]These foolish things remind me of you.
[00:51.00]A tinkling piano in the next apartment
[00:59.00]Those stumblin'words
[01:03.00]That told you what my heart meant
[01:07.00]A fair ground painted swings
[01:13.00]These foolish things remind me of you.
[01:22.00]You came, you saw, you conquered me
[01:37.00]When you did that to me
[01:44.00]I knew somehow this had to be
[01:52.00]Win the marks
[01:54.00]And make my heart a dancer
[02:00.00]A telephone that rings
[02:03.00]But who's to answer
[02:08.00]Oh, how the ghost of you clings
[02:13.00]These foolish things remind me of you
