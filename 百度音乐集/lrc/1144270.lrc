[00:07.50]Bee Gees
[00:14.00]I can think of younger days when living for my life
[00:21.00]Was everything a man could want to do
[00:26.00]I could never see tomorrow
[00:33.50]but I was never told about the sorrow
[00:41.00]And how can you mend a broken heart?
[00:51.00]How can you stop the rain from falling down?
[00:57.00]How can you stop the sun from shining?
[01:04.00]What makes the world go round?

[01:18.00]How can a loser ever win?
[01:24.00]Please help me mend my broken heart
[01:33.00]and let me live again
[01:42.00]I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
[01:49.00]And misty memories of days gone by
[01:56.00]We could never see tomorrow

[02:11.05]and how can you mend a broken heart?
[02:21.00]How can you stop the rain from falling down?
