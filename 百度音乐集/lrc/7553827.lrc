[00:00.00]Sitting On Top Of The World
[00:04.00]Worlds Apart
[00:08.00]
[00:14.94]Sometimes when I was lost
[00:18.12]And feeling so alone never did I ever think of letting go
[00:28.24]The world was closing in
[00:31.48]And when I thought I couldn't win
[00:35.83]You were there to pull me throught into the light
[00:39.98]Light of your love
[00:45.81]And you raised my soul, up above
[00:51.88]And now I know, now I know
[00:57.20]
[00:57.90]I'm sitting on top of the world
[01:01.34]Standing on the edge of the sky
[01:04.61]Holding on to my dreams
[01:07.95]Watching the world go by
[01:10.95]Living in the light of the sun
[01:14.51]Has shown me how to believe
[01:17.46]That I can do anything
[01:20.75]When you're with me
[01:24.41]
[01:27.16]I've travelled many roads
[01:30.61]And I guess that now I know
[01:35.23]That is love that makes the world go round and round
[01:40.52]The things you gave to me, have shown me what it means
[01:48.33]To climb higher up and realise the love that's inside
[01:58.19]Gave me reason to feel alive
[02:04.32]And now I know, in my heart
[02:09.89]
[02:10.42]I'm sitting on top of the world
[02:13.84]Standing on the edge of the sky
[02:17.17]Holding on to my dreams
[02:20.51]Watching the world go by
[02:23.67]Living in the light of the sun
[02:26.98]Has shown me how to believe
[02:29.96]That I can do anything
[02:33.07]When you're with me
[02:37.52]
[02:39.47]Heaven on this earth is what you've given me
[02:45.94]You have shown me how to fly
[02:51.35]And now my eyes can see
[02:54.35]How your love has set me free
[02:58.23]With you by my side
[03:01.13]Together we can climb
[03:04.37]
[03:06.58]Standing on the edge of the sky
[03:09.96]Holding on to my dreams
[03:13.15]Watching the world go by
[03:16.33]Living in the light of the sun
[03:19.76]Has shown me how to believe
[03:22.76]That I can do anything
[03:26.17]When you're with me
[03:29.66]I'm sitting on top of the world
[03:32.62]And as far as I can see
[03:36.28]That I can do anything
[03:39.13]When you're with me
