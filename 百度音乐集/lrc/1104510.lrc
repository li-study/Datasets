[00:02.28]Girl in your dreams
[00:05.68]张靓颖
[00:09.17]
[00:11.11]Looking for places
[00:14.12]Where nothing reminds me of you
[00:21.06]To stop me from thinking
[00:24.09]About everything we used to do
[00:27.65]
[00:31.10]Did you give me everything just to take it again?
[00:35.61]I thought that I was more than your friend
[00:39.50]
[00:39.78]You told me I was the one that you needed
[00:45.20]And that I was the girl of your dreams
[00:49.80]Every word that you said I believed in
[00:55.83]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[00:59.39]
[00:59.94]You made me see far beyond up the rainbow
[01:04.59]You made my soul want to reach for the stars
[01:09.90]Every word that you said I believed in
[01:15.75]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[01:19.93]Nothing at all
[01:24.59]
[01:31.07]Breaking the promise
[01:34.58]That I didn’t know how you’d kept
[01:40.35]Cause every time I got stronger
[01:44.02]You wanted me to be weak
[01:47.64]
[01:50.70]So you gave me everything just to take it again
[01:55.75]I thought that I was more than your friend
[01:59.53]
[01:59.81]You told me that I was the one that you needed
[02:04.73]And that I was the girl of your dreams
[02:09.88]Every word that you said I believed in
[02:15.98]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[02:19.32]
[02:19.71]You made me see far beyond up the rainbow
[02:24.69]You made my soul want to reach for the stars
[02:29.85]Every word that you said I believed in
[02:35.83]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[02:39.80]Nothing at all
[02:41.94]
[02:42.15]You told me I was the one that you needed
[02:46.39]Every word that you said, oh, I believed in
[02:51.34]So why you wanted to leave me like before
[02:53.90]And leave me all alone
[02:56.50]Without a sound, without a clue
[02:58.68]Tired of thinking of you…
[03:01.50]
[03:05.74]You told me I was the one that you needed
[03:09.80]And that I was the girl of your dreams
[03:14.94]Every word that you said I believed in
[03:20.88]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[03:24.24]
[03:24.64]You made me see far beyond up the rainbow
[03:29.51]You made my soul want to reach for the stars
[03:34.76]Every word that you said I believed in
[03:40.70]Now I am standing here with nothing at all
[03:48.54]Yes I am standing here with nothing at all
