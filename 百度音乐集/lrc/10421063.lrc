[00:02.82]Oahhh
[00:05.35]Yeah
[00:10.20]No
[00:16.02]Yeah yeah yeah
[00:21.13]Once upon a time
[00:23.48]You whispered softly in my ear
[00:27.07]Loving words and fairytales
[00:29.63]That I longed to hear
[00:32.59]I gave you my body and soul
[00:35.08]And you took control
[00:37.37]As you slowly swept me up
[00:40.06]And carried me away
[00:42.53]You told me pretty lies
[00:49.74]As I held onto you tight
[00:55.27]You knew how to get your way
[00:57.94]Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace
[01:03.09]Long ago
[01:06.98]You used to want me
[01:12.14](Now it’s all so far away)
[01:13.76]Now it’s all so far away
[01:16.79]But you still haunt me
[01:20.53]And take me back to yesterday
[01:23.27]Every now and then
[01:24.75]I drown in thoughts of yesterday
[01:28.40]And the fools’ paradise that you blew away
[01:34.00]I feel you beside me again
[01:36.46]And remember when you came to my window
[01:40.61]On a dark and stormy day
[01:44.11]Baby, I need you now
[01:51.17]Tonight I’m crumbling down (down)
[01:56.72]Sinking in the memories
[01:59.29]Shadows of you keep washing over me
[02:04.47]Long ago
[02:08.31]You used to want me
[02:13.48](Now it’s all so far away)
[02:15.85]Now it’s all so far away
[02:18.64]But you still haunt me
[02:25.52]Long ago
[02:29.37]You used to want me
[02:34.51](Now it’s all so far away)
[02:36.14]Now it’s all so far away
[02:40.15]But you still haunt me
[02:43.69]And take me back to yesterday
[02:47.49](So long ago)
[02:50.06](So long ago)
[02:52.63](So long ago)
[02:55.11](So long ago)
[02:57.68](So long ago)
[03:00.30](So long ago)
[03:02.92](So long ago)
[03:06.52]Oh baby, I need you now
[03:14.38]’Cause tonight I’m crumbling down
[03:19.73]Sinking in the memories
[03:22.79]Shadows of you keep washing over me
[03:27.65]Long ago
[03:31.49]You used to want me
[03:36.67](Now it’s all so far away)
[03:37.90]Now it’s all so far away
[03:41.74]But you still haunt me
[03:45.59]And take me back to yesterday
[03:48.29]Long ago
[03:51.75]You used to want me
[03:56.88](Now it’s all so far away)
[03:58.57]Now it’s all so far away
[04:01.88]But you still haunt me
[04:08.46]Long ago
[04:12.29]You used to want me
[04:17.47](Now it’s all so far away)
[04:18.74]Now it’s all so far away
[04:22.71]But you still haunt me
