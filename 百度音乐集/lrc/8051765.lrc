[00:14.20]
[00:42.94]No more talk of darkness
[00:46.10]Forget these wide-eyed fears
[00:50.24]I'm here, nothing can harm you
[00:54.47]My words will warm and calm you
[00:59.55]Let me be your freedom
[01:04.13]Let daylight dry your tears
[01:08.14]I'm here, with you, beside you
[01:11.78]To guard you and to guide you
[01:17.19]
[01:18.07]Say you'll love me every waking moment
[01:27.45]Turn my head with talk of summertime
[01:37.44]Say you need me with you now and always
[01:46.49]Promise me that all you say is true
[01:55.83]That's all I ask of you
[02:01.18]
[02:01.41]Let me be your shelter
[02:04.54]Let me be your light
[02:08.68]You're safe, no one will find you
[02:11.98]Your fears are far behind you
[02:17.56]All I want is freedom
[02:20.65]A world with no more night
[02:24.14]And you, always beside me
[02:28.09]To hold me and to hide me
[02:32.40]Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
[02:40.54]Let me lead you from you solitude
[02:48.76]Say you need me with you here，beside you
[02:58.96]Anywhere you go, let me go too
[03:06.88]Christine, that's all I ask of you
[03:11.41]
[03:11.78]Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
[03:20.53]Say the words and I will follow you
[03:29.40]Share each day with me, each night, each morning
[03:39.42]Say you love me
[03:42.85]You know I do
[03:48.22]Love me, that's all I ask of you
[03:56.94]
[04:20.67]Anywhere you go, let me go too
[04:32.53]Love me
[04:35.04]That's all I ask of you
