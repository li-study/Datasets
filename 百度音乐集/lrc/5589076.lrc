[00:16.61]It’s close to mornin
[00:18.96]And can’t I see your face
[00:22.66]How’d we end up this way
[00:26.73]You were the sun in every day
[00:30.20]You’d take my soul
[00:32.62]Everytime you’d go
[00:36.04]But this time I know
[00:40.68]The truth is in your heart, we’re dead and gone
[00:43.05]I know you’re tired of broken promises
[00:47.39]I had too many ‘second chances’
[00:50.81]I’m a lost man for you, will I ever break through?
[00:56.18]
[00:57.33]I’m still in love (still in love, but)
[01:00.76]She’s thinking of (everyone, but)
[01:04.14]The very one (I should move on, but)
[01:07.42]Who’s still in love
[01:10.36]I’m still in love (still in love, but)
[01:13.98]She’s thinking of (everyone, but)
[01:17.45]The very one (I should move on, but)
[01:20.87]Who’s still in love
[01:23.39]
[01:23.91]I just can’t stand to think
[01:29.36]What my days will be
[01:33.85]Without you by my side, I just can’t breathe
[01:37.78]It don’t matter what they say
[01:42.08]I know nobody, can ever take your place
[01:49.57]I know you’re tired of broken promises
[01:53.94]I had too many ‘second chances’
[01:57.66]I’m a lost man for you, will I ever break through?
[02:04.01]I’m still in love (still in love, but)

[02:57.18]It’s painful that everyone knows
[03:01.90]It’s so true
[03:04.42]I’m nothing but a fool for you
[03:09.41]But I don’t care, I’ll always be here
[03:16.48]Loving you with all I got
[03:19.39]I don’t care if you love me or not
[03:23.49]
