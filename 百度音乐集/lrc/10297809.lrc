[00:01.50]作词：Lionel Richie　作曲：Lionel Richie
[00:15.85]I've been alone with you inside my mind
[00:24.20]And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
[00:31.32]I sometimes see you pass outside my door
[00:38.59]Hello, is it me you're looking for
[00:46.63]I can see it in your eyes
[00:50.10]I can see it in your smile
[00:53.80]You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
[01:01.85]Cause you know just what to say and you know just what to do
[01:10.02]And I want to tell you so much,
[01:16.32]I love you
[01:20.32]
[01:30.80]I long to see the sunlight in your hair
[01:38.68]And tell you time and time again, how much I care
[01:46.77]Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
[01:54.18]Hello, I've just got to let you know
[02:01.99]Cause I wonder where you are
[02:05.26]and I wonder what you do
[02:09.77]Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
[02:16.68]Tell me how to win your heart for I haven't got a clue
[02:25.44]But let me start by saying,
[02:29.99]I love you
[02:34.30]
[03:08.93]Hello, is it me you're looking for
[03:16.80]Cause I wonder where you are
[03:21.24]and I wonder what you do
[03:24.77]Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
[03:32.61]Tell me how to win your heart for I haven't got a clue
[03:40.56]But let me start by saying,
[03:46.30]I love you
[03:51.50](The End)
