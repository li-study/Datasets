[00:16.64]Do you understand?
[00:20.00]This might be the perfect start
[00:23.80]Something pure in you
[00:27.40]No more late night television hours
[00:34.35]Or sleepless mornings
[00:38.95]I'm looking forward to the change
[00:45.20]
[00:46.65]I imagine this
[00:49.07]I imagine that
[00:50.49]Never really follow through
[00:54.35]Why don't I do this?
[00:56.46]Why don't I do that?
[00:58.10]No one understands my intentions
[01:06.42]No one ever understands me
[01:08.89]
[01:23.79]Why can't I ever be the one to follow

[01:35.22]The attention I need
[01:35.96]The attention that I miss
[01:37.92]Well I would like to
[01:41.65]
[01:45.36]I imagine this
[01:47.74]I imagine that
[01:49.52]Never really follow through
[01:53.30]Why don't I do this?
[01:54.96]Why don't I do that?
[01:56.92]No one understands my intentions
[02:05.49]No one ever understands me
