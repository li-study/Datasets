[00:02.00]Hinder - Without You
[00:04.00]
[00:07.26]I just want to be alone tonight
[00:10.53]I just want to take a little breather
[00:13.98]Cause lately all we do is fight
[00:17.51]And every time it cuts me deeper
[00:21.13]Cause something changed you've been acting so strange
[00:24.53]And it's taking its toll on me
[00:27.90]It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave
[00:34.21]Without you I live it up a little more everyday
[00:40.74]Without you I'm seeing myself so differently
[00:48.03]I didn't wanna believe it then
[00:51.70]But it all worked out in the end
[00:55.78]When I watched you walk away
[00:57.53]Well I never thought I'd say I'm fine without you
[01:06.57]
[01:10.59]Called you up cause it's been long enough
[01:14.15]And you said that you were so much better
[01:17.75]We have done a lot of growing up
[01:21.02]We were never meant to be together
[01:24.72]Cause something changed you've been acting so strange
[01:27.37]And it's taking it's toll on me
[01:30.79]It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave
[01:37.29]Without you I live it up a little more everyday
[01:44.02]Without you I'm seeing myself so differently
[01:51.33]I didn't wanna believe it then
[01:55.20]But it all worked out in the end
[01:59.23]When I watched you walk away
[02:01.14]Well I never thought I'd say I'm fine without you
[02:10.80]
[02:20.53]Cause something changed you've been acting so strange
