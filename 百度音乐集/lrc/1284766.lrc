[00:00.00]Katie Melua - I Cried for You
[00:14.66]
[00:16.66]You're beautiful so silently
[00:19.84]It lies beneath a shade of blue
[00:23.62]It struck me so violently
[00:27.20]When I looked at you
[00:30.08]
[00:31.89]But others pass, the never pause
[00:35.12]To feel that magic in your hand
[00:39.58]To me you're like a wild rose
[00:42.91]They never understand why
[00:47.09]
[00:47.92]I cried for you
[00:51.41]When the sky cried for you
[00:55.54]And when you went
[00:56.96]I became a hopeless drifter
[01:02.85]But this life was not for you
[01:07.07]Though I learned from you
[01:11.02]That beauty need only be a whisper
[01:16.29]
[01:18.29]I'll cross the sea for a different world
[01:24.89]With your treasure, a secret for me to hold
[01:31.36]
[01:33.63]In many years they may forget
[01:36.76]This love of ours or that we met
[01:40.76]They may not know
[01:42.58]How much you meant to me
[01:47.09]
[01:49.69]I cried for you
[01:53.05]And the sky cried for you
[01:57.19]And when you went
[01:58.68]I became a hopeless drifter
[02:04.30]But this life was not for you
[02:08.76]Though I learned from you
[02:12.52]That beauty need only be a whisper
[02:17.94]
[02:19.76]Without you now I see
[02:22.90]How fragile the world can be
[02:31.46]And I know you've gone away
[02:34.74]But in my heart you'll always stay
[02:46.15]
[02:47.43]I cried for you
[02:50.87]And the sky cried for you
[02:55.01]And when you went
[02:56.55]I became a hopeless drifter
[03:02.25]But this life was not for you
[03:06.59]Though I learned from you
[03:10.42]That beauty need only be a whisper
[03:16.70]That beauty need only be a whisper
[03:23.99]
