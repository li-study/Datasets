[00:00.00]Lene Marlin - Fight Against The Hours
[00:19.70]
[00:21.70]I'm here, sitting in a bed
[00:34.11]In a place where I don't feel at home
[00:42.07]Where are you, I sure wonder why
[00:52.22]You haven't called me, you promised you would
[01:05.22]The phone must be broken it has to be broken
[01:15.73]I'm sure there's a reason, say there's a reason
[01:23.99]
[01:27.61]I fight against the hours, I cannot go to sleep
[01:38.05]I know that if I lay down now,
[01:43.41]Inside I know I'll weep
[01:48.40]Guess I'm holding on to treasures
[01:53.98]To things that just aren't there
[01:59.21]To people that I used to know,
[02:04.48]To words I wish to hear.
[02:08.26]
[02:09.76]I'm here, thinking only of you
[02:22.44]Wish to know, if I need to go
[02:30.09]And I try, I swear to you that I try
[02:40.35]But you haven't called me, you promised you would
[02:53.49]The phone must be broken, it has to be broken
[03:04.03]I'm sure there's a reason, say there's a reason
[03:12.19]
[05:22.50][04:40.28][03:15.93]I fight against the hours, I cannot go to sleep
[05:33.05][04:50.72][03:26.33]I know that if I lay down now,
[05:38.28][04:56.12][03:31.87]Inside I know I'll weep
[05:43.14][05:00.93][03:36.56]Guess I'm holding on to treasures
[05:48.79][05:06.63][03:42.18]To things that just aren't there
[05:54.12][05:11.87][03:47.47]To people that I used to know,
[05:59.36][05:17.16][03:52.64]To words I wish to hear.
[06:02.81][05:21.04][03:56.20]
[04:18.01]I'm thinking about you, wondering about you
[04:28.40]Do I really know you, have I ever known you
