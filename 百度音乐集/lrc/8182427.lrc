[00:00.00]Maroon 5
[00:10.83]Through With You
[00:25.93]Can you see me
[00:27.63]Floating above your head
[00:29.44]As you lay in bed
[00:31.15]Thinking about everything
[00:32.85]That you did not do
[00:34.66]Cause saying I love you
[00:36.18]Has nothing to do with meaning it
[00:39.51]...
[00:45.73]And I don't trust you
[00:47.68]Cause every time you're here
[00:49.03]Your intentions are unclear
[00:50.58]I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
[00:53.84]That I know will never come
[00:55.64]I used to think you were the one
[00:57.15]Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
[00:59.62]You ain't ever coming back to me
[01:02.28]That's not how things were supposed to be
[01:06.08]You take my hand just to give it back
[01:09.00]No other lover has ever done that
[01:12.10]Do you remember
[01:13.91]The way we used to melt
[01:15.46]Do you remember how it felt
[01:17.05]When I touched you
[01:18.51]Oh cause I remember very well
[01:22.17]Oh Oh
[01:24.14]And how long has it been
[01:25.30]Since someone you let in
[01:26.91]Has given what I gave to you?
[01:29.50]...
[01:30.47]And at night when you sleep
[01:31.93]Do you dream I would be there
[01:33.80]Just for a minute or two do you?
[01:36.96]You ain't ever coming back to me
[01:40.16]That's not how things were supposed to be
[01:43.48]You take my hand just to give it back
[01:46.77]No other lover has ever done that
[01:49.89]Heartache heartache I just have so much
[01:53.40]A simple love with a complex touch
[01:56.61]There is nothing you can say or do
[01:59.97]I called to let you know I'm through with you
[02:04.58]...
[02:24.25]You ain't ever coming back to me
[02:27.36]That's not how things were supposed to be
[02:30.71]You take my hand just to give it back
[02:33.84]No other lover has ever done that
[02:37.20]Heartache heartache I just have so much
[02:40.49]A simple love with a complex touch
[02:43.46]There is nothing you can say or do
[02:46.70]I called to let you know I'm through
[02:50.92]I called to let you know I'm through
[02:53.52]I called to let you know I'm through with you
[02:57.49]I ain't never coming back to you
