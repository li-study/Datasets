[00:08.54]Sometimes I wonder
[00:10.25]How I'd ever make it through,
[00:13.56]Through this world without having you
[00:17.60]I just wouldn't have a clue
[00:23.08]'Cause sometimes it seems
[00:24.93]Like this world's closing in on me,
[00:28.21]And there's no way of breaking free
[00:32.14]And then I see you reach for me
[00:36.68]Sometimes I wanna give up
[00:39.05]I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
[00:43.31]And then I see you, baby
[00:46.89]And everythin~s airight, everything's airight
[00:55.29]When I see you smile
[00:59.98]I can face the world, oh oh, you know I can do anything
[01:08.80]When I see you smile
[01:14.01]I see a ray of light, oh oh, I see it shining right through the rain
[01:22.16]When I see you smile
[01:25.73]Oh yeah, baby when I see you smile at me
[01:37.47]Baby there's nothing
[01:39.17]in this world that could ever do
[01:42.46]What a touch of your hand can do
[01:45.90]It's like nothing that I ever knew
[01:49.92]And when the rain is falling
[01:53.29]I don't feel it, 'cause you're here with me now
[01:58.17]And one look at you baby
[02:00.43]Is ali I'll ever need, you're all rll ever need
[02:04.84]Sometimes I wanna give up
[02:08.89]When I see you smile
[02:14.05]I can face the world, oh oh, you know I can do anything
[02:23.17]When I see you smile
[02:28.07]I see a ray of light, oh oh, I see it shining right through the rain
[02:36.56]Oh yeah, baby when I see you smile at me
[02:37.20]When I see you smile
[02:44.25]Sometimes I wanna give up
[02:46.87]I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
[02:51.82]And then I see you baby
