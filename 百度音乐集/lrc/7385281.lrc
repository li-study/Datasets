[00:05.89]
[00:15.42]Seems like I knew you since you
[00:17.72]were a little girl
[00:21.18]Cried out to you, never thought
[00:23.35]that you'd ruin my world
[00:26.95]Now we're all broke up
[00:28.59]I glimpse you on the street
[00:32.55]Just gotta put up, shut up,
[00:34.97]Because we've split the sheets
[00:37.03]
[00:38.71]This world keeps spinning around
[00:40.87]but I just don't care
[00:44.27]I had my name written up in lights
[00:46.61]wanted you to share

[00:52.97]yours yourself

[01:07.46]So long to my lover
[01:13.41]And though we never made it
[01:16.09]I've still got to say it
[01:19.17]I can't stand any other
[01:23.54](and there's no-one to hold me)
[01:25.06]
[01:26.20]Got your letter just yesterday
[01:31.31]So you might as well get outta here
[01:33.69]Because you been paid
[01:37.19]It doesn't matter cos I've got my lover
[01:39.74]And she's into me
[01:43.07]But I'm finding it hard inside to set
[01:46.01]you free
[01:47.50]

[01:54.34]So long to my lover
[02:00.33]And though we never made it
[02:02.95]I've still got to say it
[02:06.01]I can't stand any other
[02:10.35](and there's no-one to hold me)
[02:12.47]
[02:12.96]Keeping all the hearts you get to break
[02:18.75]I've got another lover who loves mistakes
[02:24.59]I never get close enough to touch
[02:29.14]'Cos you're cool when you're burning

[02:57.19](and there's no-one to hold me)
[02:58.69]
[02:59.16]Now I pretend
[03:01.57]That I don't care
[03:04.33]But I'm a lonely man
[03:07.29]And I'm running scared
[03:09.39]
[03:10.56]It's over now
[03:12.79]So baby walk away
[03:16.25]It's broken down
[03:18.87]It won't work again

[03:22.64]
