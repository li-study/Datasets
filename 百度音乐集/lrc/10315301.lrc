[00:19.04]I'm standing in the station
[00:22.02]I'm waiting for a train
[00:25.39]To take me to the border
[00:28.62]And my loved one far away
[00:32.07]I watched a bunch of soldiers
[00:34.95]Heading for the war
[00:38.54]I could hardly even bear to see them go
[00:44.47]
[00:45.31]Rolling through the countryside
[00:48.47]Tears are in my eyes
[00:51.84]We're coming to the borderline
[00:55.14]I'm ready with my lies
[00:58.40]And in the early morning rain
[01:01.46]I see her there
[01:04.72]And I know I'll have to say goodbye again
[01:09.62]
[02:59.86]And it's breaking my heart
[03:03.54]I know what I must do
[03:06.93]I hear my country call me
[03:09.25]But I want to be with you
[03:13.21]I'm taking my side
[03:16.51]One of us will lose
[03:19.69]Don't let go, I want to know
[03:23.71]That you will wait for me until the day ----
[04:15.35]There's no borderline, no borderline
[03:45.55]
[02:16.23]Walking passed the border guards
[02:19.28]Reaching for her hand
[02:22.55]Showing no emotion
[02:25.48]I want to break into a run
[02:29.15]But these are only boys
[02:32.19]And I will never know
[02:35.78]How men can see the wisdom in a war
[02:42.42]
[03:00.52]And it's breaking my heart
[03:04.64]I know what I must do
[03:07.90]I hear my country call me
[03:10.28]But I want to be with you
[03:14.20]I'm taking my side
[03:17.48]One of us will lose
[03:20.69]Don't let go, I want to know
[03:23.50]That you will wait for me until the day ----
[03:31.82]There's no borderline, no borderline
[03:48.75]
[04:15.86]There's no borderline, no borderline
[04:31.30]
