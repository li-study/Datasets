[00:19.43]I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
[00:23.93]I've never seen you shine so bright
[00:32.03]I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
[00:36.42]They're looking for a little romance,
[00:40.02]given half a chance
[00:44.41]And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
[00:47.28]Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
[00:53.18]I have been blind
[00:55.49]The lady in red
[01:01.47]is dancing with me,
[01:05.63]cheek to cheek
[01:08.35]There's nobody here,
[01:14.24]it's just you and me
[01:18.01]It's where I want to be
[01:20.64]But I hardly know
[01:26.51]this beauty by my side
[01:33.03]I'll never forget
[01:39.22]the way you look tonight
[01:53.30]I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
[01:57.70]I've never seen you shine so bright,
[02:01.90]you were amazing
[02:05.76]I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
[02:09.89]And when you turned to me and smiled,
[02:13.36]it took my breath away
[02:17.67]And I have never had such a feeling
[02:20.40]Such a feeling of complete and utter love,
[02:26.48]as I do tonight
[02:28.91]The lady in red
[02:34.68]is dancing with me,
[02:39.02]cheek to cheek
[02:41.74]There's nobody here,
[02:47.64]it's just you and me
[02:51.28]It's where I want to be
[02:53.56]But I hardly know
[02:59.81]this beauty by my side
[03:06.47]I'll never forget
[03:12.60]the way you look tonight
[03:19.05]I'll never forget
[03:23.96]the way you look tonight
[03:31.85]Lady in red
[03:37.47]Lady in red
[03:43.68]Lady in red
[03:49.88]my lady in red
