[00:40.06]It wasn't raining yet
[00:42.54]But it was definitely a little misty on
[00:45.53]That warm November night
[00:50.30]And my heart was pounding
[00:52.64]My inner voice resounding
[00:55.41]Begging me to turn away
[00:57.93]But I just had to see your face
[01:00.22]To feel alive
[01:02.80]And then you casually walked in the room
[01:07.73]And I was twisted in the web
[01:10.36]Of my desire for you
[01:13.70]My apprehension blew away
[01:15.70]I only wanted you
[01:17.97]To taste my sadness
[01:20.13]As you kissed me in the dark
[03:40.79][01:24.06]Everytime I feel the need
[03:50.04][01:25.72]I envision you caressing me
[03:53.42][01:30.59]And go back in time
[03:55.86][01:33.58]To relieve the splendor of you and I
[01:38.71]On the rooftop that rainy night
[01:40.62]And so we finished the Moet and
[01:43.69]I started feeling liberated
[01:46.37]And I surrendered as you took me
[01:48.67]In your arms
[01:50.78]I was so caught up in the moment
[01:56.23]I couldn't bear to let you go yet
[01:59.58]So I threw caution to the wind
[02:02.15]And started listening to my longing heart
[02:06.44]And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
[02:09.40]And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
[02:10.98]For such a long time
[02:13.43]And for a while I forgot
[02:15.89]The sorrow and the pain
[02:18.49]And melted with you as we stood
[02:21.06]There in the rain
[03:03.33]Last night I dreamed that I
[03:07.90]Whispered the words I love you
[03:12.88]And touched you so very
[03:17.36]Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
