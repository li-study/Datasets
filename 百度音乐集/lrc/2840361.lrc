[02:24.55][00:58.86]I awake
[01:05.22]From blood thick dreams
[01:11.57]Washing blame
[01:17.51]From my knees
[01:23.85]Softly done
[01:29.46]So secretly
[01:35.52]I'm awake
[01:41.45]As Charlie sleeps
[04:24.55][03:14.01][01:48.08]A lone brother
[04:30.53][03:20.38][01:55.21]A lone sister

[03:32.53][02:07.03]Alone
[02:30.64]Dry the scream
[02:36.63]Spit the vile breath
[02:41.52]'Till my tongue bleeds
[02:49.13]Thinks it's all gone
[02:54.93]Famously

[03:06.91]Good to please
[04:03.34][03:46.68][03:41.53]Tell it like it is
[03:52.52]Tell the sordid truth
[04:08.57][03:57.69]Tell them
[04:42.96]Alone, alone
[04:55.85]Alone, alone, yeah.
