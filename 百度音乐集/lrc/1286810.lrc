[00:13.19]oh oh oh oh oh oh oooah
[00:16.12]oh oh oh oh oh oh oooah
[00:19.32]oh oh oh oh oh oh oooah
[00:22.33]oh oh oh oh oh oh oooah
[00:25.62]
[00:26.07]It started with a low light
[00:28.34]Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
[00:32.43]And then they took my blood type
[00:35.39]It left a strange impression in my head
[00:38.60]You know that I was hoping
[00:41.77]That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
[00:44.91]But when they cut me open
[00:48.08]I guess I changed my mind
[00:50.37]And you know I might
[00:53.78]Have just flown too far from the floor this time
[00:59.92]'cause they calling me by my name!
[01:03.18]And the zipping white light beams
[01:05.21]disregards the bombs and satellites!
[01:09.23]
[01:10.71]That was the turning point
[01:13.99]That was one lonely night!
[01:16.41]
[01:16.72]The song maker says "It ain't so bad"
[01:19.59]The dream maker's going make you mad
[01:22.80]The spaceman says "Everybody look down!
[01:25.83]Its all in your mind!"
[01:27.79]
[01:29.16]Well now I'm back at home and-
[01:31.65]I’m looking forward to this life I live
[01:35.55]You know its gonna haunt me
[01:38.51]So hesitation to this life I give
[01:41.76]You think you might cross over
[01:44.75]You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
[01:48.14]You better look it over
[01:51.05]Before you make that leap!
[01:53.11]
[01:53.61]And you know I'm fine but I hear those voices at night
[02:01.02]sometimes they justify my claim
[02:06.34]and the public don’t ground my transmission
[02:09.57]'cause it wasn’t televised
[02:12.42]
[02:13.71]But it was the turning point
[02:17.04]Oh what a lonely night!
[02:19.45]
[02:19.81]The song maker says "It ain't so bad"
[02:22.74]The dream maker's going make you mad
[02:26.01]The spaceman says "Everybody look down!
[02:28.87]Its all in your mind!"
[02:31.09]
[02:32.18]The song maker says "It ain't so bad"
[02:35.41]The dream maker's going make you mad
[02:38.34]The spaceman says "Everybody look down!
[02:41.67]Its all in your mind!"
[02:43.75]
[02:57.83]My global position systems are vocally addressed
[03:04.09]They say the Nile used to run from east to west
[03:10.36]They say the Nile used to run… from east to west
[03:16.94]I'm fine but I hear those voices at night
[03:23.61]sometimes
[03:25.81]
[03:28.98]The song maker says "It ain't so bad"
[03:32.23]The dream maker's going make you mad
[03:35.50]The spaceman says "Everybody look down!
[03:38.55]Its all in your mind!"
[03:41.65]The song maker says "It ain't so bad"
[03:45.01]The dream maker's going make you mad
[03:48.21]The spaceman says "Everybody look down
[03:52.04]Its all in your mind!"
[03:56.07]
[04:05.72]It's all in my mi-i-ind
[04:12.19]It's all in my mind
[04:14.30]oh oh oh oh oh oh oooah
