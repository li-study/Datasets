[00:02.43]Joni Mitchell - Come In From The Cold
[00:05.54]
[00:16.24]Back in 1957
[00:18.76]We had to dance a foot apart
[00:24.43]And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
[00:29.82]Holding their rulers without a heart
[00:36.61]And so with just a touch of our fingers
[00:40.38]I could make our circuitry explode
[00:47.23]All we ever wanted
[00:51.99]Was just to come in from the cold
[00:55.55]Come in
[00:55.77]
[00:58.80]Come in from the cold
[01:02.13](we were so young)
[01:04.98]Oh come in
[01:07.31]Come in from the cold
[01:10.59]
[01:12.00]We really thought we had a purpose
[01:15.91]We were so anxious to achieve
[01:22.62]We had hope
[01:27.38]The world held promise
[01:27.81]For a slave to liberty
[01:35.45]Freely I slaved away for something better
[01:40.35]And I was bought and sold
[01:44.90]And all I ever wanted
[01:49.66]Was just to come in from the cold
[01:53.11]
[01:55.56]Come in
[01:56.88]Come in from the cold
[02:00.72](we were so sure)
[02:02.34]Oh come in
[02:05.05]Come in from the cold
[02:08.77]
[02:09.67]I feel your leg under the table
[02:15.72]Leaning into mine
[02:20.26]I feel renewed
[02:23.28]I feel disabled
[02:25.58]By these bonfires in my spine
[02:31.94]I dont know who the arsonist was
[02:37.94]Which incendiary soul
[02:42.57]But all I ever wanted
[02:47.59]Was just to come in from the cold
[02:50.95]
[02:53.22]Come in
[02:54.52]Come in from the cold
[02:57.61](you were so warm)
[02:59.68]Oh come in
[03:02.65]Come in from the cold
[03:05.70]
[03:07.44]I am not some stone commission
[03:12.38]Like a statue in a park
[03:17.96]I am flesh and blood and vision
[03:22.91]I am howling in the dark
[03:29.73]Long blue shadows of the jackals
[03:33.61]Are falling on a pay phone by the road
[03:40.08]Oh all they ever wanted
[03:45.03]Was just to come in from the cold
[03:48.57]
[03:50.89]Come in
[03:51.80]Come in from the cold
[03:54.73](I was so low)
[03:57.08]Oh come in
[04:00.26]Come in from the cold
[04:03.64]
[04:05.09]Is this just vulgar electricity
[04:09.65]Is this the edifying fire
[04:12.35](it was so pure)
[04:15.05]Does your smiles covert complicity
[04:21.38]Debase as it admires
[04:25.67](just a flu with a temperature)
[04:27.50]Are you just checking out your mojo
[04:31.16](oohoo)
[04:31.77]Or am I just fighting off growing old
[04:35.29](just a high fever)
[04:39.41]All I ever wanted
[04:42.64]Was just to come in from the cold
[04:46.23]
[04:46.77]Come in
[04:49.06]Come in from the cold
[04:52.29](it was so pure)
[04:54.98]Oh come in
[04:58.27]Come in from the cold
[05:00.79]
[05:02.80]I know we never will be perfect
[05:08.47]Never entirely clear
[05:12.18](when the moon shines)
[05:14.89]We get hurt and we just panic
[05:18.41]And we strike out
[05:20.56]Out of fear
[05:23.27](you were only being kind)
[05:25.04]I fear the sentence of this solitude
[05:30.57]200 years on hold
[05:34.33](for my loving crime)
[05:35.57]Oh and all we ever wanted
[05:40.36]Was just to come in from the cold
[05:43.79]
[05:44.19]Come in
[05:46.73]Come in from the cold
[05:49.72](when the moon shines)
[05:52.69]Oh come in
[05:55.59]Come in from the cold
[05:58.37]
[06:00.44]When I thought life had some purpose
[06:05.42]Then I thought I had some choice
[06:08.60](I was running blind)
[06:11.78]And I made some value judgments
[06:16.18]In a self-important voice
[06:20.02](I was outa line)
[06:22.65]But then absurdity came over me
[06:27.43]And I longed to lose control
[06:32.01](into no mind)
[06:33.18]Oh all I ever wanted
[06:38.13]Was just to come in from the cold
[06:41.61]
[06:41.95]Come in
[06:44.58]Come in from the cold
[06:47.88](you were so kind)
[06:50.49]Please come in
[06:51.91](so kind)
[06:53.39]Come in from the cold
[06:55.63]Come in come in
[06:56.95]Come in from the cold, etc
