[00:05.22]Song: Stranger in My House
[00:09.67]Album: 40 N1 Hits
[00:13.09]
[00:36.04]There's a silence here between us
[00:40.10]I've never heard before
[00:44.41]And I can't find the love
[00:48.74]In her eyes anymore
[00:52.96]There's some changes going on
[00:57.02]I'm beginning to understand
[01:01.60]When I'm holding her
[01:04.29]I swear I feel the presence of another man
[01:09.32]
[01:09.94]Chorus:
[01:10.61]There's a stranger in my house
[01:14.30]Somebody here that I can't see
[01:19.27]Stranger in my house
[01:23.39]Somebody here trying to take her away from me
[01:30.21]
[01:35.37]She sits staring out the window
[01:40.63]A million miles away
[01:44.77]And when I ask if she's all right
[01:49.41]She never has too much to say
[01:53.27]Is it somebody we both know
[01:57.65]Or somebody she just met
[02:01.91]Is she loving him in her mind
[02:06.48]While she's lying here in my bed
[02:10.62]
[02:11.17]There's a stranger in my house
[02:15.41]Somebody here that I can't see
[02:19.83]Stranger in my house
[02:24.12]Somebody here trying to take her away from me
[02:31.83]
[03:02.82]Suspicions lead to questions
[03:07.24]And questions to alibis
[03:11.37]Is it just my imagination
[03:15.62]Or has her love turned into lies
[03:19.89]
[03:20.31]There's a stranger in my house
[03:24.20]Somebody's here that I can't see
[03:29.09]Stranger in my house
[03:32.99]Somebody here trying to take her away
[03:37.92]Stranger in my house
[03:42.16]Somebody's here that I can't see
[03:46.44]Stranger in my house
[03:50.82]Somebody here trying to take her away
[03:55.13]Stranger in my house
[03:59.53]Somebody here trying to take her away from me
