[00:21.40]I am a vision, I am justice
[00:25.88]Never thought that I could love
[00:29.24]Living in shadows, faded existence
[00:33.67]It was never good enough
[00:37.19]Within the darkness, you are the light
[00:42.06]That shines away
[00:45.31]You’re trapped in violence, I can be the man
[00:50.13]Who saves the day
[00:54.79]I’m there for you
[00:58.86]No matter what
[01:02.14]I’m there for you
[01:07.58]Never giving up
[01:10.23]I’m there for you
[01:17.39]For you
[01:19.14]Someone has changed me, something saved me
[01:23.28]Now this is who I am
[01:26.83]Although I was blinded, my heart let me find that
[01:31.35]Truth makes a better man
[01:34.82]I didn’t notice that you were right in front of me
[01:42.83]A mask of silence, we’ll put away so we can see
[01:51.60]I’m there for you
[01:56.60]No matter what
[01:59.75]I’m there for you
[02:04.69]Never giving up
[02:08.07]I’m there for you
[02:14.31]For you
[02:37.00]Within the darkness, you are the light
[02:41.97]That shines away
[02:44.94]In this blind justice, I can be the man
[02:49.85]Who saves the day
[02:54.95]I’m there for you
[02:58.99]No matter what
[03:02.03]I’m there for you
[03:07.45]Never giving up
[03:10.75]You know it’s true
[03:15.47]You were there for me
[03:18.97]And I’m there for you
[03:25.10]For you
[03:29.12]For you
[03:32.13]For you
