[00:34.49]Our friends think we're opposites
[00:39.12]Falling in and out of love
[00:43.91]That all said we'd never last
[00:48.36]Still we manage to stay together
[00:53.05]There's no easy explanation for it
[00:57.67]But whenever there's a problem
[01:01.03]We always work it out somehow
[01:06.99]Work it out somehow
[01:10.84]That said it wouldn't last
[01:13.18]We had to prove them wrong
[01:15.31]'cause I've learned in the past
[01:17.69]That love will never do without you
[01:29.03]Other guys have tried before
[01:33.46]To replace you as my lover
[01:38.12]Never did I have a doubt
[01:42.78]Boy it's you I can't do without
[01:47.33]I feel better when I have you near me
[01:51.99]'cause no other love around
[01:54.67]Has quite the same ooh ooh
[02:01.30]Like you do do do do baby
[04:00.39][02:05.17]That said it wouldn't last
[04:02.71][02:07.44]We had to prove them wrong
[04:04.99][02:09.87]'cause I've learned in the past
[04:07.33][02:21.85][02:12.07]That love will never do without you
[02:28.32][02:19.05]do without you
