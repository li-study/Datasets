[00:00.00]Green Day - Viva La Gloria!
[00:07.29]Hey Gloria
[00:09.71]Are you standing close to the edge?
[00:14.10]Lookout to the setting sun
[00:17.60]The brink of your vision
[00:21.02]Eternal youth is
[00:23.38]A landscape of the lie
[00:27.75]The cracks of my skin can prove
[00:31.23]As the years will testify
[00:34.70]Say your prayers and light a fire
[00:38.24]We're going to start a war
[00:41.75]Your slogans a gun for hire
[00:45.21]It's what we waited for
[00:50.39]Hey Gloria,
[00:52.90]This is why we're on the edge
[00:57.37]The fight of our lives been drawn to
[01:00.53]This undying love.
[01:08.61]Gloria, Viva La Gloria
[01:13.92]You blast your name
[01:15.76]In graffiti on the walls
[01:19.56]Falling through broken glass that's
[01:21.97]Slashing through yuor spirit
[01:24.61]I can hear it like a jilted crowd
[01:29.84]Gloria, where are you Gloria
[01:35.24]You found a home
[01:36.58]In all your scars and ammunition
[01:40.58]You made your bed in salad days
[01:43.49]Amongst the ruin
[01:45.90]Ashes to ashes of our youth
[01:51.22]She smashed her knuckles into winter
[01:56.76]As autumns wind fades into black
[02:02.25]She is the saint on all the sinners
[02:07.79]The one that's fallen through the cracks
[02:12.78]So don't put away your burning light
[02:18.73]Gloria, where are you Gloria
[02:24.15]Don't lose your faith
[02:26.15]To your lost naivete
[02:29.20]Weather the storm and don't look
[02:31.80]Back on last November
[02:34.83]When your banners were burning down
[02:40.02]Gloria, viva la Gloria
[02:45.44]Send me your amnesty down
[02:49.05]To the broken hearted
[02:52.03]Bring us the season
[02:53.65]That we always will remember
[02:57.39]Don't let the bonfires go out
[03:02.17]So Gloria,
[03:05.30]Send out your message of the light
[03:08.06]That shadows in the night.
[03:13.58]Gloria, where's your undying love?
[03:19.21]Tell me the story of your life
[03:23.72]Your life...
