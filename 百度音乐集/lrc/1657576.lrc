[00:02.29]I'm awake in the afternoon
[00:03.93]I fell asleep in the living room
[00:07.48]and it's one of those moments
[00:10.47]when everything is so clear
[00:15.15]before the truth goes back into hiding
[00:18.41]I want to decide 'cause it's worth deciding
[00:21.91]to work on finding something more than this fear
[00:29.03]It takes so much out of me to pretend
[00:36.22]tell me now, tell me how to make amends
[00:43.49]maybe, I need to see the daylight
[00:48.67]to leave behind this half-life
[00:52.40]don't you see I'm breaking down
[00:57.79]lately, something here don't feel right
[01:02.99]this is just a half-life
[01:06.77]is there really no escape?
[01:10.17]no escape from time
[01:13.84]of any kind
[01:23.53]I keep trying to understand
[01:33.64]this thing and that thing, my fellow man
[01:37.58]but I don't mind a few mysteries
[01:39.84]I guess I'll let you know
[01:40.27]they can stay that way it's fine by me
[01:44.13]but you are another mystery i am missing
[01:44.89]when i figure it out
[01:51.64]It takes so much out of me to pretend
[01:58.71]maybe, I need to see the daylight
[02:03.79]to leave behind this half-life
[02:07.89]don't you see I'm breaking down
[02:12.74]Lately, something here don't feel right
[02:18.25]this is just a half-life
[02:22.19]is there really no escape?
[02:25.65]no escape from time
[02:30.02]of any kind
[02:34.32]come on lets fall in love
[02:39.76]come on lets fall in love
[02:44.96]come on lets fall in love
[02:50.72]again
[02:53.89]'cause lately something here don't feel right
[02:59.40]this is just a half-life,
[03:03.03]without you I am breaking down
[03:08.37]wake me, let me see the daylight
[03:12.14]save me from this half-life
[03:18.68]let's you and I escape
[03:22.40]escape from time
[03:30.38]come on lets fall in love
[03:35.16]come on lets fall in love
[03:40.72]come on lets fall in love
[03:46.70]again
