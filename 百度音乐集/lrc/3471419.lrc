[00:14.66]I'm sick and tired of everybody tryna tell me what to do
[00:22.10]If i'm in need of your advice then surely I would come to you
[00:29.39]I didn't get in this position just by having a stance
[00:36.77]I work my bones beyond my limit just to have half a chance

[00:44.29]It matters how you play the game
[00:47.91]It matters that you can take the pain
[00:51.65]You don't wanna lie, steal or cheat your way to the top ohhh
[00:59.00]It matters what your people think
[01:02.70]You represent your family
[01:06.45]But thats just one more reason to see that it matters
[01:12.77]Whether you win or lose
[01:15.80]

[01:35.92]It seems you've got the throne to beat me as if it's all i takes
[01:43.24]But i've got skills to pay the bills and punish each of your mistakes

[01:54.42]It matters that you can take the pain
[01:58.15]You don't wanna lie, steal or cheat your way to the top ohhh
[02:05.56]It matters what your people think
[02:09.11]You represent your family
[02:12.83]But thats just one more reason to see that it matters

[02:36.57]I see my name in lights
[02:40.41]The people call my name
[02:44.44]It's all up to you
