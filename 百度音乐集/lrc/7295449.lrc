[00:09.00]On the first part of the journey
[00:12.00]I was looking at all the life
[00:16.00]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[00:20.00]There was sand and hills and rings
[00:25.00]The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
[00:28.00]And a sky with no clouds
[00:32.00]The heat was hot and the ground was dry
[00:35.00]But the air was full of sound
[00:40.00]I been through the desert on a horse with no name
[00:44.00]It felt good to be out of the rain
[00:47.00]In the desert you can remember your name
[00:51.00]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[01:11.00]After two days in the desert sun
[01:14.00]My skin began to turn red
[01:19.00]After three days in the desert fun
[01:22.00]I was looking at a riverbed
[01:26.00]And the story it told of a river that flowed
[01:30.00]Made me sad to think it was dead
[01:33.00]You see...
[01:34.00]I been through the desert on a horse with no name
[01:37.00]It felt good to be out of the rain
[01:42.00]In the desert you can remember your name
[01:45.00]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
[02:20.00]After nine days I let the horse run free
[02:24.00]'Cause the desert had turned to sea
[02:28.00]There were plants and birds and rocks and things
[02:32.00]There was sand and hills and rings
[02:36.00]The ocean is a desert with its life underground
[02:39.00]And a perfect disguise above
[02:43.00]Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
[02:48.00]But the humans will give no love
[02:51.00]You see, ...
[02:52.00]I been through the desert on a horse with no name
[02:55.00]It felt good to be out of the rain
[02:59.00]In the desert you can remember your name
[03:02.00]'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
