[00:09.85]On my roof
[00:13.82]Dark & I'm burning a rose
[00:20.07]I don't need proof
[00:24.46]I'm torn apart & you know
[00:30.97]What you did to me was a crime
[00:36.44]Cold Case Love
[00:41.70]& I let you reach me one more time
[00:47.08]But that's enough

[01:56.61]Should've investigated
[02:00.37]But love blinded eyes
[02:02.96]Couldn't see (no)
[02:07.39]& Then I tried to cage it
[02:10.67]But your love ain't the kind you can keep
[02:17.69]Release me now cause I did my time
[02:22.82]Of this cold case love
