[00:01.12]The Who - Behind Blue Eyes
[00:03.13]
[00:08.40]No one knows what it's like
[00:11.76]To be the bad man
[00:15.50]To be the sad man
[00:19.44]Behind blue eyes
[00:21.76]
[00:23.57]No one knows what it's like
[00:26.84]To be hated
[00:30.57]To be fated
[00:33.89]To telling only lies
[00:36.66]
[00:38.00]But my dreams
[00:41.77]They aren't as empty
[00:45.88]As my conscience seems to be
[00:52.16]
[00:53.71]I have hours, only lonely
[01:01.32]My love is vengeance
[01:05.22]That's never free
[01:08.58]
[01:14.05]No one knows what it's like
[01:16.97]To feel these feelings
[01:20.99]Like I do
[01:24.57]And I blame you
[01:27.13]
[01:29.38]No one bites back as hard
[01:32.93]On their anger
[01:36.00]None of my pain and woe
[01:39.94]Can show through
[01:42.71]
[01:43.87]But my dreams
[01:47.43]They aren't as empty
[01:51.52]As my conscience seems to be
[01:57.26]
[01:59.29]I have hours, only lonely
[02:06.33]My love is vengeance
[02:10.92]That's never free
[02:24.77]
[02:27.34]When my fist clenches, crack it open
[02:31.48]Before I use it and lose my cool
[02:35.31]When I smile, tell me some bad news
[02:38.76]Before I laugh and act like a fool
[02:42.64]
[02:45.99]And if I swallow anything evil
[02:49.90]Put your finger down my throat
[02:53.27]And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
[02:56.78]Keep me warm; let me wear your coat
[03:00.67]
[03:21.55]No one knows what it's like
[03:24.75]To be the bad man
[03:28.54]To be the sad man
[03:32.63]Behind blue eyes
[03:38.75]
