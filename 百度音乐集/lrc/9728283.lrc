[00:04.59]Marc Cohn
[00:06.12]
[00:08.64]Put on my blue suede shoes
[00:12.35]And I boarded the plane
[00:14.73]Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
[00:19.19]In the middle of the pouring rain
[00:23.17]W.C. Handy -- won\'t you look down over me
[00:30.16]Yeah I got a first class ticket
[00:33.25]But I\'m as blue as a boy can be
[00:36.05]
[00:36.47]Then I\'m walking in Memphis
[00:40.05]Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
[00:44.04]Walking in Memphis
[00:47.36]But do I really feel the way I feel
[00:53.82]
[00:54.88]Saw the ghost of Elvis
[00:58.03]On Union Avenue
[01:00.70]Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
[01:04.46]Then I watched him walk right through
[01:08.43]Now security they did not see him
[01:11.79]They just hovered \'round his tomb
[01:15.71]But there\'s a pretty little thing
[01:17.80]Waiting for the King
[01:19.76]Down in the Jungle Room
[01:21.21]
[01:21.84]Then I\'m walking in Memphis
[01:25.99]Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
[01:29.89]Walking in Memphis
[01:32.79]But do I really feel the way I feel
[01:37.19]
[01:43.07]They\'ve got catfish on the table
[01:50.59]They\'ve got gospel in the air
[01:57.82]And Reverend Green be glad to see you
[02:03.55]When you haven\'t got a prayer
[02:11.29]But boy you\'ve got a prayer in Memphis
[02:14.49]
[02:20.77]Now Muriel plays piano
[02:24.41]Every Friday at the Hollywood
[02:28.06]And they brought me down to see her
[02:31.33]And they asked me if I would --
[02:35.63]Do a little number
[02:38.60]And I sang with all my might
[02:41.91]And she said --
[02:43.06]\"Tell me are you a Christian child?\"
[02:45.98]And I said \"Ma\'am I am tonight\"
[02:48.68]
[02:49.03]Then I\'m walking in Memphis
[02:52.36]Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
[02:56.18]Walking in Memphis
[02:59.61]But do I really feel the way I feel
[03:02.60]
[03:04.26]Then I\'m walking in Memphis
[03:07.04]Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
[03:10.52]Walking in Memphis
[03:14.09]But do I really feel the way I feel
[03:17.93]
[03:25.24]Put on my blue suede shoes
[03:28.16]And I boarded the plane
[03:31.72]Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
[03:35.97]In the middle of the pouring rain
[03:39.16]Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
[03:46.44]In the middle of the pouring rain
[03:53.67]
