[00:01.20]
[00:07.82]He's all right
[00:08.77]He's all wrong
[00:09.84]He's a player
[00:10.66]He's a dog
[00:11.87]He's my friend
[00:12.95]He's my foe
[00:13.94]I just can't leave him
[00:15.04]I can't go
[00:15.97]I got my reasons
[00:17.00]'Got my pride
[00:18.03]I got these kids
[00:19.18]We got these ties
[00:20.13]We had this love
[00:21.06]I had these dreams
[00:22.13]I'm falling apart at the seems
[00:23.92]
[01:38.75][00:24.36]He's my man when we're at home
[01:40.76][00:26.33]And it can't hurt if I don't know
[01:42.77][00:28.32]All his secrets all his lies
[01:44.88][00:30.44]I just keep pushing 'em out my mind
[01:46.81][00:32.45]I wish that everybody would stop judging
[01:49.77][00:35.02]Pointing fingers its cutting
[01:51.83][00:37.28]My heart is broken
[01:53.25][00:38.69]And no better, feeling so bad
[01:55.91][00:41.49]I gotta make decisions
[01:58.03][00:43.59]I'm strong but who am I kidding
[02:00.07][00:45.59]I'll be okay
[02:01.29][00:46.80]But this love is tearing me in half
[02:03.61][00:48.98]
[03:02.00][02:04.14][00:49.68]Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
[03:09.91][02:12.13][00:57.88]I'm down on my knees and praying for his love
[03:18.49][02:20.06][01:05.60]I'm in love
[03:19.95][02:22.07][01:07.56]I'm still in love
[03:22.06][02:24.21][01:09.63]I just don't think that it's enough
[03:26.20][02:28.32][01:13.83]I can feel it getting colder
[02:32.86][01:18.28]I'm afraid of starting over
[02:36.40][01:21.55]
[01:22.28]He makes me feel like a child
[01:24.22]He makes me happy when he smiles
[01:26.31]He makes me sad
[01:27.35]Makes me mad
[01:28.33]Want to give him all I have
[01:30.38]And I have tried to treat him good
[01:32.49]Show support like I should
[01:34.46]Did my part, he's my heart
[01:36.79]And I've been faithful from the start
[01:38.01]
[02:37.39]Ha, ha, ha, ooh
[02:45.40]To save this life
[02:47.26]We built together
[02:49.56]We need another chance
[02:53.09]It's like my whole life
[02:55.53]And my existence
[02:57.72]He holds in his hands
[03:00.87]
[03:30.83]The time has come for starting over
[03:35.94]
