[00:02.32]Because Of You
[00:04.22]kelly clarkson
[00:05.22]
[00:15.49]I will not make the same mistakes that you did
[00:22.58]I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
[00:29.07]I will not break the way you did
[00:33.57]You fell so hard
[00:35.89]I learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
[00:42.76]Because of you
[00:44.31]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[00:49.52]Because of you
[00:51.13]I learned to play on the safe side
[00:53.72]So I don't get hurt
[00:56.38]Because of you
[00:58.06]I find it hard to trust
[00:59.89]Not only me, but everyone around me
[01:03.55]Because of you
[01:06.71]I am afraid
[01:12.05]I lose my way
[01:14.43]And it's not too long before you point it out
[01:18.88]I cannot cry
[01:21.22]Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
[01:25.82]I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
[01:30.13]Every day of my life
[01:32.62]My heart can't possibly break
[01:35.14]When it wasn't even whole to start with
[01:39.30]Because of you
[01:40.92]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[01:46.09]Because of you
[01:47.61]I learned to play on the safe side
[01:50.37]So I don't get hurt
[01:52.96]Because of you
[01:54.61]I find it hard to trust
[01:56.24]Not only me, but everyone around me
[02:00.07]Because of you
[02:03.30]I am afraid
[02:06.92]I watched you die
[02:08.40]I heard you cry
[02:10.10]Every night in your sleep
[02:13.58]I was so young
[02:15.17]You should have known better than to lean on me
[02:20.44]You never thought of anyone else
[02:23.87]You just saw your pain
[02:27.39]And now I cry
[02:29.11]In the middle of the night
[02:31.10]Over the same damn thing
[02:37.26]Because of you
[02:39.20]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[02:44.53]Because of you
[02:46.15]I learned to play on the safe side
[02:48.54]So I don't get hurt
[02:51.46]Because of you
[02:52.89]I tried my hardest just to forget everything
[02:58.13]Because of you
[02:59.67]I don't know how to let anyone else in
[03:04.90]Because of you
[03:06.71]I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
[03:11.80]Because of you
[03:14.19]I am afraid
[03:19.09]Because of you ...
