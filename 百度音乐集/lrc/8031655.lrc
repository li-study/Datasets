[00:16.27]James-The Morning After
[00:21.42]Dust motes in a beam of light
[00:26.63]It's slow-down time
[00:31.23]Snow flake on a black felt glove
[00:35.83]Melting in the sunlight
[00:41.46]Dust motes in a beam of light
[00:46.77]You left without a fight

[01:07.17]Ooh, I forgive you
[01:15.32]Ooh I forgive you
[01:27.09]I forgive you - your transgressions
[01:42.87]There's a vulture at the end of my bed

[01:55.03]There's a vulture at the end of my bed
[01:59.15]Against my window in silhouette

[03:07.07]Got over my supper - it revived (?)
[03:11.89]Got off the table, started to fly
