[00:18.50]Taking a day at a time
[00:27.50]Dealing with feelings I don't wanna hide
[00:36.50]Learning to love as I go, baby
[00:45.50]Without taking you along for a ride.
[00:54.50]Tried to find myself
[00:56.50]Tried to find the truth
[00:58.50]Get out from this shell
[01:00.50]Girl I'm almost there
[01:06.50]To show you how much I really care.
[01:10.50][02:22.50][03:37.50][04:13.50]If you say goodbye
[01:15.50][02:27.50][03:41.50][04:17.50]There'll be something missing in my life
[01:19.50][02:31.50][03:46.50][04:22.50]'Cause you know
[01:22.50][02:34.50][03:49.50][04:25.50]That all I really (all I really) want is you.
[01:30.50]Sorry if you felt misled
[01:39.50]But I know what I feel, I know what I said, baby
[01:48.50]God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
[01:57.50]The future in us together in love.
[02:06.50]You're the reason I'm strong
[02:08.50]Don't you think I don't know
[02:10.50]This is where I belong
[02:12.50]Give me the time
[02:18.50]To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine.
[02:41.50]If you say goodbye
[02:45.50]There'll be something missing in my life
[02:49.50]'Cause you know
[02:53.50]That all I really (all I really) want is you.
[03:18.50]Tried to find myself
[03:20.50]Tried to find the truth
[03:22.50]Get out from this shell
[03:25.50]Girl I'm almost there
[03:31.50]So let me show you, so let me show you.
[03:55.50]If you say goodbye
[03:59.50]There'll be something missing in my life
[04:04.50]'Cause you know
[04:07.50]That all I really (all I really) want is you.
