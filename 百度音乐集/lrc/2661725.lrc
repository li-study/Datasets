[00:24.88]make:silence (snail)
[00:29.22]I was childish and unfair
[00:35.54]To you, my only friend
[00:42.35]I regret, but now it's too late
[00:54.85]I can't show you any more
[00:59.05]The things I've learned from you
[01:04.81]Cause life just took you away
[01:15.42]I'm asking why
[01:21.03]I'm asking why
[01:26.68]Nobody gives an answer
[01:31.90]I'm just asking why
[01:41.15]But someday we'll meet again
[01:46.75]And I'll ask you
[01:50.87]I'll ask you why
[01:54.34]Why it has to be like this
[02:00.42]I'm asking you why
[02:06.27]Please give me an answer
[02:16.04]Many years and stupid fights
[02:21.61]Till we accept to see
[02:27.29]How it was and it'll always be
[02:39.21]Why it has to be like this
[02:45.05]Why we don't realize
[02:51.46]Why we're too blind to see the one
[02:57.48]Who's always on our side
[03:00.95]I'm asking why
[03:06.48]I'm asking why
[03:11.98]Nobody gives an answer
[03:17.45]I'm just asking why
[03:24.26]Just tell me why Why it has to be like this
[03:33.70]That the good ones disappear
[03:41.26]I'm asking you why
[03:47.72]I'm asking why
[03:53.49]I'm asking why
[03:58.97]Nobody gives an answer
[04:04.38]I'm just asking why
[04:11.12]I'm asking why...
[04:35.16]... ...
