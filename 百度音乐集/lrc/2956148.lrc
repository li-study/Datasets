[00:08.54]
[00:18.01]I feel the heat around me
[00:19.81]I feel the beat surrounds me
[00:21.84]Could this be for real, I wonder
[00:26.04]No need for hesitation
[00:27.91]It’s time for celebration
[00:30.59]Will this be the night I’ve waited for
[00:34.21]When angels fall in love
[00:37.54]Heaven knows, does it show, oh
[00:42.34]If this love, will last for eternity
[00:47.76]Set me on fire
[02:48.83][02:32.32][02:17.40][01:43.19][00:50.40]I believe, I believe in love
[02:51.56][02:35.37][01:46.34][00:53.33]And like the stars above
[02:54.07][02:37.61][01:48.71][00:55.72]They shine, let it shine over me
[02:56.71][02:40.35][01:51.45][00:58.58]Set me free I believe in you
[02:59.73][02:43.29][01:54.34][01:01.29]And that our love is true
[03:06.18][03:02.16][02:46.03][01:57.08][01:04.10]Oh I believe, I believe
[01:10.93]I see that people dancing
[01:12.89]Boys and girls romancing
[01:15.22]They want this to last forever
[01:19.02]Cause underneath the moonlight
[01:21.10]Everything is alright
[01:23.65]We’re reaching our hands up in the air
[01:27.06]To where the souls alive
[01:30.54]Heaven knows, that it shows oh
[01:35.24]If this love, will last for eternity
[01:40.68]Set me on fire
[01:59.63]How could I doubt, what was meant to be
[02:03.12]Everything I needed was in front of me
[02:07.78]Your healing touch, will lift me up in the sky, so high
