[00:12.82]Have no fear in your heart
[00:26.19]Though you feel you've been broken and lost
[00:41.72]There's a place where we will meet up again
[00:54.67]There's a place that mends your hurt and takes you in
[01:03.63]
[01:09.45]There are times faced alone
[01:22.66]When you find all the holes in yourself
[01:38.02]You don't have to walk the night on your own
[01:50.45]I will say a prayer for you to lead you on
[02:04.14]I will say a prayer for you when you have gone
[02:14.29]
