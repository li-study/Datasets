[00:03.64]Eric Johnson
[00:04.56]
[00:11.42]Desert Rose that dances, in the heat of the sky,
[00:16.56]I must pattern my life about you;
[00:21.90]You can make the most when the waters run dry,
[00:27.16]Look into the well deep inside you.
[00:30.40]
[00:31.20]My Desert Rose,
[00:35.69]Born are the few;
[00:41.31]Always with me,
[00:46.20]A vision of you.
[00:50.95]
[00:53.02]Acrolith reflection, that floats through my dreams,
[00:58.13]Arid is the dust underneath me;
[01:03.48]Something far away, a mirage so it seems,
[01:08.93]What I long to see, oh, could it be?
[01:12.20]
[01:12.30]My Desert Rose,
[01:18.16]Born are the few;
[01:22.94]Always with me,
[01:27.84]A vision of you.
[01:34.74]
[02:36.15]My Desert Rose,
[02:41.19]Born are the few;
[02:45.95]Always with me,
[02:52.12]A vision of you.
[02:56.82]My Desert Rose,
[03:01.74]Born are the few;
[03:07.22]Always with me,
[03:12.82]A vision of you.
[03:15.27]
[03:17.00]So don't fade away.
[03:20.73]
[04:47.00]Don't fade away.
