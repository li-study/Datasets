[00:36.00]You only see what your eyes want to see
[00:40.00]How can life be what you want it to be
[00:44.00]You're frozen when your heart's not open
[00:54.00]You're so consumed with how much you get
[00:58.00]You waste your time with hate and regret
[01:01.00]You're frozen when your heart's not open
[01:11.00]Mmm-mm-mm... If I could melt your heart
[01:19.00]Mmm-mm-mm... We'd never be apart
[01:29.00]Mmm-mm-mm... Give yourself to me
[01:37.00]Mmm-mm-mm... You are the key
[01:55.00]Now there's no point in placing the blame
[02:00.00]And you should know I'd suffer the same
[02:04.00]If I lose you, my heart would be broken
[02:13.00]Love is a bird, she needs to fly
[02:18.00]Let all the hurt inside you die
[02:21.00]You're frozen when your heart's not open
[02:31.00]Mmm-mm-mm... If I could melt your heart
[02:39.00]Mmm-mm-mm... We'd never be apart
[02:48.00]Mmm-mm-mm... Give yourself to me
[02:57.00]Mmm-mm-mm... You are the key
[03:51.00]You only see what your eyes want to see
[03:55.00]How can life be what you want it to be
[03:59.00]You're frozen when your heart's not open
[04:08.00]Mmm-mm-mm... If I could melt your heart
[04:17.00]Mmm-mm-mm... We'd never be apart
[04:26.00]Mmm-mm-mm... Give yourself to me
[04:35.00]Mmm-mm-mm... You are the key
[04:44.00]Mmm-mm-mm... If I could melt your heart
[04:53.00]Mmm-mm-mm... We'd never be apart
[05:02.00]Mmm-mm-mm... Give yourself to me
[05:10.00]Mmm-mm-mm... You are the key
