[00:18.62]The sun is going down on me
[00:23.95]As she surrenders to the sea
[00:27.38]So steal the night and fly with me
[00:30.76]I'm calling, I'm calling
[00:36.39]The moon is high on me and you
[00:40.81]Is my message breaking through
[00:45.72]Darkened skies that once
[00:48.84]Were blue are falling
[00:52.02](So hear me now)
[00:53.80]Calling out your name
[00:56.62]Burning on the flame
[01:02.93]Played the waiting game
[01:06.95]Hear my calling
[01:09.08]Hear my calling
[01:14.49](Forever and ever)
[01:21.26]Through distant lands
[01:24.53]Through mountain streams
[01:26.05]My river's running through your dreams
[01:30.67]There's an ocean in between
[01:34.16]Forever and never
[01:39.32]Chasing shadows through the years
[01:44.33]I whisper softly to my dear
[01:48.47]Be sure to know
[01:50.11]That I am hee forever
[01:54.30]So hear me now
[01:57.41]Calling out your name
[02:01.82]Burning on the flame
[02:06.47]Played the waiting game
[02:10.02]Hear my calling
[02:12.53]Hear my calling
[02:17.46]Whispers in the air
[02:20.87]Hear a lover's prayer
[02:24.11](I pray for you tonight)
[02:24.63]I can feel you there
[02:28.61]Hear my calling
[02:30.44]Hear my calling
[02:34.18]No man is an island
[02:38.04]That's an empty sin
[02:41.99]Discovery is a journey
[02:47.08]Just have to let me in
[02:53.96]Calling out your name
[02:59.92]Burning on the flame
[03:00.54](I'm reaching out to you)
[03:02.86]Played the waiting game
[03:06.64]Hear my calling
[03:09.00]Hear my calling
[03:12.02]Whispers in the air
[03:12.74](I dream you into life)
[03:16.54]Hear a lover's prayer
[03:18.93](I pray for you tonight)
[03:20.78]I can feel you there
[03:24.43]Hear my calling
[03:26.98]Hear my calling
[03:31.07]No man is an island
[03:32.96](A wish that could come true)
[03:34.99]That's an empty sin
[03:36.50](I'm reaching out to you)
[03:40.32]So steal the night and fly with me
[03:43.48]I'm calling
[03:46.37]Hear my calling
