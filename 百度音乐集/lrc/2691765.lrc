[00:28.29]Two jumps in a week,
[00:29.99]I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
[00:39.14]Flying on your motorcycle,
[00:42.02]Watching all the ground beneath you drop.
[00:46.22]
[00:49.90]You'd kill yourself for recognition,
[00:52.85]Kill yourself to never ever stop.
[01:00.90]You broke another mirror.
[01:03.65]You're turning into something you are not.
[01:08.76]
[01:10.28]Don't leave me high,
[01:15.72]Don't leave me dry.
[01:21.13]Don't leave me high,
[01:26.54]Don't leave me dry.
[01:29.95]
[01:45.04]Drying up in conversation,
[01:47.79]You'll be the one who cannot talk.
[01:56.10]All your insides fall to pieces,
[01:58.80]You just sit there wishing you could still make love.
[02:04.23]
[02:07.02]They're the ones who'll hate you,
[02:09.11]When you think you've got the world all sussed out.
[02:17.94]They're the ones who'll spit on you,
[02:20.55]You'll be the one screaming out.
[02:26.09]
[02:26.79]Don't leave me high,
[02:32.05]Don't leave me dry.
[02:37.46]Don't leave me high,
[02:42.78]Don't leave me dry...
[02:49.95]
[03:09.99]Oh it's the best thing that you ever had,
[03:14.16]Best thing that you ever, ever had.
[03:21.90]It's the best thing that you ever had,
[03:24.98]The best thing you have had has gone away...
[03:30.40]
[03:31.22]Don't leave me high,
[03:36.62]Don't leave me dry.
[03:41.95]Don't leave me high,
[03:47.30]Don't leave me dry.
[03:52.70]Don't leave me high...
[04:01.11]
[04:03.38]Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry.
