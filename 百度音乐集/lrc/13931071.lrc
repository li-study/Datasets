[00:02.32]
[00:15.85]All my friends are going out
[00:18.00]But I've been thinking
[00:21.42]Maybe I better stay in bed
[00:23.65]The ceiling's spinning 'round
[00:26.03]Like I've been drinking
[00:28.88]I've got this banging in my head
[00:31.06]Boom, boom, boom
[00:32.77]I need my medicine
[00:36.66]And the cure in aspirin
[00:38.76]
[00:38.78]I don't care about tomorrow
[00:42.58]Here we go again
[00:44.09]Here we go again
[00:45.88]I'll be the last one on the dance floor
[00:50.12]When this party ends
[00:51.63]When this party ends
[00:53.67]
[00:54.27]I don't even care, no
[00:55.80]I don't even care, no
[00:57.62]Never want to say
[00:59.41]I wish that I'd been there
[01:01.29]
[01:01.34]I don't even care, no
[01:03.20]I don't even care, no
[01:05.04]Never want to say
[01:07.39]I wish that I'd been there
[01:13.33]
[01:16.43]I'll sleep through the alarm
[01:19.06]Head under pillow
[01:21.91]I know I'm gonna pay for this
[01:24.21]I can't stand missing out
[01:26.58]So when you call me
[01:29.02]I'll say ok, if you insist
[01:31.72]Boom, boom, boom
[01:33.90]I need my medicine
[01:37.49]And the cure in aspirin
[01:39.01]
[01:39.46]I don't care about tomorrow
[01:42.85]Here we go again
[01:44.56]Here we go again
[01:46.45]I'll be the last one on the dance floor
[01:50.43]When this party ends

[02:15.03]Never want to say I wish that I was there
[02:22.57]Never want to say I wish that I was there
[02:30.13]Never want to say I wish that I was there
[02:32.21]
