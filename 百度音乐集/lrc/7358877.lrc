[00:25.84]Instead of asking you
[00:27.44]She asks everyone you're with and ends up
[00:30.81]In dark conclusion you're not alone
[00:36.11]She calls you up repeatedly
[00:39.12]Knows where you're at all the time
[00:43.92]At night you tell her that she's all you long for
[00:48.13]But she knows by your face there has got to be more
[00:52.33]Her eyes are too narrow, her leg are too long
[00:57.07]She knows by this time tomorrow you'll be gone
[01:04.03]You'll be gone.

[01:39.73]At night you tell her that she's all you long for
[01:43.90]But she knows by your face there has got to be more
[01:48.05]Her eyes are too narrow, her leg are too long
[01:52.66]She knows by this time tomorrow you'll be gone
[01:59.81]You'll be gone.
[02:17.28]Na na na na na na na na

[02:29.02]At night you tell her that she's all you long for
[02:33.10]But she knows by your face there has got to be more
[02:37.37]Her eyes are too narrow, her leg are too long
[02:42.01]She knows by this time tomorrow you'll be gone
[02:53.26]You'll be gone.
