[00:05]
[00:06]At first I was afraid I was petrified
[00:09]Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side;
[00:13]But then I spent so many nights
[00:15]Thinkin' how you did me wrong
[00:18]And I grew strong
[00:20]And I learn how to get along
[00:22]And so you're back from outer space
[00:26]I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
[00:30]I should have changed that stupid lock
[00:32]I should have made you leave your key
[00:34]If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
[04:01][02:39][02:00][00:38]Go on now, go walk out the door
[04:04][02:42][02:04][00:42]Just turn around now
[04:06][02:44][02:07][00:44]('cause) you're not welcome anymore
[04:10][02:47][02:09][00:47]Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
[04:13][02:50][02:13][00:51]Did I crumble
[04:15][02:52][02:15][00:52]Did you think I'd lay down and die?
[04:17][02:55][02:17][00:55]Oh no, not.I. I will survive
[04:21][02:58][02:21][00:59]Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive;
[04:26][03:03][02:25][01:03]I've got all my life to live,
[04:27][03:05][02:28][01:05]I've got all my love to give and I'll survive,
[04:34][04:31][03:11][03:09][02:31][01:09]I will survive.
[03:13][01:13]
[03:27][01:28]It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
[03:31][01:32]Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
[03:35][01:36]And I spent oh so many nights
[03:38][01:38]Just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry
[03:41][01:42]But now I hold my head up high
[03:44][01:44]And you see me somebody new
[03:48][01:48]I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
[03:52][01:53]And so you feel like droppin' in
[03:54][01:54]And just expect me to be free,
[03:56][01:56]Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
