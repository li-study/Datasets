[00:35.80]I was the third brother of five,
[00:40.33]Doing whatever I had to do to survive.
[00:44.87]I'm not saying what I did was alright,
[00:48.81]Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day
[00:53.21]Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind,
[00:57.40]I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find
[01:02.26]You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
[01:06.39]Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester.
[03:07.02][02:58.57][02:48.39][02:39.07][01:36.75][01:27.94][01:17.98][01:10.23]Across 110th Street,
[02:44.86][01:13.93]Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak
[02:54.21][01:22.76]Pushers won't let the junkie go free.
[01:32.37]Woman trying to catch a trick on the street.
[03:11.37][01:41.40]You can find it all in the street.
[02:01.41]I got one more thing I'd like to y'all about right now.
[02:06.49]Hey brother, there's a better way out.
[02:11.11]Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out
[02:15.75]Take my advice, it's either live or die.
[02:19.37]You've got to be strong, if you want to survive.
[02:24.01]The family on the other side of town,
[02:27.95]Would catch hell without a ghetto around.
[02:32.57]In every city you find the same thing going down,
[02:37.72]Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town.
[03:02.57]A woman trying to catch a trick on the street, ouh baby
[03:22.28]Yes he can, oh
[03:26.41]Look around you, just look around you,
[03:30.44]Look around you, look around you, uh yeah
