[00:42.64]Can you feel it,
[00:44.53]Can you feel it?

[01:55.65]Is someone's death in another place
[02:00.91]Every healthy smile
[02:03.30]Is hunger and strife to another child
[02:08.57]But the stars do shine
[02:11.04]In promising salvation, is near this time

[02:56.46]Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
[03:02.28]Yes we're all the same.
