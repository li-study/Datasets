[00:00.58]Jack Johnson - You And Your Heart
[00:01.98]
[00:31.51]Watch you when you say
[00:33.21]What you are and when you blame
[00:35.17]Everyone, You broken king
[00:40.43]Watch you change the frame or
[00:42.35]Watch you when you take your aim
[00:44.54]At the sum of everything
[00:48.10]
[00:48.90]Cause you and your heart
[00:52.80]shouldn't feel so far apart
[00:57.49]You can choose what you take
[01:02.06]Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard
[01:06.70]
[01:25.05]You lay there in the street
[01:27.24]Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
[01:31.21]But you're not the flame
[01:33.93]You got the people passing by
[01:35.89]Because you know what you don't like
[01:38.25]It's just so easy, it's just so easy
[01:42.37]
[01:42.84]But you and your heart
[01:46.77]Shouldn't feel so far apart
[01:51.28]You can choose what you take
[01:55.58]Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard
[02:00.42]Oh and you and your heart
[02:04.81]Shouldn't feel so far apart
[02:09.29]You can choose what you take
[02:13.33]Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard
[02:17.69]
[02:32.28]You draw so many lines in the sand
[02:34.64]Lost the fingernails on your hands
[02:36.75]How you're gonna scratch any backs?
[02:39.14]Better hope that time will take our lines away
[02:43.72]Take all our lines and
[02:46.45]Hope that time will take our lines and
[02:51.14]Hope that time will take our lines away
[02:57.74]Take all our lines away
[03:01.89]
