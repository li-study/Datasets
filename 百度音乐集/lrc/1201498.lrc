[00:01.26]Something Stupid
[00:11.12]I know I stand in line
[00:12.67]Until you think you have the time
[00:15.04]To spend an evening with me
[00:20.05]And if we go someplace to dance
[00:22.26]I know that there's a chance
[00:24.07]You won't be leaving with me
[00:29.11]Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
[00:32.96]And have a drink or two
[00:37.99]And then I go and spoil it all
[00:40.45]By saying something stupid Like I love you
[00:47.12]I can see it in your eyes
[00:48.84]You still despise the same old lines
[00:51.25]You heard the night before
[00:56.00]And though it's just a line to you
[00:58.50]For me it's true And never seemed so right before
[01:04.97]I practice every day to find some cleverlines
[01:08.65]to say To make the meaning come true
[01:14.02]But then I think I'll wait
[01:16.45]until the eveninggets lateAnd I'm alone with you
[01:23.08]The time is rightYour perfume fills my head
[01:26.28]The stars get red And oh the night's so blue
[01:32.03]And then I go and spoil it all
[01:34.67]By saying something stupid Like I love you
[01:59.07]The time is right Your perfume fills my head
[02:02.32]The stars get redAnd oh the night's so blue
[02:08.03]And then I go and spoil it all
[02:10.86]By saying something stupidLike I love you
[02:17.39]I love you
[02:21.86]I love you
[02:25.76]I love you
[02:30.26]I love you
[02:34.81]I love you
[02:39.24]I love you
