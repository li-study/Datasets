[00:26.64]Somehow I know that
[00:28.82]There's a place up above
[00:31.19]With no more hurt and struggling
[00:34.62]Free of all atrocities and suffering
[00:38.73]Because I feel the unconditional love
[00:43.30]From one who cares enough for me
[00:46.66]To erase all my burdens
[00:48.40]And let me be free to
[00:49.89]Fly like a bird  Take to the sky
[00:53.16]I need you now Lord  Carry me high
[00:56.17]Don't let the world break me tonight
[00:59.07]I need the strength of you by my side
[01:02.13]Sometimes this life can be so cold
[01:05.11]I pray you'll come and carry me home
[01:14.38]Can we recover
[01:16.42]Will the world ever be
[01:18.85]A place of peace and harmony
[01:22.37]With no war and with no brutality
[01:26.11]If we loved each other
[01:28.28]We would find victory
[01:30.74]But in this harsh reality
[01:34.20]Sometimes I'm so despondant
[01:36.06]That I feel the need to
[01:38.16]Fly like a bird
[01:39.52]Take to the sky
[01:41.23]I need You now Lord  Carry me high
[01:44.23]Don't let the world break me tonight
[01:47.18]I need the strength of You by my side
[01:50.13]Sometimes this life can be so cold
[01:53.13]I pray You'll come and carry me home
[02:21.96]Keep your head to the sky
[02:26.34]With God's love you'll survive
[03:01.63][02:37.06]Fly like a bird  Take to the sky
[03:04.40][02:39.64]I need you now Lord  Carry me high
[03:07.38][02:42.86]Don't let the world break me tonight
[03:10.20][02:45.80]I need the strength of You by my side
[03:13.28][02:48.86]Sometimes this life can be so cold
[03:16.22][02:51.80]I pray You'll come and carry me home
[03:19.90]Carry me higher  higher  higher
[03:27.48]Carry me higher  higher  higher
[03:30.28]Carry me home  Higher Jesus
[03:36.67]Carry me higher Lord
