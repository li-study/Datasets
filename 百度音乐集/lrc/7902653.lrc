[00:29.34]My love don\'t cost a thing
[00:32.43]When you rolled up in the Escalade
[00:34.82]Saw that truck you gave to the valet
[00:37.36]Knew that it was game when you looked at me
[00:39.82]Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling
[00:42.27]Saw you later in the corner booth
[00:44.71]Raising up a toast so I would notice you
[00:47.10]But your heart\'s a mess
[00:48.28]Think you outta know
[00:49.54]Doesn\'t matter if you\'re balling out of control

[01:22.80]Thought you\'d understand
[01:23.94]Baby, credit cards aren\'t romance
[01:26.44]So you\'re tryin\' to buy what\'s already yours
[01:28.97]What I need from you is not available in stores
[01:31.40]Seen a side of you that I really feel
[01:33.88]Doing way too much, never keep it real
[01:36.28]If it doesn\'t change, gotta hit the road
[01:38.76]Now I\'m leaving, where\'s my keys?
