[00:41.23]you must remember this
[00:45.02]a kiss is still a kiss
[00:48.96]a sigh is just a sigh
[00:55.56]the fundamental things apply
[01:03.82]as time goes by
[01:14.05]and when two lovers woo
[01:17.76]they still say,"i love you."
[01:21.82]on this you can rely
[01:27.92]no matter what the future brings
[01:37.28]as time goes by
[01:47.56]*moonlight and love songs
[01:51.64]never out of date
[01:55.48]hearts full of passion
[01:59.48]jealousy and hate
[02:03.35]woman needs man
[02:07.40]and man must have his mate on this you can deny
[02:36.99]the fundamental things apply
[02:43.32]as time goes by
