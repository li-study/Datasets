[00:18.82]It seems like every story told about us isn't meant to be
[00:28.42]We fly on wings of gold all the way back home to me
[00:36.91]But what I'm thinking of just this time
[00:45.15]Why don't you lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
[00:57.16]Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
[01:06.80]
[01:10.88]You know my love this is no dream of mine
[01:19.81]But the way you ride those waves makes me want to follow you blind
[01:27.86]And what I'm thinking of just this time
[01:36.85]Why don't you lay your head down in my arms, in my arms.
[01:49.02]Lay your head down in my arms.
[01:58.31]Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
[02:07.89]Lay your head down, in my arms.
[02:19.46]
[03:16.50]Lay your head down in my arms, in my arms
[03:26.60]Lay your head down
[03:36.28]Lay your head down
[03:41.85]in my arms
