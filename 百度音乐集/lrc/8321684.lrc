[00:20.80]
[00:22.83]I just remembered, that time at the market
[00:27.32]Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
[00:33.15]And rode down, isle 5
[00:41.16]You looked behind you to smile back at me
[00:46.50]Crashed into a rack full of magazines
[00:51.39]They asked us if we could leave.
[01:01.08]
[01:08.36]Can't remember, what went wrong last September
[01:16.27]Thiugh i'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to
[01:23.38]
[01:26.82]Our love was, comfortable and
[01:35.46]So broken in
[01:40.63]
[01:42.78]I sleep with this new girl i'm still getting used to
[01:47.30]My friends all approve, say she's gonna be good for you
[01:52.92]They throw me, high fives
[02:00.27]She says the bible is all that she reads
[02:05.66]And prefers that I not use profanity
[02:10.52]Your mouth was, so dirty
[02:18.22]Life of the party
[02:21.78]And she swears that she's artsy
[02:26.76]But you could distinguish
[02:30.51]Miles from Coltrane
[02:33.76]
[02:36.88]Our love was, comfortable and
[02:45.53]So broken in
[02:53.98]She's perfect, so flawless
[03:02.67]Or so they say, say
[03:22.20]
[03:29.63]She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin'
[03:33.82]And poses for pictures that are being taken
[03:39.47]I loved you
[03:43.72]Grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect
[03:56.36]Our love was, comfortable and
[04:04.83]So broken in
[04:13.14]She's perfect, so flawless
[04:21.66]I'm not impressed, I want you back.
