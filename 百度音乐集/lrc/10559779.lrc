[00:02.00]The Dresden Dolls - Pretty In Pink
[00:07.00]
[00:20.54]Caroline laughs and it's raining all day
[00:24.02]And she loves to be one of the girls
[00:27.45]She lives in the place in the side of our lives
[00:30.74]Where nothing is ever put straight
[00:34.25]She turns her self sound and she smiles and she says
[00:37.65]"This is it, that's the end of the joke!"
[00:41.07]And she loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
[00:44.42]And her lovers walk through with their coats
[00:47.44]She's pretty in pink
[02:44.50][01:34.70][01:13.47][00:53.31]Isn't she pretty in pink?
[02:51.14][01:41.56][01:00.19]Isn't she?
[01:02.16]All of her lovers all talk of her notes
[01:04.98]And the flowers that they never sent
[01:08.61]And wasn't she easy?
[01:17.35]The one who insists he was first in her line is the last to remember her name
[01:24.20]And he's walking around in this dress that she wore
[01:27.65]She is gone but the joke's the same...
[02:40.73][01:31.10]Pretty in pink
[02:10.42]Caroline talks to you softly sometimes
[02:14.33]She says "I love you" and too much
[02:17.93]She doesn't have anything you'd wanna steal
[02:22.01]Well... Nothing you can touch
[02:26.03]She waves, she buttons your shirt
[02:32.50]The traffic is waiting outside
[02:34.55]She hands you this coat
[02:36.45]She hands you her clothes
[02:38.36]These cars collide
