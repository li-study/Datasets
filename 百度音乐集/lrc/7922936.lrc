[00:06.21]Do you remember when you walked with me
[00:11.47]Down the street into the square?
[00:16.52]How the women selling rosemary
[00:21.97]Pressed the branches to your chest,
[00:24.78]Promised luck and all the rest,
[00:27.38]And put their fingers in your hair?
[00:37.90]I had met you just the day before,
[00:42.92]Like an accident of fate,
[00:48.21]In the window there behind your door.
[00:53.68]How i wanted to break in
[00:56.46]To that room beneath your skin,
[00:59.09]But all that would have to wait.
[01:03.22]In the carmen of the martyrs,
[01:05.82]With the statues in the courtyard
[01:08.45]Whose heads and hands were taken,
[01:10.87]In the burden of the sun;
[01:13.77]I had come to meet you
[01:16.10]With a question in my footsteps.
[01:18.70]I was going up the hillside
[01:21.19]And the journey just begun.
[01:29.94]My sister says she never dreams at night
[01:35.24]There are days when i know why;
[01:40.26]Those possibilities within her sight,
[01:46.58]With no way of coming true.
[01:49.30]Some things just donï¼‡t get through
[01:51.37]Into this world , although they try.
[01:55.73]In the carmen of the martyrs,
[01:58.66]With the statues in the courtyard
[02:01.23]Whose heads and hands were taken,
[02:03.56]In the burden of the sun;
[02:06.58]I had come to meet you
[02:09.04]With a question in my footsteps.
[02:12.02]I was going up the hillside
[02:14.15]And the journey just begun.
[02:17.03]All i know of you
[02:24.30]Is in my memory
[02:27.32]All i ask is you
[02:35.03]Remember me.
