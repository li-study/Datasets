[00:02.00]Ellie Goulding - I'll Hold My Breath
[00:06.00]
[00:16.51]Breathe air you're not used to,
[00:22.10]tread floors you don't fall through
[00:25.71]Make waves...
[00:27.59]You crash a symbol hard
[00:29.52]Follow no one, always play the wrong card
[00:33.48]Waste days, in foreign places
[00:37.12]Shed lights, on your better side
[00:41.21]Reassure me that you'll wait for me,
[00:45.35]wait for me as long as it takes!
[00:48.34]And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath
[02:52.52][01:59.74][00:56.91]Until you see me in your dreams
[02:57.50][01:00.97]We'll stay awake beneath the trees
[03:01.77][02:07.13][01:04.89]We'll watch the buildings turn to dust
[03:05.75][02:11.08][01:08.74]A sky of diamonds just for us
[03:09.56][02:14.71][01:12.67]You are the risk I'll always take
[03:13.52][02:18.86][01:16.83]The only branch I'll never break
[02:22.65][01:20.50]Thsoe fears we'll blow them all way
[01:27.99]Fight fires in your best clothes,
[01:31.81]touch skin with your eyes closed
[01:35.91]Chase thunder...
[01:38.26]With the volume down
[01:40.01]Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town
[01:43.21]Force quit, on your losing streak
[01:47.54]Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek
[01:51.73]Tell me that we're still too young,
[01:55.73]that we're still too young and I'll my tongue
[02:03.22]WE'll stay awake beneath the trees
[02:30.18]I'm here, I'm here to save you
[02:37.50]No fall, I will swim to save you
[03:17.30]Those fears we'll blow them all way
