[00:02.00]Steven Curtis Chapman - Yours
[00:09.00]
[00:24.04]I walk the streets of London
[00:28.96]And notice in the faces passing by
[00:32.77]Somthing that makes me stop and listen
[00:37.22]My heart grows heavy with the cry
[00:41.51]Where is the hope for London?
[00:46.00]You whisper and my heart begins to soar
[00:50.28]As I'm reminded
[00:52.54]That every street in London is Yours
[00:58.74]Oh, yes it is
[01:02.41]I walk the dirt roads of Uganda
[01:07.12]I see the scars that war has left behind
[01:11.14]Hope like the sun is fading
[01:15.40]They're waiting for a cure no one can find
[01:19.64]And I hear children's voices singing
[01:23.91]Of a God who heals and rescues and restores
[01:28.70]And I'm reminded
[01:30.75]That every child in Africa is Yours
[04:21.80][04:04.88][03:09.70][02:52.56][01:53.60][01:36.27]And its all Yours, God, Yours, God
[06:07.34][04:38.80][04:27.19][04:10.11][03:14.96][02:57.91][01:58.55][01:41.99]Everything is Yours
[04:13.72][03:01.56][01:45.72]From the stars in the sky
[04:16.74][03:04.58][01:48.28]To the depths of the ocean floor
[03:18.59][02:02.51]You're the Maker and Keeper,
[03:21.55][02:05.18]Father and Ruler of everything
[02:10.08]It's all Yours
[02:18.81]And I walk the sidewalks of Nashville
[02:23.86]Like Singapore, Manila and Shanghai
[02:27.96]I rush by the beggar's hand and the wealthy man
[02:32.41]And everywhere I look I realize
[02:36.04]That just like the streets of London
[02:40.52]For every man and woman, boy and girl
[02:44.77]All of creation
[02:47.89]This is our Father's world
[05:11.39][03:39.78][03:35.25][03:31.60][03:27.01]It's all Yours, God
[03:56.43][03:44.09]The glory is Yours, God
[03:48.12]All the honor is Yours, God
[03:52.20]The power is Yours, God
[04:00.81]You're the King of Kings
[04:02.90]And Lord of Lords
[04:31.30]All the greatness and power,
[04:33.75]the glory and splendor and majesty
[04:45.85]Yeah, it's all Yours
[05:15.01]My life is Yours, my heart is Yours
[05:23.35]My hands and my feet
[05:26.77]Every song that I sing
[05:33.66]It's all Yours, all is Yours
[05:40.56]All belongs to You
[05:48.70]Our gifts are Yours, God
[05:53.54]All our dreams are Yours, God
[05:57.14]All our plans are Yours, God
[06:00.87]The whole earth is Yours, God
