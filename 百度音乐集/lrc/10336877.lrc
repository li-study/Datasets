[00:20.34]Out of the ruins
[00:25.37]out from the wreckage
[00:29.33]Can't make the same mistakes this time.
[00:38.50]We are the children
[00:43.91]the last generation
[00:47.72]
[00:49.02]We are the ones they lefl behind.
[00:56.59]And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
[01:06.20]Living under the fear till nothing else remains.

[01:56.98]their day is coming
[02:02.27]All else are castles built in the air
[02:08.27]
[02:10.11]And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
[02:19.41]Living under the fear till nothing else remains.

[02:45.00]So what do we do with our lives?
[02:51.13]We leave only a mark.
[02:55.00]Will our story shine like a light or end in the dark?
