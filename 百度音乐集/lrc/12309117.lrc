[00:00.77]Backstreet Boys - more than that
[00:03.54]
[00:05.64]I can see that you've been crying
[00:11.63]You can't hide it with a lie
[00:17.64]What's the use in you denying
[00:22.60]That what you have is wrong
[00:27.25]
[00:29.44]I heard him promise you forever
[00:35.56]But forever has come and gone
[00:41.55]Baby, he would say whatever
[00:46.40]It takes to keep you blind
[00:52.28]To the truth between the lines
[00:58.05]Oh I will love you more than that
[01:03.87]I won't say the words, then take them back
[01:10.58]Don't give loneliness a chance
[01:16.26]Baby listen to me when I say
[01:20.40]I will love you more than that
[01:26.34]Baby, you deserve much better
[01:32.21]What's the use in holding on
[01:38.19]Don't you see it's now or never
[01:43.17]'Cause I just can't be friends
[01:49.01]Baby knowing in the end
[01:54.70]That I will love you more than that
[02:00.61]I won't say the words, then take them back
[02:07.35]Don't give loneliness a chance
[02:12.96]Baby listen to me when I say
[02:16.48]
[02:19.30]There's not a day that passes by
[02:22.10]I don't wonder why we haven't tried
[02:25.32]It's not too late to change your mind
[02:28.19]And take my hand, don't say goodbye
[02:34.26]I will love you more than that
[02:39.47]I won't say the words, then take them back
[02:45.50]Oh I will love you more than that
[02:51.45]I won't say the words, then take them back
[02:58.15]Don't give loneliness a chance
[03:03.66]Baby listen to me when I say
[03:08.18]I will love you more than that
[03:10.09]Oh I will love you more than that
[03:15.85]I won't say the words, then take them back
[03:22.51]Don't give loneliness a chance
[03:28.06]Baby listen to me when I say
[03:31.61]I will love you more than that
