[00:14.02]It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
[00:21.25]When I try to explain how I feel
[00:27.17]that I still need your love after all that I've done
[00:34.38]
[00:35.09]You won't believe me
[00:40.17]All you will see is a girl you once knew
[00:45.42]Although she's dressed up to the nines
[00:50.62]At sixes and sevens with you
[00:58.51]
[01:00.10]I had to let it happen, I had to change
[01:07.83]Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
[01:13.34]Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
[01:20.24]
[01:21.32]So I chose freedom
[01:25.89]Running around, trying everything new
[01:31.55]But nothing impressed me at all
[01:37.83]I never expected it to
[01:47.22]
[01:49.40]Don't cry for me Argentina
[01:55.37]The truth is I never left you
[02:01.21]All through my wild days
[02:04.49]My mad existence
[02:07.48]I kept my promise
[02:10.49]Don't keep your distance
[02:14.70]
[02:19.02]And as for fortune, and as for fame
[02:25.73]I never invited them in
[02:31.64]Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
[02:39.61]
[02:40.60]They are illusions
[02:45.00]They are not the solutions they promised to be
[02:51.05]The answer was here all the time
[02:57.35]I love you and hope you love me
[03:08.03]Don't cry for me Argentina
[03:13.94]
[03:34.00]Don't cry for me Argentina
[03:39.81]The truth is I never left you
[03:46.61]All through my wild days
[03:52.76]My mad existence
[03:55.71]I kept my promise
[03:59.03]I keep your distance
[04:03.71]
[04:06.00]Have I said too much?
[04:08.18]There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
[04:15.20]
[04:16.90]But all you have to do is look at me to know
[04:21.28]That every word is true
[04:34.04]
[04:58.51]Don't cry for me Argentina
