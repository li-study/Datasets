[00:01.04]Carry on my wayward son,
[00:04.23]There'll be peace when you are done
[00:07.99]Lay your weary head to rest
[00:11.82]Now don't you cry no more
[00:14.21]
[00:45.83]Once I rose above the noise and confusion
[00:49.43]Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
[00:53.12]I was soaring ever higher,
[00:56.50]but I flew too high
[01:00.46]Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
[01:04.36]Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
[01:08.77]I hear the voices when I'm dreamin',
[01:11.80]I can hear them say
[01:15.33]
[01:15.62]Carry on my wayward son,
[01:19.47]There'll be peace when you are done
[01:23.27]Lay your weary head to rest
[01:27.01]Now don't you cry no more
[01:29.68]
[01:40.29]Masquerading as a man with a reason
[01:43.99]My charade is the event of the season
[01:47.64]And if I claim to be a wise man,
[01:51.44]it surely means that I don't know
[01:55.23]On a stormy sea of moving emotion
[01:59.02]Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
[02:02.83]I set a course for winds of fortune,
[02:06.52]but I hear the voices say
[02:09.83]
[02:10.31]Carry on my wayward son,
[02:14.08]There'll be peace when you are done
[02:17.82]Lay your weary head to rest
[02:21.70]Now don't you cry no more
[02:26.70]
[03:24.51]Carry on, you will always remember
[03:27.98]Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
[03:31.78]Now your life's no longer empty
[03:35.72]Surely heaven waits for you
[03:38.69]
[03:38.87]Carry on my wayward son,
[03:42.55]There'll be peace when you are done
[03:46.72]Lay your weary head to rest
[03:50.59]Now don't you cry no more
[03:56.07]
