[03:27.56][01:22.62][00:20.60]
[00:30.07]I don't need a lot of things
[00:33.23]I can get by with nothing
[00:37.09]Of all the blessings life can bring
[00:39.58]I've always needed something
[00:43.60]But I've got all I want
[00:46.33]When it comes to loving you
[00:49.76]You're my only reason
[00:52.91]You're my only truth
[02:27.94][01:55.34][00:55.40]I need you like water
[02:32.32][01:58.97][00:59.15]Like breath, like rain
[02:34.84][02:01.74][01:01.90]I need you like mercy
[02:38.80][02:05.61][01:05.52]From heaven's gate
[02:42.29][02:09.01][01:08.97]There's a freedom in your arms
[02:45.39][02:12.48][01:12.59]That carries me through
[03:21.33][03:01.34][02:48.24][02:15.20][01:15.35]I need you
[01:29.70]You're the hope that moves me
[01:32.31]To courage again
[01:36.30]You're the love that rescues me
[01:38.87]When the cold winds, rage
[01:42.79]And it's so amazing
[01:45.40]'Cause that's just how you are
[01:49.62]And I can't turn back now
[01:52.05]'Cause you've brought me too far
[02:54.68][02:20.80]Oh yes I do
