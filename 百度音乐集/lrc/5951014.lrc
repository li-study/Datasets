[00:12.00]
[00:16.28]Even when the thunder and storm begins
[00:19.66]I'll be standing stong like a tree in the wind
[00:23.27]Nothing is gonna move this mountain or change my direction
[00:29.95]I'm falling off the sky and I'm all alone
[00:33.74]The courage that's inside is gonna break my fall
[00:37.14]Nothing is gonna dim my light within
[00:43.32]But if I keep going on it will never be impossible
[00:52.15]Not today.
[00:55.14]
[00:56.07]Cause I got something to believe in
[00:59.98]As long as I'm breathing
[01:03.48]There is not a limit to what I can dream
[01:10.56]Cause I got something to believe in
[01:14.25]Mission to keep climbing
[01:17.92]Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
[01:24.76]And I believe in me.
[01:27.50]
[01:27.90]Even when the world tries to pull me down
[01:31.67]Tell me that I can't... try to turn me around
[01:34.93]I wont let them put my fire out
[01:40.96]But if I keep going on it will never be impossible
[01:49.06]Not today
[01:52.53]
[01:53.64]Cause I got something to believe in
[01:57.38]As long as I'm breathing
[02:00.95]There is not a limit to what I can dream
[02:08.06]Cause I got something to believe in
[02:11.82]Mission to keep climbing
[02:15.43]Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
[02:22.24]And I believe
[02:23.90]
[02:24.20]I can do it all, open every door
[02:38.76]Turn unthinkable to reality
[02:45.23]You see I can do it all and more
[02:51.90]
[02:52.88]Believing as long as I'm breathing
[02:58.41]There is no limit to what I can dream
[03:07.03]Believing mission to keep climbing
[03:12.69]Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
[03:19.34]And I believe in me.
