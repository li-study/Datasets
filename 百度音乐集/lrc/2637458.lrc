[00:00.00]Case - Crazy
[00:01.00]
[00:03.54]I just feel sad when I think of love
[00:07.34]And this is the saddest day I'm going through, hmmm
[00:17.48]Even though I know, that it's all because of me
[00:24.07]I can't believe that you would go away and leave me so lonely
[00:32.08]I'm trying to hold my head and live beside of all this pain
[00:40.02]I need to feel your touch, your tender kiss
[00:44.14]So that I can breathe again
[00:49.59]You gotta forgive me if you feel I'm going wrong
[00:56.19]But it feels like I'm just going down
[01:00.15]And I'm feeling this way too long
[01:03.15]
[01:05.91]Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
[01:12.90]Out of my mind over you
[01:17.28](It's all because of you I don't know what I'm gonna do)
[01:21.85]I know that I don't need another lady
[01:28.83]Cause deep inside my heart I love you
[01:36.64]
[01:37.83]Tonight I know for sure what I lost in you
[01:44.35]A happy home that's always safe and warm
[01:48.94]And maybe a baby or two
[01:53.51]Sometimes at night I cry and I can't get no sleep
[02:00.54]I pray to Lord my soul to take away
[02:05.06]If your love I can't keep
[02:10.06]You gotta forgive me if you feel I'm going wrong
[02:16.95]But it feels like I'm just going down
[02:20.64]And I'm feeling this way too long
[02:23.39]
[02:26.38]Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
[02:32.30]Out of my mind over you
[02:38.59](I don't know what I'm gonna do)
[02:42.33]I know that I don't need another lady
[02:48.87]Cause deep inside my heart I love you
[02:58.55]Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
[03:05.49]Out of my mind over you
[03:10.72](I don't know what I'm gonna do)
[03:13.99]I know that I don't need another lady
[03:21.35]Cause deep inside my heart I love you
[03:26.50]
[03:27.24]You see sometimes I get a little lonely baby late at night baby
[03:32.00]I wanna call you baby
[03:33.76]Sometimes I feel I'm going down (down)
[03:38.43]
[03:46.97]Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
[03:53.86]Out of my mind over you
[03:59.42](Who will love me all through the day)
[04:02.78]I know that I don't need another lady
[04:09.64]Cause deep inside my heart I love you
[04:13.74]
[04:15.95]Everybody help me sing
[04:18.03]Every now and then
[04:21.90]I may not know just when
[04:24.89]I'll find a love that will treat me right
[04:30.70]Somebody's gonna wreck this lil' heart of mine
[04:33.80]And take it from me baby...
