[00:21.44]Some of us, We're hardly ever here
[00:26.22]The rest of us, we're born to disappear
[00:31.02]How do I stop myself from
[00:31.94]Being just a number
[00:34.91]How do I hold my head
[00:37.00]To keep from going under
[00:38.81]
[00:39.28]Down to the wire
[00:42.20]I wanted water but
[00:43.91]But I'll walk through the fire
[00:47.08]If this is what it takes
[00:48.84]To take me even higher
[00:52.17]Then I'll come through
[00:53.43]Like I do
[00:54.70]When the world keeps
[00:56.53]Testing me, testing me, testing me
[01:00.25]
[01:09.28]How did they find me here
[01:11.73]What do they want from me
[01:14.16]All of these vultures hanging
[01:16.30]Right outside my door
[01:19.04]I hear them whispering
[01:21.52]They're tryin to ride it out
[01:24.02]They've never gone this long
[01:25.91]Without a kill before
[01:27.64]
[01:28.72]Down to the wire
[01:31.24]I wanted water but
[01:33.26]I'll walk through the fire
[01:35.95]If this is what it takes
[01:37.81]To take me even higher
[01:41.72]Then I'll come through
[01:42.67]Like I do
[01:43.84]When the world keeps
[01:45.72]Testing me, testing me, testing me
[01:49.28]

[02:27.79]Wheels up
[02:29.48]I got to leave this evening
[02:32.47]Can't seem to keep these vultures
[02:34.71]Off of my trail
[02:37.69]Powers is made, by power being taken
[02:42.40]I keep on running
[02:44.74]To protect my situation
[02:46.85]
[02:47.06]Down to the wire
[02:49.92]I wanted water but
[02:51.83]I'll walk through the fire
[02:54.46]If this is what it takes
[02:56.55]To take me even higher
[02:59.58]Then I'll come through
[03:01.18]Like I do
[03:02.41]When the world keeps
[03:03.98]Testing me, testing me, testing
[03:08.62]
[03:27.02]Whatcha gonna do about it
[03:29.20]Whatcha gonna do about it
