[00:06.97]You told me it's the truth
[00:07.93]But I'm still afraid
[00:09.81]I'm not the one
[00:10.66]That would jump the gun
[00:12.54]If I had proof
[00:13.50]I'd take off my shades
[00:15.55]And be blinded by the sun
[00:16.84]
[00:17.35]One lie, two lies
[00:18.53]I shoulda said shoe flies
[00:19.95]Shame on me
[00:20.93]I usually see through lies
[00:22.70]Said you loved me, yeah right
[00:24.36]I thought we were air tight
[00:26.45]You were playing foul
[00:27.82]It was far from a fair fight
[00:29.14]I hung onto your every word
[00:30.60]Sweetest shit I ever heard
[00:31.98]I even made you pinky swear
[00:33.37]Just so I was reassured
[00:34.84]The rumors started gettin back
[00:36.18]That so and so was hittin' that
[00:37.63]Silly me for being such
[00:39.04]A 'natic for that kitty cat

[00:49.89]And be blinded by the sun
[00:51.47]You said you were in love
[00:53.45]But the games you played
[00:54.96]I hope that you're having fun
[00:57.33]You see I need you
[00:58.40]To take off my shades
[01:00.36]And be blinded by the sun
[01:02.55]
[01:03.66]Three lies, four lies
[01:04.69]You shoulda been a tour guide
[01:06.12]The way you lead me on
[01:07.41]Knowing I was one of four guys
[01:08.90]Said you loved me, okay
[01:10.34]Where were you the other day?
[01:11.77]Your car was parked at 38th
[01:13.20]But you were
[01:14.17]At your mothers place?
[01:14.94]Your mother lives on Broadway
[01:16.00]I followed you all day
[01:17.45]
[01:17.79]I called but you ignored it
[01:18.66]When you kissed him
[01:19.65]In the hallway
[01:20.45]Call me crazy, call me odd
[01:21.64]Call me what you want to
[01:22.81]But Karma is a bitch
[01:24.16]I pray to God
[01:25.03]She always haunts you
[01:26.07]
[01:26.54]You told me it's the truth
