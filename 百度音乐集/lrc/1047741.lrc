[00:20.50]
[00:30.50]Sung By "Springsteen, Bruce"
[00:40.50]
[00:41.50]I was bruised and battered and I couldn't tell
[00:44.50]What I felt
[00:47.50]I was unrecognizable to myself
[00:50.50]I saw my reflection in a window I didn't know
[00:54.50]My own face
[00:56.50]Oh brother are you gonna leave me
[00:59.50]Wastin&acute;away
[01:01.50]On the streets of philadelphia
[01:22.50]I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
[01:27.50]I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
[01:32.50]At night I could hear the blood in my veins
[01:37.50]Black and whispering as the rain
[01:41.50]On the streets of philadelphia
[02:04.50]Ain't no angel gonna greet me
[02:09.50]It's just you and I my friend
[02:14.50]My clothes don't fit me no more
[02:18.50]I walked a thousand miles
[02:22.50]Just to slip the skin
[02:27.50]The night has fallen, I'm lyin'awake
[02:31.50]I can feel myself fading away
[02:36.50]So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
[02:42.50]Or will we leave each other alone like this
[02:46.50]On the streets of philadelphia
[03:33.50]
