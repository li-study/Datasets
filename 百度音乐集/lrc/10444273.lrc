[00:01.12]Ballas Hough Band - Underwater
[00:07.10]
[00:26.72]When your sky is falling down
[00:29.75]And your green is turning brown
[00:32.88]And you can't go any longer
[00:38.96]When your friends are all away
[00:42.07]And you lose track of the days
[00:45.12]And you're not getting any stronger
[00:49.39]
[00:49.68]I remember when you held me underwater
[00:55.91]I can't help it, but it's something I don't wanna be a part of
[01:01.35]
[01:02.11]But my eyes cry gently, and I can't hide
[01:07.92]You make feel so lost
[01:09.90]So lost inside
[01:14.72]And you don't get it, how hard I've tried
[01:20.05]You make me feel so lost,
[01:22.18]so lost inside
[01:37.62]
[01:38.36]Well, that's how I'm feeling
[01:40.50]Every midnight, every morning
[01:44.00]And lately it's been starting to really get old
[01:50.95]Oh, I miss you but believe me I won't be calling
[01:56.20]After your last performance
[01:59.10]It's really getting old
[02:01.96]
[02:03.16]I remember how you held me underwater
[02:09.69]Feeling helpless, and it's something I don't wanna be a part of
[02:15.21]
[02:15.98]But my eyes cry gently and I can't hide
[02:21.66]You make me feel so lost
[02:23.75]So lost inside
[02:28.70]And you don't get it, how hard I've tried
[02:33.97]You make me feel so lost
[02:36.23]So lost inside
[02:40.64]
[02:41.14]Why do I always feel alone
[02:45.48]When you're standing here by my side?
[02:47.88]Why does it never feel like home?
[02:52.12]Well, when I look in your eyes,
[02:53.95]It's no surprise that this heart is never healing
[02:58.61]I know I'll be fine
[03:01.38]Said I know I'll be fine
[03:15.65]
[03:17.09]I remember how you held me underwater
[03:23.63]Feeling helpless, and it's something I don't wanna be a part of
[03:28.87]
[03:29.68]But these eyes cry gently and I can't hide
[03:35.27]You make me feel so lost
[03:37.53]So lost inside
[03:41.32]
[03:42.46]And you don't get it, how hard I've tried
[03:47.57]You make me feel so lost
[03:49.85]So lost inside
[03:57.08]
