[00:18.95]Love goes out, out like a light
[00:23.84]Out like a flame
[00:26.15]and you can't find it anymore
[00:31.12]Just when you think it's lost in the rain
[00:35.81]It comes back knocking at your door
[00:43.60]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[00:53.57]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[01:03.16]And around
[01:07.05]God put us here on this carnival ride
[01:12.34]We close our eyes
[01:14.53]Never knowing where it will take us next
[01:19.92]Babies are born and at the same time
[01:24.41]someone's taking their last breath
[01:32.49]It's the wheel of the world
[01:42.07]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[01:51.84]In the blink of an eye
[01:54.54]It can change your life
[01:56.83]And it never even slows down
[02:01.62]It's the wheel of the world
[02:12.80]I don't know what it is
[02:14.89]I'm flying high
[02:15.99]Then I'm wondering
[02:17.99]why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
[02:23.27]Life keeps on moving anyway
[02:33.45]It's the wheel of the world
[02:43.23]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[02:52.78]It's the wheel of the world
[03:02.66]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[03:12.34]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[03:22.11]And around
[03:27.20]And around
[03:31.99]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[03:42.07]It can open your heart
[03:43.97]It can break you apart
[03:46.36]And it never even slows down
[03:51.35]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[04:01.03]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[04:10.80]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[04:20.68]It's the wheel of the world turning around
[04:30.57]And around
