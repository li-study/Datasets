[00:19.66]Take a look at my eyes
[00:22.40]It's been a long, long time
[00:27.16]I used to feel so strong
[00:31.09]When I knew you were mine
[00:35.84]But since you let me down
[00:38.76]I'm hard to be around
[00:40.48]I don't know what I'm gonna do
[00:43.26]He could never be you
[00:47.45]He could never be you
[00:53.72]I guess it all comes around
[00:56.86]Baby, please don't cry
[01:01.48]Love is gonna be a little reckless
[01:05.50]Oh, lovers all have to stand trial
[01:10.66]Since you let me go
[01:13.03]There's nothing going on
[01:14.71]I don't know what I'm gonna do
[01:17.30]He could never be you
[01:21.41]He could never be you
[01:25.73]He could never be you
[01:36.01]He knows the rules
[01:40.14]And he plays the part
[01:44.04]But he only has me
[01:48.80]He don't have my heart
[02:04.62]He could never be you
[02:10.67]So take a look at my eyes
[02:13.81]No you can't hide the truth
[02:18.12]No you don't get by on pride
[02:22.43]It'll run over you
[02:27.56]Since you let me down
[02:29.99]I'm hard to be around
[02:31.66]I don't know what I'm gonna do
[02:34.28]He could never be you
[02:38.42]He could never be you
[02:47.14]He could never be you
[02:59.80]He could never be you
