[00:02.24]Various Artists
[00:04.10]
[00:23.09]Left broken empty in despair
[00:25.87]Wanna breath can't find air
[00:27.32]Thought you were sent from up above
[00:29.62]But you and me never had love
[00:31.41]So much more I have to say
[00:33.51]Help me find a way
[00:35.22]
[00:37.37]And I wonder if you know
[00:39.12]How it really feels
[00:41.10]To be left outside alone
[00:43.08]When it's cold out here
[00:44.98]Well maybe you should know
[00:46.81]Just how it feels
[00:48.68]To be left outside alone
[00:50.70]To be left outside alone
[00:53.08]I tell ya..
[00:53.76]All my life I've been waiting
[00:56.54]For you to bring a fairytale my way
[01:00.27]Been living in a fantasy without meaning
[01:04.25]It's not okay I don't feel safe
[01:08.44]I need to pray
[01:10.74]
[01:12.34]Why do you play me like a game?
[01:15.25]Always someone else to blame
[01:17.08]Careless, helpless little man
[01:18.91]Someday you might understand
[01:21.16]There's not much more to say
[01:23.06]But I hope you find a way
[01:24.93]

[01:45.89]For you to bring a fairytale my way
[01:49.81]Been living in a fantasy without meaning
[01:53.88]It's not okay I don't feel safe
