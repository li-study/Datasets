[00:35.35]I count the falling tears
[00:38.27]That fall before my eyes
[00:42.33]Seems like a thousand years
[00:45.59]Since we broke the ties
[00:49.50]I call you on the phone
[00:52.68]But I never get a rise
[00:56.58]So sit there all alone

[01:38.82]Searchin' for a change of pace
[01:42.39]Life needs to be sweetened
[01:46.55]I sang my heart out just to make a dime
