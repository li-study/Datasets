[00:11.19]Isn't it rich?
[00:15.97]Are we a pair?
[00:19.94]Me here at last on the ground,
[00:24.29]You in mid-air..
[00:29.70]Send in the clowns.
[00:33.62]
[00:39.13]Isn't it bliss?
[00:43.42]Don't you approve?
[00:47.35]One who keeps tearing around,
[00:51.43]One who can't move...
[00:57.00]Where are the clowns?
[01:01.77]Send in the clowns.
[01:06.05]
[01:06.65]Just when I'd stopped opening doors,
[01:13.86]Finally knowing the one
[01:16.29]that I wanted was yours.
[01:21.25]Making my entrance
[01:23.47]again with my usual flair
[01:29.12]Sure of my lines...
[01:35.99]No one is there.
[01:40.28]
[01:45.65]Don't you love farce?
[01:49.97]My fault, I fear.
[01:53.83]I thought that you'd want what I want...
[01:57.96]Sorry, my dear!
[02:04.05]And where are the clowns
[02:08.16]There are to be the clowns
[02:12.49]quick,send in the clowns
[02:16.90]what a surprise who could foresee
[02:24.63]I'd come to feel about you
[02:27.44]What you felt about me?
[02:32.72]Why only now when I see
[02:35.20]That you've drifted away?
[02:41.19]What a surprise...
[02:48.41]What a cliche...
[02:57.30]
[03:17.43]isn't it rich,isn't it queer
[03:26.08]losing my timing this late is my career
[03:36.42]and where are the clowns
[03:40.69]quick send in the clowns
