[00:02.00]Judas Priest - Visions
[00:05.00]
[00:11.51]Anvils ignite
[00:15.72]Once again
[00:18.68]I watch them dance around the plain
[00:23.20]Sparks start to fly
[00:26.35]I can't speak
[00:28.77]From seeing answers that I seek
[00:38.18]Shapes start to form
[00:42.42]As I stare
[00:45.08]The shadows taunt as if to dare
[00:49.85]Ghostly embrace takes my heart
[00:55.55]Now I surrender and it starts
[04:33.40][04:11.41][01:55.94][01:04.85]Visions in the night
[04:36.31][04:15.01][01:59.49][01:09.13]Show me what is right
[04:38.97][04:17.87][02:02.30][01:11.67]Help me through the maze
[04:41.72][04:20.46][02:04.87][01:14.41]...of mystery
[04:44.09][04:23.22][02:07.31][01:16.66]I would sell my soul
[04:46.99][04:25.73][02:10.30][01:19.32]If only I could know
[04:49.62][04:28.39][02:12.98][01:22.11]What the future holds
[04:52.58][04:30.96][02:15.57][01:24.71]And what will be
[01:31.50]Slowly my hand (my hand)
[01:36.28]Turns the page (the page)
[01:38.84]It never ceases to amaze
[01:42.44]Fill me with hope (with hope)
[01:46.30]If you can (fill me with hope)
[01:49.09]I will become a better man
[02:22.52]Visions come
[02:27.37]Into my mind
[02:32.55]Foretell the future
[02:37.72]Of mankind
[03:04.30]Only time will prove that I'm right
[03:11.50]Will my words come true (will my words come true)
[03:16.72]I can't deny the gift of foresight (I can't deny)
[03:21.46]There's nothing I can do
