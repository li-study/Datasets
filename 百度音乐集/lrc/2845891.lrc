[00:00.00]Sanctus Real--We Need Each Other
[00:05.93]BY Larry Cheng & Kevin Boul
[00:13.48]
[00:13.96]I think I caught a glimpse of
[00:17.30]Life without friends
[00:20.66]Bitter, empty, hollow, dark and lonely
[00:27.43]We never meant to hurt each other
[00:30.63]So Can’t we trust again
[00:34.07]And take it as a chance
[00:36.80]To keep on growing
[00:38.69]
[00:41.09]I don’t know why it doesn’t come easy
[00:44.22]But I know that we could be happy
[00:47.63]If we’d only learn to love
[00:53.21]
[00:54.60]Oh oh we need each other
[00:58.01]So what’s the fighting for
[01:01.37]Oh oh we need each other
[01:04.95]Please don’t close the door
[01:08.32]Oh oh we need each other
[01:11.32]Through all the highs and lows
[01:14.64]Oh oh we need each other
[01:18.11]Cuz no one’s meant to live alone
[01:21.63]
[01:27.82]Life revolves around the need
[01:30.82]Of having someone
[01:34.23]Causing every complicated feeling
[01:40.11]Oh and I don’t want to loose you
[01:44.22]And there is nothing wrong with
[01:47.10]Telling me what you need
[01:50.97]To keep our love strong
[01:53.80]
[01:54.66]It’s just a part of being a family
[01:57.76]Taking the good with the bad and the ugly
[02:01.18]If we could only learn to love
[02:06.67]
[02:08.17]Oh oh we need each other
[02:11.59]So what’s the fighting for
[02:14.86]Oh oh we need each other
[02:18.77]Please don’t close the door
[02:21.80]Oh oh we need each other
[02:24.77]Through all the highs and lows
[02:28.25]Oh oh we need each other
[02:31.93]Cuz I don’t want to be alone
[02:34.65]
[02:48.61]Oh Oh we need each other
[02:52.94]Fathers and Mothers
[02:55.23]Oh oh we need each other
[02:58.81]All your sisters and brothers
[03:01.84]Oh oh we need each other
[03:05.58]We need friends and lovers
[03:08.62]Oh Oh we need each other
[03:11.35]
[03:16.03]Well I need you
[03:17.69]You need me
[03:19.38]Cuz that’s the way
[03:20.97]It’s meant to be
[03:22.73]I need you
[03:24.43]We need each other
[03:27.59](I don’t want to be alone)
[03:30.98]Well I need you
[03:31.73]You need me
[03:33.39]Cuz that’s the way
[03:35.05]It’s meant to be
[03:36.87]I need you
[03:38.42]We need each other
[03:41.47](I don’t want to be alone)
