[00:20.37]We played outside in the pouring rain
[00:25.70]On our way up the road we started over again

[00:35.62]My mind is achin'....Lord it won't stop
[00:40.31]Thats how it happens....Livin' life by the drop
[00:43.70]
[00:49.58]Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
[00:55.00]Talkin' 'bout good things and signin' the blues
[00:59.36]You went your way....I stayed behind
[01:04.26]We both knew it was just a matter of time
[01:05.60]

[01:14.40]My mind is achin'....Lord it won't stop
[01:18.84]That's how it happens....Livin' life by the drop

[01:32.87]Churnin' up the past....There's no easier way
