[00:20.72]To be completely honest
[00:23.48]It scares me to imagine
[00:26.42]What life would be without you
[00:29.91]
[00:30.95]And for this very reason
[00:33.88]I ask you to forgive me
[00:36.42]For what I'm putting us through
[00:39.76]
[00:40.43]Although there are so many things
[00:45.09]Against us, I've decided
[00:49.15]That I'm not giving you up, no...
[00:59.10]
[01:10.76]Thinking back, I see what we have
[01:13.78]Is something different
[01:16.16]I think we've known all along
[01:19.85]So how fair would it be
[01:22.12]To divide this love's existence
[01:26.22]Between what's right and what's wrong
[01:29.48]
[01:29.70]And you, always wondering if we'll make it
[01:34.84]Time will tell you
[01:38.27]That I'm not giving you up, no, no...
[01:44.46]
[01:50.07]We'll find a way to be together
[01:54.72]However long it takes, wherever
[01:59.79]If it means having you for only a moment
[02:04.64]A moment just might be enough
[02:07.98]I'm not giving you up, no
[02:17.37]No I'm not giving you up, no
[02:26.56]
[02:38.65]Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken
[02:43.92]Come back to haunt me, false and broken
[02:48.45]Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever
[02:53.66]Searching for water in the desert
[02:57.97]
[02:58.29]No, I refuse to have to do
[03:02.74]Without your kisses
[03:06.47]I'm not giving you up, no, no
[03:16.53]
[03:18.54]We'll find a way to be together
[03:23.28]However long it takes, wherever
[03:28.53]If it means having you for only a moment
[03:32.53]A moment just might be enough
[03:36.18]I'm not giving you up, no
[03:39.72]
[03:45.56]No I'm not giving you up, no
[04:05.34]No I'm not giving you up
[04:12.12]
