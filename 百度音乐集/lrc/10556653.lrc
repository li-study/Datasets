[00:17.04]I always needed time on my own
[00:21.33]I never thought I\'d need you there when I cry
[00:29.07]And the days feel like years when I\'m alone
[00:35.10]And the bed where you lie
[00:38.20]is made up on your side
[00:42.85]When you walk away
[00:46.10]I count the steps that you take
[00:49.98]Do you see how much I need you right now?
[00:55.80]When you\'re gone
[00:58.30]The pieces of my heart are missing you
[01:02.41]When you\'re gone
[01:05.03]The face I came to know is missing too
[01:09.23]When you\'re gone
[01:11.25]The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
[01:19.16]And make it OK
[01:23.15]I miss you

[01:37.52]I never felt this way before
[01:42.67]Everything that I do
[01:46.11]reminds me of you
[01:51.07]And the clothes you left
[01:53.19]are lyin\' on the floor
[01:56.68]And they smell just like you
[01:59.84]I love the things that you do
[02:04.73]When you walk away
[02:07.74]I count the steps that you take
[02:11.92]Do you see how much I need you right now?
[02:17.98]When you\'re gone
[02:19.64]The pieces of my heart are missing you
[02:24.46]When you\'re gone
[02:26.43]The face I came to know is missing too
[02:31.24]When you\'re gone
[02:33.06]The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
[02:41.00]And make it OK
[02:44.43]I miss you
[02:47.25]We were meant for each other
[02:50.74]I keep forever
[02:54.38]I know we were
[02:57.85]Yeah~~
[02:59.52]All I ever wanted was for you to know
[03:02.77]Everything I do I give my heart and soul
[03:06.42]I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me
[03:10.73]Yeah~~
[03:13.02]When you\'re gone
[03:14.77]The pieces of my heart are missing you
