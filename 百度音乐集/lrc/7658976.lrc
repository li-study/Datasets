[00:04.59]
[00:21.82]Ricky was a young boy,
[00:25.11]He had a heart of stone.
[00:27.55]Lived 9 to 5 and worked
[00:29.68]his fingers to the bone.
[00:32.59]Just barely got out of school
[00:35.49]came from the edge of town.
[00:38.01]Fought like a switchblade
[00:39.77]so no one could take him down.
[00:43.18]He had no money, oooh no good at home.
[00:47.97]He walked the streets a soldier
[00:49.98]and he fought the world alone
[00:52.93]And now it's
[00:54.48]18 and life You got it

[01:25.82]Tequila in his heartbeat,
[01:28.30]His veins burned gasoline.
[01:31.15]It kept his motor running
[01:33.56]but it never kept him clean.
[01:36.37]They say he loved adventure,
[01:38.82]"Ricky's the wild one."
[01:41.61]He married trouble and
[01:44.21]had a courtship with a gun.
[01:46.97]Bang Bang Shoot 'em up,
[01:49.33]The party never ends.
[01:51.79]You can't think of dying
[01:54.07]when the bottle's your best friend
[01:56.67]And now it's
