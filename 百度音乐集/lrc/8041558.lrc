[00:06.00]豆豆，我们相爱一年了，OH YEAH
[00:49.13]I\'ve got you under my skin
[00:59.34]I have got you deep in the heart of me
[01:09.84]So deep in my heart, you\'re really a part of me
[01:20.16]And I\'ve got you under my skin
[01:31.35]I have tried so, not to give in
[01:41.81]I\'ve said to myself this affair it never would go so well
[01:52.41]But why should I try to resist when I know so well
[02:03.19]That I\'ve got you under my skin
[02:12.90]I would sacrifice anything come would might
[02:18.61]For the sake of having you near
[02:23.53]In spite of a warning voice, that comes in the night and repeats in my ear
[02:33.80]Don\'t you know you fool you never can win
[02:43.41]Use your mentality, wake up to reality
[02:54.94]For each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
[03:05.91]Because I\'ve got you under my skin
