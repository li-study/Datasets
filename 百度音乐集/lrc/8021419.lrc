[00:14.80]Chimes sing Sunday morn
[00:18.90]Today's the day she's sworn
[00:23.54]To steal what she never could own
[00:28.09]And race from this hole she calls home
[00:37.65]
[00:38.78]Now you're at the wheel
[00:42.00]Tell me how, how does it feel?
[00:46.77]So good to have equalised
[00:51.26]To lift up the lids of your eyes
[00:55.89]
[01:00.72]As the mile they disappear
[01:05.37]See land begin to clear
[01:10.20]Free from the filth and the scum
[01:14.35]This American satelites won
[01:23.57]
[01:24.45]She'll carry on through it all
[01:28.29]She's a waterfall
[01:32.53]
[01:33.82]She'll carry on through it all
[01:37.27]She's a waterfall
[01:39.69]
[01:42.69]See the steeple pine
[01:47.35]The hills as old as time
[01:52.00]Soon to be put to the test
[01:56.69]To be whipped by the winds of the west
[02:03.00]
[02:06.23]Stands on shifting sands
[02:10.51]The scales held in her hands
[02:14.80]The wind it just whips her away
[02:19.84]And fills up her brigantine sails
[02:25.69]
[02:29.24]She'll carry on through it all
[02:33.06]She's a waterfall
[02:38.82]She'll carry on through it all
[02:41.48]
[02:42.82]She's a waterfall
