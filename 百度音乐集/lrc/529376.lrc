[00:04.68]
[00:15.58]This old man and me, were at the bar and we
[00:22.21]Were having us some beers and swaping I don't cares
[00:28.95]Talking politics, blonde and red-head chicks
[00:35.77]Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked
[00:41.42]
[00:42.59]We talked about Gods grace and all the hell we raised
[00:49.77]Then I heard the ol' man say;
[00:56.04]God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
[01:03.18]
[01:09.46]He said "I fought two wars,
[01:12.40]Been married and divorced"
[01:15.79]What brings you to Ohio?
[01:20.04]He said "Damned if I know"
[01:23.02]We talked an hour or two
[01:26.34]about every girl we knew
[01:29.57]What all we put them through
[01:32.67]Like two old boys will do
[01:35.26]
[01:36.53]We pondered life an death
[01:39.70]He light a cigarette
[01:43.20]He said "These damn things will kill me yet;
[01:50.09]But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
[01:57.22]
[01:59.92]Last call its 2am,
[02:03.54]I said goodbye to him
[02:07.06]I never talk to him again
[02:15.62]Then one sunny day,
[02:19.21]I saw the old mans face
[02:21.71]Front page Obituary,
[02:25.98]he was a millionaree
[02:29.38]he left his fortune to
[02:32.53]some guy he barely knew,
[02:36.02]his kids were mad as hell
[02:38.80]But me, I'm doing well
[02:42.37]And I drop by today,
[02:45.82]to just say thanks and pray,
[02:49.69]I left a six-pack right there on his grave
[02:54.29]and i said; God is great,
[02:57.71]beer is good, and people are crazy.
[03:03.44]
[03:09.71]God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.
[03:18.17]
[03:23.21]God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.
