[00:03.38]Billy Joel

[00:22.99]Viktor was born in the spring of '44
[00:29.28]And never saw his father anymore
[00:35.82]A child of sacrifice, a child of war
[00:42.64]Another son who never had a father after Leningrad
[00:48.79]
[00:50.39]Went off to school and learned to serve the state
[00:56.55]Followed the rules and drank his vodka straight
[01:03.60]The only way to live was drown the hate
[01:09.79]A Russian life was very sad
[01:14.52]And such was life in Leningrad
[01:18.47]
[01:20.71]I was born in '49
[01:23.88]A cold war kid in McCarthy time
[01:27.22]Stop 'em all at the 38th Parallel
[01:30.77]Blast those yellow reds to hell
[01:34.14]And cold war kids were hard to kill
[01:37.63]Under their desks in an air raid drill
[01:41.04]Haven't they heard we won the war
[01:44.48]What do they keep on fighting for?
[01:47.89]
[01:50.64]Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
[01:57.51]Served out his time, became a circus clown
[02:04.63]The greatest happiness he'd ever found
[02:10.58]Was making Russian children glad
[02:15.40]And children lived in Leningrad
[02:19.17]
[02:21.41]But children lived in Levittown
[02:24.26]And hid in the shelters underground
[02:27.71]Until the Soviets turned their ships around
[02:31.61]And tore the Cuban missiles down
[02:34.54]And in that bright October sun
[02:38.05]We knew our childhood days were done
[02:41.18]And I watched my friends go off to war
[02:44.92]What do they keep on fighting for?
[02:47.41]
[02:51.00]And so my child and I came to this place
[02:56.43]To meet him eye to eye and face to face
[03:04.62]He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced
[03:10.26]We never knew what friends we had
[03:14.62]Until we came to Leningrad
