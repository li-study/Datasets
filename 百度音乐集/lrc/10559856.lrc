[00:03.22]I’ve been waiting for my dreams
[00:06.67]To turn into something
[00:08.81]I could believe in
[00:11.36]And looking for that
[00:13.85]Magic rainbow
[00:16.00]On the horizon
[00:18.22]I couldn’t see it
[00:20.70]Until I let go
[00:22.80]Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn
[00:29.49]Now I’m coming alive
[00:32.15]Body and soul
[00:34.38]And feelin’ my world start to turn
[00:38.18]
[00:38.89]And I’ll taste every moment
[00:41.54]And live it out loud
[00:43.65]I know this is the time,
[00:45.93]This is the time
[00:48.06]To be more than a name
[00:50.59]Or a face in the crowd
[00:52.84]I know this is the time
[00:55.47]This is the time of my life
[01:00.71]Time of my life
[01:04.71]
[01:06.78]Holding onto things that vanished
[01:11.83]Into the air
[01:13.95]Left me in pieces
[01:16.09]But now I’m rising from the ashes
[01:21.17]Finding my wings
[01:23.29]And all that I needed
[01:25.58]Was there all along
[01:27.86]Within my reach
[01:30.35]As close as the beat of my heart
[01:34.38]And I’ll taste every moment
[01:36.92]And live it out loud
[01:39.17]I know this is the time,
[01:41.78]This is the time to be
[01:44.18]More than a name
[01:46.27]Or a face in the crowd
[01:48.48]I know this is the time
[01:51.00]This is the time of my life
[01:55.83]Time of my life
[02:01.97]And I’m out on the edge of forever
[02:05.92]Ready to run
[02:12.33]Keeping my feet on the ground
[02:15.63]My arms open wide
[02:18.48]Face to the sun
[02:21.34]I’ll taste every moment
[02:23.54]And live it out loud
[02:25.83]I know this is the time,
[02:28.40]This is the time to be
[02:30.79]More than a name
[02:32.80]Or a face in the crowd
[02:34.81]I know this is the time
[02:38.99]This is the time of my life
[02:40.70]My life
[02:49.02]More than a name
[02:51.42]Or a face in the crowd
[02:53.52]I know this is the time
[02:56.18]This is the time of my life
[03:02.67]This is the time of my life
[03:11.76]Time of my life
[03:20.66]Time of my life
