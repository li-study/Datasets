[00:01]Early in the morning, risin' to the street,
[00:06]Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet.
[00:11]Got to find a reason, reason things went wrong.
[00:16]Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.
[00:21]I got a dalmation and I can still get high.
[00:26]I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot.
[00:42]Life is too short so love the one you got cause you might get run over,
[00:46]or you might get shot.
[00:48]Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.
[00:50]Never start no static I just get it off my chest.
[00:53]Take a small example, a tip from me..
[00:55]take all of your money and give it up to charity.
[00:58]Lovin's what I got, It's within my reach
[01:01](and the sublime style is still straight from long beach)
[01:03]It all comes back to you you're gonna get what you deserve.
[01:05]Try and test that, you're bound to get served.
[01:08]Love's what I got, don't start a riot, You feel it when the dance gets hot.
[02:34][02:30][02:24][02:19][02:13][02:08][02:03][01:58][01:19][01:13]Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that.
[01:34]Why I don't cry when my dog runs away.
[01:37]I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay.
[01:40]I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot,
[01:42]hits that botte and goes back to the rock.
[01:45]Fuckin and fighting it's all the same.
[01:47]Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane.
[01:50]Let the lovin come back to me.
