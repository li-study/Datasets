[00:14.34]Ramblin' where to begin
[00:17.35]I taste the summer on your peppery skin
[00:20.46]Been saved the warmer the waves
[00:23.43]I felt a slip into a watery grave
[00:27.36]
[00:39.19]My girl, linen and curls
[00:42.40]Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
[00:45.61]She's grand the bend of her hand
[00:48.59]Digging deep into the sweep of the sand
[00:52.30]
[01:05.66]Summer arrives with a length of lights
[01:18.25]Summer blows away
[01:24.37]And quietly gets swallowed by a wave
[01:32.24]It gets swallowed by a wave
[01:35.80]
[01:40.61]Waylay the din of the day
[01:43.66]Boats bobbing in the blue of the bay
[01:46.84]In deep far beneath all the dead sailors
[01:51.04]Slowly slipping to sleep
[01:53.76]
[02:06.17]My girl, linen and curls
[02:08.85]Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
[02:12.05]She's grand the bend of her hand
[02:15.17]Digging deep into the sweep of the sand
[02:18.94]
[02:32.07]Summer arrives with a length of lights
[02:44.97]Summer blows away
[02:50.88]And quietly gets swallowed by a wave
[02:59.07]It gets swallowed by a wave...
