[00:00.24]Eddie Vedder - Once in a While
[00:00.55]
[00:01.62]Once in a while will you try to give
[00:05.86]One little thought to me
[00:09.94]Though someone else may be
[00:13.17]Nearer to your heart?
[00:15.01]
[00:16.06]Will you dream of the moments
[00:19.12]I shared with you
[00:21.53]Before we drifted apart
[00:23.91]Once in a while?
[00:27.30]
[00:30.78]In love's smoldering embers
[00:35.07]One spark may remain
[00:37.67]If love still can remember
[00:41.02]The spark may burn again
[00:47.39]I know that I'll be contented
[00:52.35]With yesterday's memory
[00:55.76]Knowing you think of me
[00:58.16]Once in a while
[01:01.38]
[01:05.03]In love's smoldering embers
[01:09.13]One spark may remain
[01:11.77]If love still can remember
[01:15.22]The spark may burn again
[01:21.64]I know that I'll be contented
[01:27.00]With yesterday's memory
[01:30.24]Knowing you think of me
[01:33.17]Once in a while
[01:39.57]
