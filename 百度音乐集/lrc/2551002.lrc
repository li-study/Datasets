[00:09.50]by leetiran
[00:13.88]You made up your mind
[00:16.29]It was time it was over
[00:20.20]After we've had come so far
[00:27.03]But I think there's enough
[00:29.67]Pieces of forgiveness
[00:33.68]Somewhere in my broken heart
[00:39.39]
[00:40.84]I would not have chosen
[00:43.78]The road you have taken
[00:47.24]It has left us miles apart
[00:54.01]But I think I can still find
[00:57.23]The will to keep going
[01:00.62]Somewhere in my broken heart
[01:05.82]
[01:07.54]So fly Go ahead and fly
[01:14.77]Till you find out who you are
[01:21.14]And I,I will keep my love unspoken
[01:28.55]Somewhere in my broken heart
[01:34.16]
[01:34.89]I hope that in time you will find
[01:39.08]What you long for
[01:41.35]Love that's written in the stars
[01:47.76]When you finally leave
[01:50.54]I think you will see it
[01:54.89]Somewhere in my broken heart
[01:58.61]
[02:15.35]Girl,I will keep my love unspoken
[02:21.25]Somewhere in my broken heart
[02:26.94]
[02:28.79]I hope that in time you will find
[02:33.23]What you long for
[02:35.63]Love that's written in the stars
[02:42.29]When you finally leave
[02:45.15]I think you will see it
[02:49.07]Somewhere in my broken
[02:52.51]Somewhere in my broken
[02:55.74]Somewhere in my broken heart
