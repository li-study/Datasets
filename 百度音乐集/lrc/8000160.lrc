[00:02.95]Gnarls Barkley
[00:03.40]
[00:04.08]I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
[00:09.78]There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:13.20]Even your emotions had an echo
[00:15.23]In so much space
[00:17.23]
[00:21.23]And when you're out there
[00:22.53]Without care,
[00:23.48]Yeah, I was out of touch
[00:25.69]But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[00:32.20]I just knew too much
[00:34.36]
[00:36.66]Does that make me crazy
[00:41.09]Does that make me crazy
[00:45.28]Does that make me crazy
[00:49.69]Possibly
[00:55.15]
[00:55.30]And I hope that you are having the time of your life
[01:02.96]But think twice, that's my only advice
[01:09.34]
[01:11.58]Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
[01:18.48]Ha ha ha bless your soul
[01:23.35]You really think you're in control
[01:26.52]
[01:27.57]Well, I think you're crazy
[01:32.54]I think you're crazy
[01:36.80]I think you're crazy
[01:41.10]Just like me
[01:46.13]
[01:47.28]My heroes had the heart to Lose their lives out on a limb
[01:54.39]And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
[02:02.39]Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
[02:09.75]And it's no coincidence I've come
[02:15.03]And I can die when I'm done
[02:17.50]
[02:19.61]Maybe I'm crazy
[02:23.99]Maybe you're crazy
[02:28.31]Maybe we're crazy
[02:32.58]Probably
[02:38.11]
