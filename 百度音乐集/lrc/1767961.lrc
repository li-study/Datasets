[00:00.00]Back From Mars
[00:04.33]Hey you, come with me, to a world of billionaires
[00:14.56]See me, I'm da bomb, drinking champagne down at Pierre's
[00:24.57]All the people that I'm meeting, are so friendly and perceiving
[00:31.76]When they smile
[00:35.25]Some are talking 'bout their feelings, and the stocks that they are dealing
[00:41.97]So they cry, don't wanna say bye
[00:49.19]I am coming back from Mars, where they drive in fancy cars
[00:56.12]And the King he is okay, he is coming home today
[01:03.05]I am coming back from Mars, where there are no cheap cigars
[01:10.05]And Elvis has said, that I could be just like they are
[01:17.20]Meet the stars - they're from Mars
[01:32.37]Baby, it's glamour, throwing bills up in the air
[01:42.53]Back off, I'm too hot, eat the oysters if you dare
[01:52.51]Saying hi to Mister Shoe Shine, passes by a Missus Diva
[01:59.33]Stop and stare
[02:02.58]This is oh so just fantastic, I will live my life in plastic
[02:09.53]Check the hair, and see what I wear
[02:16.58]I am coming back from Mars, where they drive in fancy cars
[02:24.27]And the King he is okay, he is coming home today
[02:31.24]I am coming back from Mars, where there are no cheap cigars
[02:38.24]And Elvis has said, that I could be just like they are
[02:45.22]Meet the stars - they're from Mars
[03:00.90]We are porno stars, sucking big cigars
[03:07.22]We are the pop stars, we cannot play giutars
[03:14.23]I am coming back from Mars, where they drive in fancy cars
[03:22.85]And the King he is okay, he is coming home today
[03:29.75]I am coming back from Mars, where there are no cheap cigars
[03:37.89]And Elvis has said, that I could be just like they are
[03:44.31]Meet the stars - they're from Mars
