[00:00.00]No Doubt - Underneath It All
[00:20.94]
[00:22.94]There's times where I want something more
[00:25.97]Someone more like me
[00:29.44]There's times when this dress rehearsal
[00:32.56]Seems incomplete
[00:35.72]But, you see the colors in me like no one else
[00:43.16]And behind your dark glasses you're...
[00:46.98]You're something else
[03:50.41][03:22.84][01:45.84][00:50.63]You're really lovely
[03:54.78][03:27.26][01:50.29][00:55.13]Underneath it all
[03:57.40][03:29.55][01:53.04][00:57.90]You want to love me
[04:01.67][03:34.05][01:57.10][01:01.85]Underneath it all
[04:04.32][03:36.54][01:59.90][01:04.58]I'm really lucky
[04:08.51][03:41.09][02:04.25][01:08.77]Underneath it all
[03:43.54][02:06.79][01:11.49]You're really lovely
[01:16.13]
[01:18.14]You know some real bad tricks
[01:20.77]And you need some discipline
[01:24.19]But, lately you've been trying real hard
[01:27.70]And giving me your best
[01:31.07]And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
[01:35.02]That I've ever had
[01:38.53]And when it's really bad
[01:41.20]I guess it's not that bad
[02:11.63]
[02:13.72]So many moons that we have seen
[02:17.04]Stumbling back next to me
[02:20.52]I've seen right through and underneath
[02:23.90]And you make me better
[02:27.41]I've seen right through and underneath
[02:30.97]And you make me better
[02:34.25]Better... better...
[02:38.41]Coz underneath it all,
[02:39.89]You are my real Prince Charmin'
[02:41.88]Like the heat from the fire
[02:43.51]You were always burnin'
[02:45.25]And each time you're around
[02:47.20]My body keeps callin'
[02:48.64]For your touch
[02:49.75]Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
[02:52.19]There's an underside to you
[02:53.83]That so many adore
[02:55.84]Aside from your temper
[02:57.46]Everything else secure
[02:59.10]You're good for me, baby
[03:01.03]Oh that, I'm sure
[03:02.74]Coz over and over again
[03:04.46]I want more
[03:06.98]You've used up all your coupons
[03:09.77]And all you've got left is me
[03:13.77]And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
[03:16.62]I guess it's meant to be
[04:11.09]And you're really lovely
[04:15.98]
