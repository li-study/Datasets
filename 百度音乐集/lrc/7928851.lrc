[00:05.00]Damien Rice
[00:08.00]
[00:15.00]Nothing unusual, nothing strange
[00:20.90]Close to nothing at all
[00:28.00]The same old scenario, the same old rain
[00:34.89]And there's no explosions here
[00:42.01]Then something unusual, something strange
[00:48.91]Comes from nothing at all
[00:55.31]I saw a spaceship fly by your window
[01:01.33]Did you see it disappear?
[01:06.33]
[01:08.61]Amie come sit on my wall
[01:14.92]And read me the story of O
[01:21.59]And tell it like you still believe
[01:26.76]That the end of the century
[01:30.95]Brings a change for you and me
[01:36.45]Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
[01:43.24]Just a little older that's all
[01:49.23]You know when you've found it,
[01:52.01]There's something I've learned
[01:55.78]'Cause you feel it when they take it away
[02:01.20]
[02:03.95]Something unusual, something strange
[02:10.30]Comes from nothing at all
[02:16.09]But I'm not a miracle
[02:20.03]And you're not a saint
[02:22.70]Just another soldier
[02:26.02]On the road to nowhere
[02:29.07]
[02:29.91]Amie come sit on my wall
[02:36.22]And read me the story of O
[02:42.88]And tell it like you still believe
[02:48.32]That the end of the century
[02:52.99]Brings a change for you and me
[02:57.00]
[02:57.45]And Amie come sit on my wall
[03:03.85]And read me the story of O
[03:10.91]And tell it like you still believe
[03:15.95]That the end of the century
[03:20.24]Brings a change for you and me
[03:26.75]
