[00:25.45]The falling leaves
[00:33.96]Drift by the window
[00:41.36]The autumn leaves
[00:45.81]Of red and gold
[00:53.45]I see your lips
[01:00.46]The summer kisses
[01:06.09]The sunburned hands
[01:10.05]I used to hold
[01:20.05]Since you went away
[01:26.04]The days grow long
[01:33.00]And soon i'll hear
[01:39.00]Old winter's song
[01:47.00]But i miss you most of all
[01:57.05]My darling
[02:03.08]When autumn leaves
[02:06.50]Start to fall
[02:11.89]
[03:05.05]Since you went away
[03:11.54]The days grow long
[03:18.62]And soon i'll hear
[03:25.30]Old winter's song
[03:34.10]But i miss you most of all
[03:44.40]My darling
[03:51.83]When autumn leaves
[03:56.41]Start to fall
[04:01.30]i miss you most of all
[04:11.90]My darling
[04:18.40]When autumn leaves
[04:26.00]Start to fall
