
[00:01.73]Fade Into You
[00:03.44]Mazzy Star
[00:05.89]
[00:20.27]I want to hold the hand inside you
[00:29.43]I want to take a breath that's true
[00:38.59]I look to you and I see nothing
[00:47.67]I look to you to see the truth
[00:56.91]You live your life, you go in shadows
[01:06.17]You'll come apart and you'll go black
[01:15.22]Some kind of night into your darkness
[01:24.42]Colors your eyes with what's not there
[01:29.71]
[01:33.78]Fade into you
[01:42.26]Strange you never knew
[01:51.49]Fade into you
[02:00.74]I think it's strange you never knew
[02:05.77]
[02:46.45]A stranger's light comes on slowly
[02:55.81]A stranger's heart without a home
[03:05.04]You put your hands into your head
[03:14.12]And then smiles cover your heart
[03:18.99]
[03:23.12]Fade into you
[03:32.01]Strange you never knew
[03:41.36]Fade into you
[03:50.87]I think it's strange you never knew
[03:57.61]
[03:59.68]Fade into you
[04:08.95]Strange you never knew
[04:18.16]Fade into you
[04:27.72]I think it's strange you never knew
[04:36.60]I think it's strange you never knew
[04:42.95]
