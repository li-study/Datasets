[00:00.00]Natasha Bedingfield - When You Know You Know
[00:06.56]You taught me a lesson about love today
[00:19.64]Love is not a castle in the clouds
[00:22.92]Coz there's a storm, it'll all come crashing down
[00:28.18]I'd rather find it like a penny on the ground
[00:31.36]Coz that's something I can keep and carry around
[00:36.80]Truth is not a feather blowin' round in the wind
[00:40.50]It's that jump in your heart, goosebumps on your skin
[00:45.28]Just pinch me if it's really happening
[00:47.45]Coz I'm more awake than I've ever been
[00:51.29]And you're the one from my dream
[00:53.93]You're out of my mind
[00:56.07]And into my heart
[00:58.31]You're more than a feeling
[01:00.58]More than I could have thought
[01:02.89]I can't deny, I can't say love never comes
[01:06.71]All I know is, when you know, you know
[01:09.93]And I just know
[01:13.92]That love has come in the form of you
[01:18.49]If someone put me on a witness stand
[01:22.44]I'd point to you, a hardcore evidence
[01:28.12]You're proof that you don't have to understand
[01:30.32]You can still fall into the right hands
[01:34.02]You're the one in my dreams
[01:36.95]You're out of my mind
[01:38.55]And into my heart
[01:41.08]You're more than a feeling
[01:43.36]More than I could have thought
[01:45.87]I can't deny, I can't say love never comes
[01:49.21]All I know is, when you know, you know
[01:53.80]I was a doubter
[01:58.00]A typical, won't believe til I see
[02:02.37]Oh so grounded, to think that someone like you
[02:10.55]Couldn't be right in front of me
[02:21.29]I can't deny,
[02:24.29]All I know is, when you know, you know
[02:27.66]And i know is
[02:30.26]You're out of my mind
[02:33.32]You're more than a feeling
[02:34.66]Oh Yeah Yeah oh oh oh oh i cant deny
[02:41.48]All I know is, when you know, you know,
[02:45.50]And I just know
