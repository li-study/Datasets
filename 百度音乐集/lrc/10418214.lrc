[00:14.78]You walk into the room
[00:18.03]With your pencil in your hand
[00:21.36]You see somebody naked
[00:25.02]And you say, Who is that man?
[00:27.70]You try so hard
[00:29.63]But you don't understand
[00:34.02]Just what you'll say
[00:36.17]When you get home
[00:40.43]Because something is happening here
[00:43.41]But you don't know what it is
[00:47.23]Do you, Mister Jones?
[00:57.10]You raise up your head
[01:00.33]And you ask, Is this where it is?
[01:04.10]And somebody points to you and says
[01:10.61]It's his
[01:11.56]And you say, What's mine?
[01:12.84]And somebody else says, Where what is?
[01:16.21]And you say, Oh my God
[01:18.15]Am I here all alone?
[01:22.96]Because something is happening here
[01:25.97]But you don't know what it is
[01:30.13]Do you, Mister Jones?
[01:40.04]You hand in your ticket
[01:43.75]And you go watch the geek
[01:46.76]Who immediately walks up to you
[01:49.91]When he hears you speak
[01:53.10]And says, How does it feel
[01:54.60]To be such a freak?
[01:59.32]And you say, Impossible
[02:00.58]As he hands you a bone
[02:05.84]Because something is happening here
[02:09.79]But you don't know what it is
[02:13.13]Do you, Mister Jones?
[02:22.87]You have many contacts
[02:26.81]Among the lumberjacks
[02:29.03]To get you facts
[02:30.34]When someone attacks your imagination
[02:35.89]But nobody has any respect
[02:38.72]Anyway they already expect you
[02:42.87]To just give a check
[02:44.47]To tax-deductible charity organizations
[02:53.95]You've been with the professors
[02:57.39]And they've all liked your looks
[03:01.89]With great lawyers you have
[03:04.33]Discussed lepers and crooks
[03:07.94]You've been through all of
[03:09.87]F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
[03:13.91]You're very well read
[03:16.21]It's well known
[03:20.60]Because something is happening here
[03:25.23]But you don't know what it is
[03:27.03]Do you, Mister Jones?
[03:35.49]Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
[03:40.20]And then he kneels
[03:43.67]He crosses himself
[03:45.64]And then he clicks his high heels
[03:49.41]And without further notice
[03:52.03]He asks you how it feels
[03:55.09]And he says, Here is your throat back
[03:57.64]Thanks for the loan
[04:03.27]Because something is happening here
[04:06.21]But you don't know what it is
[04:09.13]Do you, Mister Jones?
[04:17.64]Now you see this one-eyed midget
[04:21.93]Shouting the word NOW
[04:26.27]And you say, For what reason?
[04:28.44]And he says, How?
[04:31.92]And you say, What does this mean?
[04:33.84]And he screams back, You're a cow
[04:39.65]Give me some milk
[04:41.14]Or else go home
[04:43.87]Because something is happening here
[04:47.21]But you don't know what it is
[04:50.79]Do you, Mister Jones?
[04:59.65]Well, you walk into the room
[05:03.17]Like a camel and then you frown
[05:08.42]You put your eyes in your pocket
[05:13.12]And your nose on the ground
[05:14.72]There ought to be a law
[05:17.15]Against you comin' around
[05:20.22]You should be made
[05:21.93]To wear earphones
[05:28.21]Because something is happening here
[05:33.83]But you don't know what it is
[05:35.33]Do you, Mister Jones?
