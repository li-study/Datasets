[00:04.50]Beautiful Stranger
[00:13.50]Haven't we met?
[00:17.50]Somekind of beautiful stranger
[00:20.50]You could be good for me
[00:25.50]I've had the taste for danger
[00:30.50]If I'm smart then I'll run away
[00:34.50]But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
[00:37.50]Heaven forbid
[00:40.50]I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger
[00:46.50]I looked into your eyes
[00:49.50]And my world came tumbling down
[00:54.50]You're the devil in disguise
[00:57.50]That's why I'm singing this song
[01:02.50]To know you
[01:06.50]Is to love you
[01:09.50]You're everywhere I go
[01:13.50]And everybody knows
[01:18.50]To love you
[01:22.50]Is to be part of you
[01:25.50]I paid for you with my tears
[01:29.50]And swallowed my pride
[01:38.50]Beautiful stranger...
[01:44.50]Beautiful stranger...
[01:53.50]If I'm smart then I'll run away
[01:57.50]But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
[01:59.50]Haven't you heard?
[02:01.50]I fell in love with a beautiful stranger
[02:08.50]I looked into your face
[02:11.50]My heart was dancing all over the place
[02:16.50]I'd like to change my point of view
[02:19.50]If I could just forget about you
[02:24.50]To know you
[02:27.50]Is to love you
[02:31.50]You're everywhere I go
[02:35.50]And everybody knows
[02:40.50]I looked into your eyes
[02:42.50]And my world came tumbling down
[02:47.50]You're the devil in disguise
[02:50.50]That's why I'm singing this song to you
[02:55.50]To know you
[02:59.50]Is to love you
[03:02.50]You're everywhere I go
[03:06.50]And everybody knows
[03:12.50]I paid for you with my tears
[03:14.50]And swallowed my pride
