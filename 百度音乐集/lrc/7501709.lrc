[00:13.35]I've never known you
[00:15.54]But I'm no stranger to this feeling
[00:19.71]I I know it's over but the hurts not
[00:25.07]What do you call it?
[00:27.45]What do you call it when broken hearts are not done healing
[00:30.66]You threw down your cigarette but it's still hot
[00:35.87]Well I've learned to lie
[00:38.74]And here's what I've got
[00:40.97]
[00:41.44]Chorus:
[00:42.02]Well didn't I think you would always love me
[00:44.85]And didn't I want you to take care of me baby
[00:48.34]Well that ain't happenin'
[00:52.86]No no no
[00:53.89]Wouldn't I love just to rise above this
[00:56.95]You gotta believe
[00:59.52]I have suffered enough to be free
[01:01.17]So I'm officially leavin'
[01:02.60]With just a kiss on the cheek and
[01:04.36]I'm gone.

[01:19.66]It's never easy
[01:22.31]Breakin' this old addiction
[01:24.87]I I've got the reasons
[01:27.86]But no rational
[01:31.92]And I wanna hate you cause you don't give me no conviction
[01:36.78]Your betrayal oughta make this break down no trouble at all
[01:41.88]So let the rubble fall
[01:45.42]Cause I'm running off
[01:48.52]
[01:48.83]Chorus:

[02:03.22]You gotta believe
[02:04.84]I have suffered enough to be free
[02:07.51]So I'm officially leavin'
[02:09.16]With just a kiss on the cheek and
[02:10.69]I'm gone.

[02:41.33]I ain't got no second thoughts
[02:42.63]Because I know I'm on my way to the top
[02:45.73]On my way
[02:48.07]
[02:49.18]Chorus:
