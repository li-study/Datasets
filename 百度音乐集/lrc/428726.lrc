[00:03.50]What A Wonderful World
[00:05.50]Louis Armstrong
[00:07.50]
[00:08.50]I see trees of green, red roses too
[00:16.50]I see them bloom for me and you
[00:21.50]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[00:31.50]
[00:34.50]I see skies of blue and clouds of white
[00:42.50]The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
[00:49.50]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[01:02.50]The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
[01:08.50]Are also on the faces of people going by
[01:14.50]I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
[01:22.50]They're really saying I love you.
[01:28.50]I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
[01:36.50]They'll learn much more than I'll never know
[01:42.50]And I think to myself what a wonderful world
[01:53.50]Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
