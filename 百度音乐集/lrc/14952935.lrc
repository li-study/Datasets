[00:05.54]Can You Feel The Love Tonight
[00:09.99]Elton John
[00:12.99]
[00:16.58]There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
[00:24.50]When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
[00:32.75]An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
[00:40.63]It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
[00:48.30]And can you feel the love tonight
[00:57.20]It is where we are
[01:04.61]It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
[01:11.29]That we got this far
[01:18.59]And can you feel the love tonight
[01:27.31]How it's laid to rest
[01:35.01]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[01:41.60]Believe the very best
[01:46.36]
[02:04.47]There's a time for everyone if they only learn
[02:12.36]That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
[02:20.52]There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
[02:28.14]When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
[02:37.90]And can you feel the love tonight
[02:46.99]It is where we are
[02:54.17]It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
[03:00.96]That we got this far
[03:08.39]And can you feel the love tonight
[03:17.17]How it's laid to rest
[03:24.40]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[03:30.67]Believe the very best
[03:39.21]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[03:45.57]Believe the very best
