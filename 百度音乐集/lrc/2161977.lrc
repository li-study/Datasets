[00:01.73]Departure Bay 歌词
[00:03.28]
[00:11.10]the fadding scent of summertime
[00:15.61]arbutus trees and firs
[00:19.83]the glistening of rain-soaked moss
[00:23.13]going to the dairy queen at dusk
[00:28.17]down narrow roads
[00:32.90]in autumn light
[00:34.27]
[00:38.38]the salt air and the sawmills
[00:42.16]and the bars are full of songs and tears
[00:44.68]to the passing of the tugboats
[00:51.25]and people with their big ideas
[00:55.37]
[01:00.35]i just get home and then ileave again
[01:08.84]it's long ago and far away
[01:17.23]now we're skimming stones and
[01:21.99]exchanging rings
[01:27.52]and scattering and sailing from departure bay
[01:38.11]
[01:40.70]the house was bare of christmas lights
[01:45.16]it came down hard that year
[01:51.05]outside in our overcoats
[01:54.69]drinking down to the bitter end
[01:59.81]trying to make things right
[02:05.64]like my mother did
[02:10.41]
[02:11.34]last year we were laughing
[02:15.65]we sang in church so beautifully
[02:19.98]now her perfume's on the bathroom counter
[02:24.84]and i'm sitting in the back pew crying
[02:31.78]
[02:35.61]i just get home and then i leave again
[02:45.13]it's long ago and far away
[02:52.92]now we're skimming stones and
[02:58.35]exchanging rings
[03:02.79]and scattering and sailing from departure bay
[03:14.61]
[03:35.71]a song plays on the gramophone
[03:40.42]and thoughts turn back to life
[03:47.13]we took the long way to get back
[03:50.57]like driving over the malahat
[03:55.22]now a seaplane drones and time has flown
[04:04.95]
[04:06.49]i won't miss all the glamour
[04:10.86]while my heart is beating and the lilacs bloom
[04:14.30]but who knew when i started
[04:20.68]that i'd find a love and bring him home
[04:25.31]
[04:31.03]just get me there and one we will stay
[04:40.42]a long time off and far away
[04:49.22]now we're skimming stones and
[04:54.58]exchanging rings
[04:59.24]we're scattering and diving in departure bay
[05:12.08]
