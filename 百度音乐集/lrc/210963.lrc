[00:00.00]HQY制作
[00:00.01]献给可爱的哲
[00:14.40]I haven't felt you for a while
[00:20.74]I haven't had much opportunity to smile
[00:27.25]I see you in the eyes of couples passing by
[00:32.84]As soulmates kiss, the innocence,
[00:35.85]Too long I've been denied.
[00:38.00]
[00:38.28](chorus)
[00:39.08]Hey love, where you going
[00:45.02]Hey love, how you been
[00:51.65]I wish you'd stay a little longer
[00:58.64]No, that's ok, I understand
[01:01.86]Maybe another day
[01:05.39]Hey love, old friend,
[01:08.30]There you go again.
[01:15.21]
[01:25.78]I found a photo and you were there
[01:31.36]Captured in our faces
[01:33.86]Just before you disappeared
[01:38.08]It was nice to know you, if only for a while
[01:44.79]To come and go with a sweet hello
[01:47.84]And a bittersweet goodbye.

[01:50.45]
[01:50.51]Hey love, where you going
[01:56.98]Hey love, how you been
[02:03.19]I wish you'd stay a little longer
[02:10.48]No, that's ok, I understand
[02:13.53]Maybe another day
[02:17.18]Hey love, old friend,
[02:20.10]There you go again.
[02:26.77]
[02:28.45]I don't know where I am
[02:34.72]I don't know
[02:41.17]I don't know where I am
[02:47.96]
[02:49.03]And if every new beginning
[02:52.45]Is just another's end
[02:55.75]Tell me love, why should i begin
[03:02.05]Again.
[03:03.28]
[03:03.71](chorus)
[03:04.67]Hey love, where you going
[03:11.00]Hey love, how you been
[03:17.37]I wish you'd stay a little longer
[03:24.69]No, that's ok, I understand
[03:27.91]Maybe another day
[03:31.40]Hey love, old friend,
[03:34.46]There you go again.
[03:41.65]
[03:43.05]There you go again
[03:49.92]Can you come back?
[03:53.08]Can you come back love?
[03:56.23]Can you come back?
[03:59.36]Can you come back love?
