[00:15.69]Trying not to lose my head
[00:18.92]but I have never been this scared before
[00:22.28]Tell you what I'll do instead,
[00:25.76]lay my body down on the floor
[00:28.13]To forget what I've done,
[00:31.77]silhouette til the good lord come
[00:36.23]All we know is distance
[00:39.60]We're close and then we run
[00:43.16]Kiss away the difference
[00:46.63]I know you hate this one
[00:50.83]
[01:02.24]Trying not to lose your own,
[01:05.53]boxing up everything, you've got

[01:51.28]
[02:04.71]The violins make no sound
[02:11.33]And I begin to feel the ground
[02:18.66]All we know is distance
[02:22.68]We're close and then we run
[02:25.72]Kiss away the difference
[02:29.72]I know you hate this one
