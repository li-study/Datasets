[00:01.00]Art Brut - The Passenger
[00:06.00]
[00:17.55]I'm a determined passenger
[00:21.54]I never learnt to drive
[00:24.57]But don't worry, I'm not asking for a ride
[00:30.11]
[00:30.91]Some people hate the bus
[00:33.91]Not me, I can't get enough
[00:36.91]Some people live in the fast lane
[00:40.07]Not me, I take the train
[00:43.07]I love public transportation
[00:46.24]Train or bus, they're both amazing
[00:49.04]
[01:00.55]I don't take a book
[01:03.60]I've no time to read
[01:06.68]It's a long journey but there's a lot to see
[01:13.62]Back left window, upstairs
[01:16.67]The view alone is worth the fare
[01:19.68]If I wanna sleep
[01:21.38]Gonna miss my stop
[01:22.68]I use my phone as an alarm clock
[01:25.56]
[01:26.27]Some people hate the bus
[01:28.66]Not me, I can't get enough
[01:31.76]Some people live in the fast lane
[01:35.15]Not me, I take the train
[01:38.16]I love public transportation
[01:41.26]Train or bus, they're both amazing
[01:43.90]
[01:44.71]I know there's somewhere I'm supposed to be
[01:48.75]And I'm gonna get there eventually
[01:52.08]But when I'm travelling from A to B
[01:58.25]I'm avoiding my responsibility
[02:01.58]And I love the thrill of being last
[02:05.68]Bus and trains don't go that fast
[02:08.89]
[02:09.65]Some people hate the bus
[02:12.02]Not me, I can't get enough
[02:14.94]Some people live in the fast lane
[02:17.98]Not me, I take the train
[02:21.23]I love public transportation
