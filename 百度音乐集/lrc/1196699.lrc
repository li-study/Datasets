[00:08.92]She wakes up when I sleep
[00:13.36]To talk to ghosts like in the movies
[00:18.56]If you don't follow what I mean
[00:23.58]I sure don't mean to be confusing
[00:28.04]They say when she laughs
[00:29.44]She wants to cry
[00:30.79]She'll draw a crowd then try to hide
[00:33.23]Don't know if it's her
[00:34.45]Or just my mind I'm losing
[00:37.53]Nobody knows
[00:41.65]A wildflower still grows
[00:47.20]By the side of the road
[00:51.44]And she don't need to need like the roses
[00:58.16]Wildflower
[01:02.41]That girl's sure put a spell on me
[01:06.78]Yeah, her voodoos hidden right behind her pocket
[01:12.86]If she's fire, I'm gasoline
[01:17.06]Yeah, we fight a lot
[01:18.62]But neither wants to stop it
[01:22.13]Well, she'll tell you she's an only child
[01:24.94]Until you meet her brothers
[01:27.02]Swear she's never met the man
[01:29.52]She couldn't make into a lover
[01:32.11]Nobody knows
[01:35.92]A wildflower still grows
[01:41.39]By the side of the road
[01:45.68]And she don't need to need like the roses
[01:51.97]She's at home with the weeds
[01:56.64]And just as free as the night breeze
[02:01.85]She's got the cool of a shade tree
[02:05.65]She's growin' on me
[02:07.80]And I can't live with out her
[02:11.64]AI~
[02:14.50]Yesterday's a memory
[02:16.88]Tomorrow's accessory
[02:19.32]That's her favorite quote about regret
[02:24.27]Well, she'll tell you about her pedigree
[02:27.02]With a sailor's mouth
[02:28.27]He'd have left at sea
[02:33.72]And it ain't over yet
[02:43.42]Nobody, nobody knows?
[02:54.35]Nobody knows?
[02:58.57]A wildflower still grows
[03:03.89]By the side of the road
[03:08.25]And she don't need
[03:09.49]To need like the roses, the roses
[03:13.33]She feels at home with the weeds
[03:19.08]And just as free as the night breeze
[03:24.25]She's got the cool of a shade tree
[03:28.04]She's growin' on me
[03:30.26]And I can't live without her
[03:33.69]But, oh, nobody knows?
[03:40.39]Nobody knows?
[03:45.08]Nobody, nobody knows?
[03:50.68]Nobody knows?
[03:54.02]That's right?
[03:58.29]She wakes up when I sleep
[04:02.82]To talk to ghosts like in the movies
