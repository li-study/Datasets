[00:02.21]
[03:40.42][00:06.59]No I can't forget this evening
[03:45.28][00:11.31]Or your face as you were leaving
[03:49.45][00:15.34]But I guess that's just the way
[03:52.60][00:18.49]The story goes
[03:54.96][00:21.04]
[03:56.59][00:21.81]You always smile but in your eyes
[04:00.38][00:26.39]You sorrow shows
[04:04.15][00:30.76]Yes it shows
[04:08.98][00:34.72]
[00:38.72]No I can't forget tomorrow
[00:43.37]When I think of all my sorrow
[00:47.08]When I had you there
[00:49.55]But then I let you go
[00:53.25]
[00:54.29]And now it's only fair
[00:57.72]That I should let you know
[01:02.11]What you should know
[01:05.92]
[01:10.97]I can't live
[01:15.26]If living is without you
[01:19.06]I can't live
[01:23.09]I can't give anymore
[01:27.14]I can't live
[01:30.67]If living is without you
[01:35.30]I can't give
[01:38.67]I can't give anymore
[01:42.97]
[01:44.36]Well I can't forget this evening
[01:49.27]Or your face as you were leaving
[01:53.17]But I guess that's just the way
[01:56.78]The story goes
[01:59.20]
[02:00.22]You always smile but in your eyes
[02:04.40]You sorrow shows
[02:09.18]Yes it shows
[02:14.47]
[03:05.06][02:16.29]I can't live
[03:09.48][02:21.66]If living is without you
[03:13.24][02:25.47]I can't live
[03:16.70][02:28.95]I can't give anymore
[03:20.84][02:33.01]I can't live
[03:25.46][02:37.41]If living is without you
[02:41.25]I can't give
[03:33.89][02:44.96]I can't give anymore
[03:02.07][02:54.22]
