[02:39.89][02:29.84][02:19.85][01:30.09][00:45.35][00:00.96]This is the story of a girl
[02:42.35][02:22.19][01:32.58][00:47.80][00:04.16]Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
[02:44.31][01:34.83][00:50.28][00:05.70]And while she looked so sad in photographs
[02:47.68][01:38.63][00:53.72][00:08.46]I absolutely love her when she smiles
[00:17.77]How many days in the year she woke up with hope
[00:21.05]But she only found tears
[00:23.64]Making the promises never for real
[00:23.88]Actin' so insincere
[00:26.26]As long as she stands there waiting
[00:28.77]Wearing the holes in soles of her shoes
[00:31.29]How many days disapear
[00:33.51]You look in the mirror so how do you choose
[01:22.08][00:36.34]Your clothes never wear as well the next day
[02:14.33][01:23.37][00:39.09]And your hair never falls out quite the same way
[02:15.78][00:41.16]You never seem to run out of things to say
[03:07.64][03:02.97][02:29.33][02:18.43][01:39.97][01:28.20][01:21.21][00:55.26][00:43.96]
[00:55.72]How many lovers would stay
[01:03.02]Just to put up with this shit day after day
[01:05.97]How do we wind up this way
[01:08.59]Watchin' the mouths for the words I would say
[01:10.98]As long as we stand here waiting
[01:13.44]Wearing the clothes of the soles I would chose
[01:15.74]How do we get there today
[01:18.32]If we're walkin' to far from the price of the shoes
[01:25.84]You never run out of things to say
[02:10.62]And your clothes never wear as well the next day
[02:25.08]And while she looks so sad in photographs
[02:28.24]I absolutely love her
[02:32.17]Who's pretty face she hid from the world
[02:37.98][02:34.62]And while she looked so sad and lonely there
[02:54.96]when she smiles
