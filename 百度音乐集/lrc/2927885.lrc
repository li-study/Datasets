[00:01.78]I'm really close tonight
[00:07.06]And I feel like I'm moving inside her
[00:11.05]Lying in the dark
[00:14.86]I think that I'm beginning to know her
[00:19.43]Let it go
[00:22.38]I'll be there when you call
[00:26.36]Whenever I fall at your feet
[00:34.64]And you let your tears rain down on me
[00:42.53]Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[00:50.73]You're hiding from me now
[00:54.23]There's something in the way that you're talking
[00:58.26]The words don't sound right
[01:02.17]But I hear them all moving inside you
[01:06.30]Go, I'll be waiting when you call
[01:11.80]Whenever I fall at your feet
[01:19.78]And you let your tears rain down on me
[01:27.67]Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[01:35.40]The finger of blame has turned upon itself
[01:39.35]And I'm more than willing to offer myself
[01:43.29]Do you want my presence or need my help
[01:47.20]Who knows where that might lead
[01:51.74]I fall at your feet
[01:59.31]The finger of blame has turned upon itself
[02:02.74]And I'm more than willing to offer myself
[02:06.67]Do you want my presence or need my help
[02:10.43]Who knows where that might lead
[02:14.83]I fall at your feet
