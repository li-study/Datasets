[00:22.45]
[00:23.02]Verse 1: Eminem
[00:23.93]I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
[00:26.78]She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
[00:29.60]Plus she got a sugar daddy
[00:31.29]Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
[00:34.51]If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
[00:37.16]You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
[00:40.45]When you step away son, she got her face done
[00:43.23]Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
[00:45.88]You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
[00:48.28]If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
[00:51.29]But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
[00:54.26]To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
[00:57.10]Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
[00:59.94]While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)
[01:01.88]
[01:02.55]Verse 2: Denaun Porter
[01:02.95]Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
[01:05.20]To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
[01:09.85]You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
[01:13.29]You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down
[01:16.42]And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
[01:21.63]Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
[01:24.35]You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
[01:27.14]When you got niggas hiding in your closet
[01:29.90]I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
[01:32.06]
[01:32.61]Verse 3: 3
[01:34.13]I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
[01:36.94]So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
[01:39.51]And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
[01:42.22]Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
[01:45.21]I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
[01:47.76]Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
[01:52.06]Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
[01:53.74]And said "Oh it's like that?"
[01:55.81]She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
[01:58.13]She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
[02:00.71]She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
[02:03.97]She asked could I give her mine two
[02:07.19]Got to the crib and called her up
[02:08.87]We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
[02:12.73]I said "Maxine check this out,
[02:15.22]Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
[02:19.21]Got to the crib she let me in
[02:20.98]She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
[02:24.76]I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
[02:27.40]What the fuck are you doing?
[02:30.37]So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
[02:33.83]As she went for my midsection
[02:35.80]I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
[02:38.17]Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
[02:41.37]Before I hit it she said
[02:42.50]"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
[02:46.30]I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
[02:49.10]She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
[02:51.63]I got up out
[02:52.52]
[02:52.95]Denaun:Hey, Maxine
[02:56.76]Maxine:What
[02:57.93]Denaun:You thinking about sucking my dick?
[02:59.06]Maxine:Yeah for a small price
[03:01.18]Denaun:For a small price? What you mean?
[03:04.02]Maxine:You know, money nigga
[03:07.30]Denaun:You don't need no damn money,
[03:09.03]I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
[03:12.09]Maxine:(laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
[03:16.14]Denaun:AIDS
[03:17.55]Maxine:(laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
[03:19.46]Denaun:My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
[03:21.70]Maxine:Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
[03:24.95]Denaun:Oh for real, it's like that?
[03:26.66]Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
[03:27.97]so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
[03:31.89]I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
[03:34.74]Denaun:Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
[03:36.81]Maxine:No, see..
[03:37.63]Denaun:You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
[03:39.72]Maxine:Hold on, why it ain't even like that
