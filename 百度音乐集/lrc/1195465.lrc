[00:19]Johnny take a walk
[00:21]With your sister the moon
[00:23]Let her pale light in
[00:26]To fill up the room
[00:28]You've been living underground
[00:31]Eating from a can
[00:33]You've been running away
[00:35]From what you don't understand
[00:38]Love
[00:40]She's slippy
[00:42]You're sliding down
[00:44]She'll be there
[00:45]If you hit the ground
[00:48][00:58][01:43][01:53][02:03][02:58][03:07][03:17][03:27][03:36]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[01:14]Johnny take a dive
[01:16]With your sister in the rain
[01:18]Let her talk about the things
[01:21]You can't explain
[01:23]To touch is to heal
[01:26]To hurt is to steal
[01:28]If you want to kiss the sky
[01:30]Better learn how to kneel
[01:32]On your knees boy
[01:35]She's the wave
[01:37]She turns the tide
[01:38]She sees the man inside the child
[02:07][03:41]Lift my days ... light up my nights
[02:39]One day you'll look back
[02:42]And you'll see
[02:44]Where you were held
[02:46]How by this love
[02:48]While
[02:49]You could stand
[02:51]There
[02:52]You couldn't move on this moment
[02:54]Follow this feeling
[03:22]We move through miracle days
[03:26]She moves with it
[03:31]Spirit moves in mysterious ways
[03:39]She moves with it
