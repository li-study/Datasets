[00:05.58]Lifehouse
[00:08.54]
[00:11.34]Standing on top of the edge it feels like it's going down
[00:16.91]Everything stays in my mind feeling in a daze on the ground
[00:22.35]Feels like it's gonna give life's to hard to live anymore
[00:27.79]I think I've had enough things too tough
[00:30.49]I'm out the door
[02:15.21][01:28.51][00:33.24]All in all it's just another day now

[02:18.98][01:32.40][00:37.18]What you gonna do
[02:20.49][01:33.88][00:38.67]Standing on top of the world tonight
[02:23.39][01:36.95][00:41.67]No ones looking back at you
[02:26.75][01:40.16][00:44.85]Stand tall

[00:56.92]
[01:06.53]Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on
[01:11.88]Salt & tears in the minds in the mouths of a bad decision
[01:17.76]Too late for another mistake it's bringing me down
[01:22.89]With all your faults it isn't your fault
[01:25.46]what's going on
[01:53.57]So you lost yourself
[01:59.55]So you lost your way
[02:04.95]Found life through someone else
[02:10.25]But you threw it all away
[02:39.83]Times rolling on
[02:41.50]rolling on today
[02:45.33]It's going on
[02:47.00]Going on today
