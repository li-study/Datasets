[03:35.42][03:15.59][03:09.48][03:02.14][02:56.29][02:48.90][02:07.65][01:39.97][01:29.08][01:08.78][00:33.09][00:22.67][00:00.10]
[00:08.57]So I find a reason to shave my legs
[00:13.51]Each single morning
[00:15.21]So I count on someone on Friday nights
[00:17.30]To take me dancing again
[00:19.93]To church on Sundays
[00:23.46]To plant more trees
[00:26.46]And someday think of kids
[00:29.65]Or maybe just save a little money
[03:06.32][03:02.86][02:52.97][02:49.62][02:35.81][02:22.48][01:54.36][01:40.41][00:48.18][00:33.50]You’re the one I need
[02:28.28][01:46.83][00:39.75]The way back home is always long
[02:31.69][01:50.19][00:43.26]But if you’re close to me I’m holding on
[02:41.64][02:00.11][00:53.55]My real life has just begun
[02:44.62][02:03.17][00:56.80]Cause there’s nothing like your smile made of sun
[01:01.86]In the world full of strangers
[01:05.00]You’re the one I know
[01:15.33]So I learned to cook and finally lose
[01:19.87]My kitchen phobia
[01:21.89]And so I got the arms to cuddle in
[01:23.62]When there’s a ghost or a news
[01:26.82]That brings insomnia
[01:30.45]To buy more thongs
[01:33.39]To write more happy songs
[01:36.85]It always takes a little help from someone
[02:58.77]Youre my real life has just begun
[03:11.96]Nothing like your smile made of sun
[03:27.22][03:19.57][03:16.28]Nothing like your love
