[00:10.03]
[00:12.76]Slow down, Lie down,
[00:17.87]Remember it's just you and me.
[00:24.44]Don't sell out, bow out,
[00:29.66]Remember how this used to be.
[00:32.27]
[00:34.77]I just want you closer,
[00:37.85]Is that alright?
[00:40.93]Baby let's get closer tonight
[00:45.72]
[00:46.02](chorus:)
[00:47.35]Grant my last request,
[00:50.20]And just let me hold you.
[00:52.43]Don't shrug your shoulders,
[00:56.24]Lay down beside me.
[00:59.24]Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere,
[01:03.45]But one last time just go there,
[01:08.01]Lay down beside me
[01:11.34]
[01:11.94]Oh, I've found, that I'm bound
[01:16.84]To wander down that one way road.
[01:22.15]And I realise all about your lies
[01:28.82]But I'm no wiser than the fool I was before.
[01:33.69]
[01:34.44]I just want you closer,
[01:38.00]Is that alright?
[01:40.30]Baby let's get closer tonight
[01:46.21]
[02:11.65]Oh, baby, baby, baby,
[02:16.64]Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?
[02:21.46]
[02:40.65]Yeah, lay down beside me.
[03:20.17]One last time let's go there,
[03:20.73]Lay down beside me
[03:21.80]
