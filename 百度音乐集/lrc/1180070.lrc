[00:21.50]Some say love it is a river
[00:30.22]That drowns the tender reed
[00:38.16]Some say love it is a razor
[00:46.96]That leaves your soul to bleed
[00:54.81]Some say love it is a hunger
[01:03.68]And endless aching need
[01:11.96]I say love it is a flower
[01:21.40]And you its only seed
[01:32.07]
[01:33.70]It's the heart afraid of breakin'
[01:42.04]That never learns to dance
[01:49.42]It's the dream afraid of wakin'
[01:57.73]That never takes the chance
[02:05.21]It's the one who won't be taken
[02:13.40]Who cannot seem to give
[02:20.99]And the soul afraid of dyin'
[02:29.98]That never learns to live
[02:42.92]
[03:19.03]When the night has been too lonely
[03:26.40]And the road has been too long
[03:33.73]And you think that love is only
[03:41.08]For the lucky and the strong
[03:48.49]Just remember in the winter
[03:55.98]Far beneath the bitter snows
[04:04.33]Lies the seed that with the sun's love
[04:12.85]In the spring becomes the rose
[04:25.56]
