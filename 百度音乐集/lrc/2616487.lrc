[00:00.50]Bob Dylan - On the Road Again
[00:04.63]
[00:11.26]On the road again
[00:13.26]Just can't wait to get on the road again
[00:17.26]The life I love is makin' music with my friends
[00:21.26]And I can't wait to get on the road again
[00:26.26]On the road again
[00:28.26]Goin' places that I've never been
[00:32.26]Seein' things that I may never see again,
[00:37.26]And I can't wait to get on the road again.
[00:41.26]On the road again
[00:43.26]Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
[00:47.26]We're the best of friends
[00:49.26]insisting that the world be turnin' our way
[00:53.26]And our way
[00:56.26]Is on the road again
[00:58.26]Just can't wait to get on the road again
[01:00.26]The life I love is makin' music with my friends
[01:06.26]And I can't wait to get on the road again
[01:42.26]On the road again
[01:44.26]Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
[01:47.26]We're the best of friends
[01:49.26]Insisting that the world be turnin' our way
[01:54.26]And our way
[01:56.26]Is on the road again
[01:59.26]Just can't wait to get on the road again
[02:04.26]The life I love is makin' music with my friends
[02:08.26]And I can't wait to get on the road again
[02:12.26]And I can't wait to get on the road again
