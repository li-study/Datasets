[00:20.18]I said I wouldn't cry
[00:24.87]The day you say goodbye
[00:29.40]It's not like I'll never see you again
[00:37.74]I guess the things you need
[00:42.00]You just can't get from me
[00:46.86]But you still can reach out to me now and then
[00:55.45]
[00:55.46]My head is spinning round
[00:59.93]All my defenses down
[01:03.70]I have held the world in my hands
[01:07.52]But I can't keep you from slipping away
[01:21.44]
[01:21.45]If time will show me grace
[01:26.22]And you to a better place
[01:30.30]Then I can live knowing it wasn't in vain
[01:36.82]It hurts so much to know when love means letting go
[01:47.38]And no one can tell me that they've felt my pain
[01:56.58]
[01:56.59]No strength can stop you now
[02:01.04]Will someone show me how
[02:04.92]How to live it over again
[02:08.78]'cause I can't keep you from slipping away
[02:17.23]
[02:17.24]I will never break your power over me
[02:25.97]I could never shake the thought of you burning in my mind
[02:34.24]You're all I see
[02:53.57]
[02:53.58]My head is spinning round
[02:58.15]All my defenses down
[03:02.11]I have held the world in my hands
[03:05.90]But I can't keep you from slipping away
[03:14.56]
[03:14.57]Oh, I can't keep you from slipping away
[03:38.11]Oh, Slipping away
