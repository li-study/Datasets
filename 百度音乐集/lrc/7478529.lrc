[02:08.02]
[02:30.11]Just when I felt like giving up on us
[02:33.26]You turned around and gave me one last touch
[02:36.18]That made everything feel better
[02:38.59]And even then my eyes got wetter
[02:41.45]Sometimes feel I wanna ask you if you love me
[02:43.99]But I don't wanna feel so weak
[02:47.03]Maybe ive been California dreaming
