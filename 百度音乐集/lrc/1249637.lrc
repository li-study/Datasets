[00:11.95]Just when it's getting good
[00:14.18]I slowly start to freeze
[00:17.74]Just when it's feeling real
[00:19.84]I put my heart to sleep
[00:23.25]It's the memory I can see
[00:26.08]Then this fear comes over me
[00:28.85]Understand that I don't mean
[00:31.75]To push you away from me
[00:34.75]Why am I so afraid
[00:37.91]To crash down and lose my heart again
[00:40.66]I don't know, I can't see
[00:43.36]What's come over me
[00:46.26]Why am I so afraid
[00:49.48]To break down and lose my mind again
[00:52.21]I don't know, I can't see
[00:54.85]What's come over me
[01:00.66]You got a way
[01:03.22]Of easing me out of myself
[01:06.39]I can't stay but I can't leave
[01:09.27]I am my worst enemy
[01:12.21]Please understand
[01:14.77]That its not you it's what I do
[01:17.91]Just when I'm about to run
[01:20.73]I realize what I've become
[01:23.70]Why am I so afraid
[01:26.70]To crash down and lose my heart again
[01:29.64]I don't know, I can't see
[01:32.29]What's come over me
[01:35.10]Why am I so afraid
[01:38.18]To break down and lose my mind again
[01:41.10]I don't know, I can't see
[01:43.78]What's come over me
[01:47.17]What's come over me
[01:52.75]What's come over me
[01:58.49]Now I wonder what you think of me
[02:01.43]Don't kow why I break so easily
[02:04.24]All my fears are armed surrounding me
[02:06.80]I can't get no sleep
[02:10.03]I keep runnin in circles around you
[02:12.89]Are you the trap I wanna fall into, heah...
[02:21.19]Why am I so afraid
[02:24.22]To crash down and lose my heart again
[02:27.15]I don't know, I can't see
[02:29.81]What's come over me
[02:32.64]Why am I so afraid
[02:35.77]To break down and lose my mind again
[02:38.65]I don't know, I can't see
[02:41.37]What's come over me
[02:44.39]Why am I so afraid
[02:47.33]To crash down and lose my heart again
[02:50.20]I don't know, I can't see
[02:52.88]What's come over me
[02:55.78]Why am I so afraid
[02:58.84]To break down and lose my mind again
[03:01.82]I don't know, I can't see
