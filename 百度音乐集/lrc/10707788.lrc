[00:17]Once I was a boogie singer
[00:22]Playin' in a Rock 'n Roll band
[00:26]I never had no problems
[00:31]Runnin' down the one night stands
[00:34]And everything around me
[00:40]Got to start to feelin' so low
[00:44]And I decided quickly
[00:48]To disco down and check out the show
[00:52]Yea they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
[00:57]And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
[01:02]Play that funky music white boy
[01:06]Play that funky music right
[01:10]Play that funky music white boy
[01:15]Lay down and the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
[01:45]Now first it wasn't easy
[01:50]Changin' rock 'n roll at Myze
[01:54]And things were gettin' shaky
[01:58]I thought I'd have to leave it behind
[02:02]But now it's so much better
[02:07]I'm funking out in every way
[02:11]But I'll never lose that feeling
[02:16]Of how I learned my lesson that day
[02:20]When they were singin' and dancin' and movin' to the groovin'
[02:25]And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
[02:29]Play that funky music white boy
[02:33]Play that funky music right
[02:38]Play that funky music white boy
[02:42]Lay down and the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
