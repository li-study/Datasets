[00:04.41]My girl's got a big mouth
[00:07.32]With which she blabbers a lot
[00:11.32]She laughs at most everything
[00:14.43]Whether it's funny or not
[00:18.06]And if you see her
[00:21.48]Tell her it's over now
[00:25.83]I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
[00:37.77]When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
[00:39.55]When I'm away she never leaves the house
[00:46.34]I want a girl who laughs for no one else
[00:56.82]My girl's got eyeballs
[01:00.03]In the back of her head
[01:03.19]She looks around and around
[01:06.60]You know it makes me sad to see her like that
[01:10.13]Please don't believe her - she says that for anyone
[01:17.54]And if you see her
[01:20.39]Tell her it's a hey hey hey hey
[01:24.51]I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
