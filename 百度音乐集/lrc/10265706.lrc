[00:01.58]She is a diamond, I am a stone
[00:09.00]I come from nowhere, she\'s been to Rome
[00:16.25]Her daddy’s a lawyer, mines not around
[00:23.57]She has good manners, I\'m rough all around
[00:28.96]
[00:30.45]Well, you can come from something, you can come from nothing
[00:34.14]You can be princess, you can be a working man
[00:38.16]But in the end...
[00:40.04]
[00:40.91]We all want something else
[00:45.03]We all want something we can\'t have
[00:48.26]We all want something else
[00:51.90]We all want something strange to us
[00:55.06]Maybe a roll in the dirt or it\'s a seat in first class
[00:59.22]We all want something we can’t have
[01:02.69]
[01:03.58]She wants to go to reastraunts in Beverly Hills where people stare
[01:06.76]But I don\'t care, it\'s just what she grew up around
[01:10.56]She drags me to parties where people ask me where I went to college
[01:14.05]She knows damn well I barely finished school
[01:17.88]She knows a lot about yearly salaries and trust funds and dividends
[01:21.40]She knows that I don\'t really care at all
[01:25.76]But we got together and it\'s working ok
[01:31.27]
[01:32.70]You can come from something, you can come from nothing

[01:54.16]We all want something strange to us
[01:57.36]Maybe a roll in the dirt or it\'s a seat in first class
[02:01.57]We all want something we can’t have
[02:05.08]
[02:06.58]Well, you can spend your whole life looking for something
[02:10.61]Something that might be
[02:13.27]Right in front of your eyes
[02:14.85]But you\'ll be looking for something else, you\'ll never find
[02:19.72]
