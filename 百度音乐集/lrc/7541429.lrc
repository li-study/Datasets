[00:02.00]Ra Ra Riot - Winter '05
[00:08.00]
[00:20.01]Orange lamps shine by willow bay
[00:24.02]Ice covers from the lake to where I lay
[00:29.44]In a state
[00:32.24]In which I dream
[00:35.03]If you were here
[00:37.28]Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
[00:42.00]And if you were here
[00:47.03]Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone
[00:51.89]
[01:00.00]But instead I sit atop the crest
[01:05.10]Looking down on the valley where the dead rest
[01:11.08]And every morning I wake beside myself
[01:15.62]
[01:18.71]But I digress
[01:21.26]If you were here
[01:23.38]Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
[01:30.66]And if you were here
[01:33.04]Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone
[01:37.99]
[01:55.51]If you were here
[01:59.67]Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
[02:05.59]And if you were here
[02:09.27]Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone
[02:14.28]
[02:15.31]If you were here
[02:18.86]Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
[02:26.49]And if you were here
[02:28.56]Then i'd have a choice to live not be alone
[02:34.33]
