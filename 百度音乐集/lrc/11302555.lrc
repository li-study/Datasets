[00:03.16]
[00:13.48]Light up with me my dear,
[00:19.64]Light up.
[00:31.95]Under stormy night, tell nobody.
[00:46.75]
[00:58.12]My brother where do you intend to go tonight?
[01:02.44]I heard that you missed your connecting flight,
[01:07.66]to the blue ridge mountains, over near Tennessee.
[01:13.42]
[01:17.74]You're ever welcome with me any time you like,
[01:22.03]Let's drive to the country side,
[01:24.82]leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes,
[01:29.18]So no one gets worried, no.
[01:36.50]So no one gets worried, no.
[01:43.17]
[01:46.44]But Sean don't get callous,
[01:51.22]I'm sure it'll be fine.
[01:55.98]I love you, I love you,
[02:00.75]Oh brother of mine.
[02:07.45]
[02:23.05]In the quivering forest,
[02:27.90]Where the shivering dog rests,
[02:32.77]I will do it grandfather,
[02:37.66]Wilt to wood and end.
[02:42.55]And the river got frozen,
[02:47.58]And the hole got snowed in,
[02:52.38]And near the moon glow ride,
[02:57.26]Till the morning light.
[03:01.90]
[03:02.82]Terrible am I child?
[03:07.69]Even if you don't mind,
[03:12.05]In the quivering forest,
[03:16.85]Where the shivering dog rests,
[03:21.77]I will do it grandfather,
[03:26.70]Wilt to wood and end.
[03:31.63]And the river got frozen,
[03:36.45]And the hole got snowed in,
[03:41.31]And near the moon glow ride,
[03:46.25]Till the morning light.
[03:50.55]
[03:51.80]Terrible am I child?
[03:56.77]Even if you don't mind, No.
