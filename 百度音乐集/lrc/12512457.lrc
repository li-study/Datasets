[00:27.65]It's been so long
[00:31.02]Since I've seen her face
[00:36.09]You say she's doin' fine
[00:42.86]I still recall
[00:46.69]A sad cafe
[00:50.06]How it hurt so bad to see her cry
[00:57.73]I didn't want to say good-bye

[01:37.91]I'm on the road again
[01:44.29]She needed so much more
[01:48.34]Than I could give
[01:52.10]We knew our love could not pretend
[01:59.57]Broken hearts can always mend.
[02:06.83]Send her my love, memories remain
[02:12.54]Send her my love, roses never fade
[02:22.13]Send her my love
[02:25.12]Callin' out her name I'm dreamin'
[02:28.83]Reflections of a face I'm seein'
[02:32.63]It's her voice
[02:34.04]That keeps on haunting me
[02:40.52]Guitar solo...
[03:08.97]Send her, send her my love
