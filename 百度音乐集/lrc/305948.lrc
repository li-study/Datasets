[00:00.00]私人生活
[00:05.75]唱：简 迷离（Gemini）
[00:13.81]不知这是在哪里
[00:30.44]笑容有一些生硬
[00:33.37]被谁拍走了表情
[00:36.38]留下问题
[00:39.31]这温度让我安静
[00:42.21]灯的光让我伤心
[00:45.32]烟的灰落了一地
[00:48.18]夜幕降临
[00:50.69]everything is cold
[00:52.67]don’t you feel so
[00:53.85]all the sound from out
[00:55.15]don’t you turn off
[00:57.00]you can just try
[00:59.61]live your personal life
[01:02.58]这是谁的华丽的躯客
[01:05.55]谁在让我陌生的微笑着
[01:09.01]you have to try
[01:11.51]work out another plan
[01:14.46]给我一个密封的铁盒
[01:17.33]来装我的一段私人生活
[01:21.62]我听到你的呼吸
[01:24.37]正穿过我的身体
[01:27.17]见过你梦的美丽
[01:30.05]不忍叫醒
[01:33.13]多久没有在一起
[01:36.39]分享彼此的秘密
[01:39.09]转过身去让眼睛
[01:42.35]流出泪滴
[01:44.72]baby stay with me
[01:46.25]even in dreams
[01:47.74]colors blur your skin
[01:49.24]like a painting
[01:50.99]some time we must
[01:53.81]live our personal life
[01:56.81]这是一个奇怪的时刻
[01:59.48]你在身边我却那么寂寞
[02:02.30]you know who can
[02:05.32]find out another plan
[02:08.65]其他什么精彩的段落
[02:12.39]都比不过一句简单承诺
[02:14.97]baby time is out
[02:16.07]whose turn is on
[02:17.45]nightmare was too strong
[02:18.82]when did you come
[02:20.40]you say life goes on
[02:21.91]dream should be off
[02:23.46]but what you have done
[02:25.15]looks like all wrong
[02:26.52]you can just try
[02:35.40]live your personal life
[02:38.62]这是谁的华丽的躯客
[02:41.61]谁在让我陌生的微笑着
[02:44.76]you have to try
[02:47.52]work out another plan
[02:50.56]给我一个密封的铁盒
[02:53.57]来装我的一段私人生活
[02:57.35]some time we must
[02:59.69]live our personal life
[03:02.67]you know who can
[03:08.55]some time we must

[03:14.81]you know who can
