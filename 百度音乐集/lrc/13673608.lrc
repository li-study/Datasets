[00:00.10]演唱：Bill Withers
[00:00.20]作词：李正江
[00:00.30]作曲：李正江
[00:01.50]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[00:06.00]It's not warm when she's away
[00:13.00]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[00:17.00]And she's always gone too long
[00:20.00]Anytime she goes away
[00:26.00]Wonder this time where she's gone
[00:32.00]Wonder if she's gone to stay
[00:38.00]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[00:42.00]And this house just ain't no home
[00:45.00]Anytime she goes away
[00:50.00]And I know, I know...
[01:08.00]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:15.00]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:21.00]Only darkness everyday
[01:27.00]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:30.00]And this house just ain't no home
[01:33.00]Anytime she goes away
[01:39.00]Anytime she goes away
[01:45.00]Anytime she goes away
[01:51.00]Anytime she goes away
[01:57.00]The End
