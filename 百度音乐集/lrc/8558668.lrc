[00:15.97]Searching for the right
[00:17.70]But it keeps avoiding me
[00:21.06]Sorrow in my soul
[00:22.55]cause it seems that wrong
[00:24.29]really loves my company
[00:26.48]
[00:27.52]Hes more than a man

[01:33.97]A kiss up on my cheek
[01:35.69]He's here reluctantly
[01:37.51]as if I'm gonna be out late
[01:40.75]I say I won't be long
[01:42.45]Just hanging with the girls
[01:44.16]A liar didn't have to tell
