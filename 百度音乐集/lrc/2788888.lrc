[00:15.90]Thirty-nine candles burnt out on a cake
[00:20.85]Each representin’ a million mistakes
[00:26.04]The last one still burns, there’s a wish I can make
[00:31.25]This time I’m getting’ it right
[00:36.35]So I close my eyes and I take a deep breath
[00:40.76]And I promise myself in the time I have left
[00:46.02]
[00:46.36]I’m gonna work like I don’t need the money
[00:51.28]I’m gonna laugh like I’m not afraid to cry
[00:56.44]I’m gonna dance like nobody’s watchin’
[01:01.18]I’m gonna love while I still got the time
[01:06.73]
[01:13.90]Lovin’ me hasn’t been easy on you
[01:18.91]I don’t know why, but I know you still do
[01:23.86]It may be my day, but here’s a present for you
[01:29.11]You’re lookin’ at your new man
[01:34.11]He’s sincere and sober and faithful and kind
[01:38.68]And he’s home when you need him and girl startin’ tonight
[01:43.96]

[01:49.10]I’m gonna laugh like I’m not afraid to cry
[01:54.30]I’m gonna dance like nobody’s watchin’
[01:59.17]I’m gonna love while I still got the time
[02:04.87]
[02:13.00]No more excuses and no more me doing things wrong
[02:23.05]Life is too short, baby, I’ve wasted ours for too long
[02:30.75]And baby from now on
[02:32.81]
[02:33.20]I’m gonna work like I don’t need the money
[02:37.95]I’m gonna laugh like I’m not afraid to cry
[02:43.18]I’m gonna dance like nobody’s watchin’
[02:48.00]I’m gonna love while I still got the time
[02:53.14]
[02:53.53]I’m gonna work like I don’t need the money I know I am
[02:58.61]I’m gonna laugh like I’m not afraid to cry laugh laugh laugh
[03:04.22]I’m gonna dance like nobody’s watchin’ I’m gonna dance I’m gonna dance
