[00:00.82]《Love Will Tear Us Apart》
[00:10.21]
[00:41.46]When the routine bites hard
[00:46.10]and ambitions are low
[00:50.14]And the resentment rides high
[00:52.80]but emotions won\'t grow
[00:56.00]And we\'re changing our ways
[00:59.84]taking different roads
[01:03.59]Then love, love will tear us apart again
[01:23.68]Why is the bedroom so cold
[01:28.31]Turned away on your side?
[01:32.00]Is my timing that flawed
[01:35.37]our respect run so dry?
[01:39.18]Yet there\'s still this appeal
[01:42.11]That we\'ve kept through our lives
[01:46.04]Love, love will tear us apart again
[02:01.29]
[02:28.08]Do you cry out in your sleep
[02:30.89]All my failings expose?
[02:35.00]Get a taste in my mouth
[02:37.93]As desperation takes hold
[02:41.28]Is it something so good
[02:46.34]Just can\'t function no more?
[02:50.52]When love, love will tear us apart again
[03:21.10]
[04:15.96]Do you cry out in your sleep
[04:19.67]All my failings expose?
[04:23.20]Get a taste in my mouth
[04:27.47]As desperation takes hold
[04:30.66]Is it something so good
[04:33.97]Just can\'t function no more?
[04:37.90]When love, love will tear us apart again
[05:08.53]
