[00:03.92][00:07.94][04:15.00][04:51.05]
[00:08.82]I have walked
[00:10.98]All alone
[00:13.12]On these streets
[00:15.35]I call home
[00:17.49]Streets of hope
[00:19.75]Streets of fear
[00:22.04]Through the sidewalk cracks
[00:26.12]Time disappears
[00:30.99]I was lost
[00:33.11]On my knees
[00:35.32]Only if
[00:37.60]Hugged the field
[00:39.80]As I chocked
[00:41.94]Back to tears
[00:44.21]There's a silent scream
[00:48.28]No one could hear
[00:51.49][02:04.67]So far away
[00:55.41]From everything
[00:57.98]You know it's true
[01:00.41]Something inside
[01:04.46]That makes you do
[01:06.44]What you got to do
[01:08.68][02:21.86][03:15.12][03:55.00]Ring the bells
[01:10.88][02:24.02][03:19.44][03:57.23]Ring them loud
[01:12.98][02:26.16][03:23.86][03:59.47]Let them ring
[01:15.21][02:28.44][03:26.19][04:01.66]Here and now
[01:17.54][02:30.70][03:28.32][04:03.81]Just reach out
[01:20.04][01:37.81][02:32.99][02:51.07][03:30.95][03:48.69][04:06.43]And ring the bells of freedom
[01:26.35][02:39.50][03:37.20]When your world's
[01:28.51]Crashing down
[01:30.68][02:43.99][03:41.68]Like you've lost every round
[01:35.18][02:48.31][03:46.05]Stand the ground
[01:44.16]Up the steps of the church
[01:48.47]Through the fields in the dirt
[01:53.03]In the dark
[01:55.18]I have seen
[01:57.42]That the sun still shines
[02:01.26]For the one who believe
[02:08.86]So full of doubt
[02:11.04]You needed proof
[02:13.63]Just close your eyes
[02:17.70]And hear the sound inside of you
[02:41.26][03:38.90]Come crashing down
[03:35.61]Yeah!
[04:15.38]
