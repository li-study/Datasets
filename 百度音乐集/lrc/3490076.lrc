[00:13.00]
[00:24.61]Feeling like an outcast of society, a man meets an alien,
[00:25.47]who shows him that his destiny is not to live on Earth,
[00:26.58]but to accomplish great things on another planet.
[00:36.25]
[00:37.65]The future is nowhere
[00:52.56]It comes to you like a divine star
[01:08.98]
[01:23.19]One night when nightmares invaded my head
[01:26.98]He appeared to me from the sky
[01:30.03]Floated in the air, it dazzled my eyes
[01:33.54]And he carried me for a flight
[01:36.26]
[01:36.59]too tired to understand
[01:39.30]I crossed the galaxy
[01:42.64]Universe of fire I saw
[01:47.58]Showed me so many ways
[01:51.64]Then I felt lost in time
[01:54.67]I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine
[02:00.16]
[02:00.91]By a fantasy I have found my destiny
[02:07.49]Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
[02:14.45]Exists another destiny
[02:19.79]A world where is growing all love
[02:25.11]
[02:40.97]IN his machine lights surrounded me
[02:45.41]Flashed on my face so bright
[02:48.30]Left behind me my memories and griefs
[02:51.81]Run away after the past
[02:53.82]
[02:54.38]So tired to understand
[02:57.43]I crossed the galaxy
[03:00.39]Universe of fire I saw
[03:04.92]Showed me so many ways
[03:09.68]Then I felt lost in time
[03:12.97]I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine
[03:17.53]
[03:19.06]By a fantasy I have found my destiny
[03:24.86]Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
[03:32.43]Exists another destiny
[03:37.85]A world where is growing all love
[03:49.63]
[05:41.78]By a fantasy I have found my destiny
[05:47.56]Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
[05:54.84]Exists another destiny
[06:00.02]A world where is growing all love
[06:05.88]By a fantasy I have found my destiny
[06:12.88]A world where is growing all love
