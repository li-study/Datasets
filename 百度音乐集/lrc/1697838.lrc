[00:07.57]Mariah Carey --  Alone In Love
[00:17.71]
[00:21.25]Swept me away
[00:23.39]But now I'm lost in the dark
[00:28.24]Set me on fire
[00:30.71]But now I'm left with a spark
[00:34.66]Alone, you got beyond the haze
[00:38.68]and I'm lost inside the maze
[00:42.47]I guess I'm all alone in love
[00:46.87]
[00:50.52]I look into your eyes
[00:54.15]You turn the other way
[00:57.66]And now I realize
[01:01.20]It's all a game you play
[01:04.62]I hold you in the night
[01:08.09]And wake to find you gone
[01:11.54]You're running out of sight
[01:14.96]It's so hard holding on
[01:18.70]All alone in love
[01:21.93]
[01:23.95]Swept me away
[01:26.14]But now I'm lost in the dark
[01:30.86]Set me on fire
[01:32.95]But now I'm left with a spark
[01:37.36]Alone, you got beyond the haze
[01:41.30]and I'm lost inside the maze
[01:44.78]I guess I'm all alone in love
[01:51.74]
[01:52.91]You haunt me in my dreams
[01:56.65]I'm calling out your name
[02:00.01]I watch you fade away
[02:03.48]Your love is not the same
[02:07.18]I've figured out your style
[02:10.52]To quickly drift apart
[02:14.10]You held me for a while
[02:17.69]Planned it from the start
[02:21.41]All alone in love
[02:24.78]
[02:27.73]Sitting in the dark without you
[02:30.03]How am I supposed to make it
[02:33.41]Through the night
[02:40.42]Slowly fall apart without you
[02:44.36]Cry away the hours
[02:46.46]Till the morning light
[02:52.66]
[02:54.86]Swept me away
[02:56.58]But now I'm lost in the dark
[03:01.39]Set me on fire
[03:03.56]But now I'm left with a spark
[03:07.88]Alone, you got beyond the haze
[03:11.82]and I'm lost inside the maze
[03:15.32]I guess I'm all alone in love
[03:23.21]
[03:24.18]I guess I'm all alone in love
[03:29.26]I guess I'm all alone in love
[03:35.31]I guess I'm all alone in love
[03:43.86]Yeah,all alone in love
