[00:01.00]Jonas Brothers - Before The Storm (Feat Miley Cyrus)
[00:02.00]
[00:19.45]I know this isn't what I wanted,
[00:25.54]I never thought it come this far,
[00:32.78]Just thinking back to where we started,
[00:39.17]And how we lost all that we are.
[00:43.00]
[00:45.79]We were young and times were easy.
[00:52.13]But I could see it's not the same.
[00:58.48]I'm standing here but you don't see me,
[01:04.90]I'd give it all for that to change.
[01:10.98]But I don't want to lose her,
[01:16.94]Don't wanna let her go.
[01:21.14]
[01:23.78]Standin' out in the rain,
[01:28.07]Need to know if it's over,
[01:32.20]'Cuz I will leave you alone.
[01:35.37]
[01:37.04]I'm flooded with all this pain,
[01:40.84]Knowing I'll never hold her
[01:44.28]
[01:45.06]Like I did
[01:46.58]Before the storm
[01:51.92](Yeah, before the storm)
[01:56.82]
[02:03.18]With every strike of lightning,
[02:06.18]
[02:08.82]Comes a memory that lasts.
[02:12.62]
[02:15.21]And not a word is left unspoken,
[02:21.60]As the thunder starts to crash.
[02:25.36]
[02:27.39]Maybe I
[02:30.16]Should give up.
[02:32.31]
[02:35.14]Standin' out in the rain,
[02:38.44]Need to know if it's over,
[02:42.40]'Cuz I will leave you alone.
[02:46.18]
[02:48.00]I'm flooded with all this pain,
[02:51.25]Knowing I'll never hold her
[02:54.82]
[02:55.43]Like I did
[02:57.46]Before the storm
[03:00.34]
[03:00.50]Trying to keep
[03:02.25]The lights from going out
[03:05.54]
[03:06.37]And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
[03:12.89]They always say,
[03:15.02]That a heart is not a home
[03:18.20]Without the one who gets you through the storm.
[03:27.28]
[03:29.72]Standin' out in the rain,
[03:32.88]Knowin' that it's really over.
[03:36.86]Please don't leave me alone.
[03:40.73]
[03:42.11]I'm flooded with all this pain,
[03:45.62]Knowing I'll never hold ya,
[03:49.53]Like I did,
[03:51.73]Before the storm.
[03:59.56](The storm)
[04:01.80]
[04:09.26]Like I did
[04:11.08]Before the storm.
