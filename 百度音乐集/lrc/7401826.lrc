[00:00.00]Sweetbox-Everytime
[00:05.00]
[00:22.59]Sometimes I question you and me
[00:27.19]The reasons I'm here get hard to see
[00:31.76]But when I feel your fingertips brush mine
[00:36.36]I swear I see heaven for a moment in time
[00:40.94]Been running and hiding
[00:44.89]So scared of love
[00:50.70]But everytime you look into my eyes
[00:56.88]And everytime you kiss my lips good night
[01:01.49]The honesty's too much
[01:03.88]It's in the way we touch
[01:06.21]It gets me everytime
[01:11.23]Anytime you look at me that way
[01:15.13]There's so much said when there's nothing to say
[01:20.10]The sweetest thing I've heard
[01:22.30]without a single word It gets me everytime
[01:29.59]It gets me everytime
[01:36.76]Sometimes I wake up next to you
[01:41.63]And I wonder if you knew
[01:45.37]That you would change my life with just one kiss
[01:49.97]That you would be the one I'd fall in love with
[01:54.51]I've been running and hiding
[01:59.01]So scared of love
[02:04.46]But everytime you look into my eyes
[02:10.51]And everytime you kiss my lips good night
[02:15.07]The honesty's too much
[02:17.45]It's in the way we touch
[02:19.73]It gets me everytime
[02:24.44]Anytime you look at me that way
[02:28.75]There's so much said when there's nothing to say
[02:33.54]The sweetest thing I've heard
[02:35.85]without a single word It gets me everytime
[02:40.71]It gets me everytime
[02:53.68]
[03:15.60]But everytime you look into my eyes
[03:20.72]And everytime you kiss my lips good night
[03:25.20]The honesty's too much
[03:27.60]It's in the way we touch
[03:29.82]It gets me everytime
[03:34.63]It gets me everytime
[03:42.44](End)
