[00:01.11]Right Here Waiting
[00:03.90]演唱：阿杜
[00:05.88]
[00:31.20]Oceans apart day after day
[00:36.15]And I slowly go insane
[00:41.62]I hear your voice on the line
[00:47.05]But it doesn't stop the pain
[00:52.59]If I see you next to never
[00:57.20]How can we say forever
[01:02.91]Wherever you go
[01:05.70]Whatever you do
[01:07.95]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:13.57]Whatever it takes
[01:16.36]Or how my heart breaks
[01:18.82]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:24.12]
[01:30.29]I took for granted all the times
[01:35.62]That I thought would last somehow
[01:40.77]I hear the laughter I taste the tears
[01:46.21]But I can't get near you now
[01:51.78]Oh can't you see it baby
[01:56.89]You've got me going crazy
[02:01.97]Wherever you go
[02:04.85]Whatever you do
[02:07.13]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:12.23]
[02:13.00]Whatever it takes
[02:15.58]Or how my heart breaks
[02:17.91]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:24.55]I wonder how we can survive
[02:29.66]this romance
[02:31.64]
[02:35.09]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:39.48]I'll take the chance
[02:43.95]
[03:07.45]Oh can't you see it baby
[03:11.94]You've got me going crazy
[03:17.37]Wherever you go
[03:20.29]Whatever you do
[03:22.55]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:28.09]Whatever it takes
[03:30.74]Or how my heart breaks
[03:33.29]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:38.63]
[03:47.77]waiting for you
