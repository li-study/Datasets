[00:02.55]Lenka
[00:04.32]
[00:08.28]Roll, roll with the punches
[00:12.43]Roll, roll with the punches
[00:15.88]That really hurt me
[00:17.84]Like a fist to the face I wasn't ready
[00:21.90]To be knocked out of place
[00:24.32]Suddenly everything I was sure of
[00:26.45]Sinking below the depths of the surface
[00:29.83]
[00:31.77]It's unexpected, it usually is
[00:35.77]When you're rejected, or you take a hit
[00:40.21]Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
[00:42.39]No time to grow a thicker skin
[00:44.51]What kind of situation am I in now?
[00:47.45]
[00:48.10]When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
[00:51.92]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[00:56.44]If all life offers is black and blue
[00:59.89]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[01:04.72]
[01:11.70]Little weapons over the phone
[01:15.76]They like to threaten the life that I know
[01:19.82]They say get over here and get into the ring
[01:22.40]But I'm not really much a fighter
[01:25.58]
[01:27.69]My mechanisms of defense are down
[01:31.85]And my resistance is out on the town
[01:36.21]I was alarmed by your attack
[01:38.42]This isn't a boxing match
[01:39.93]But I'll be damned if I ever let you win
[01:43.42]
[01:44.02]When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
[01:47.87]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[01:52.32]If all life offers is black and blue
[01:55.81]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[02:01.48]
[02:02.52]When all I want is a little stability
[02:09.79]Some time without any bruises
[02:16.87]You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
[02:20.38]Putting your fist into my ears
[02:22.42]Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving you all in pieces
[02:26.39]Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
[02:28.39]No time to grow a thicker skin
[02:30.53]What kind of situation am I in now?
[02:33.34]
[02:33.96]Oh when life tries to knock all the wind out of you
[02:37.83]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[02:42.32]If all life offers is black and blue
[02:45.90]You've got to hold, hold, hold your head up high
[02:50.33]When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
[02:53.78]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[02:58.30]If all life offers is black and blue
[03:01.87]You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
[03:06.69]
