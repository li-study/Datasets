[00:29.48]I got a little black book with my poems in.
[00:34.14]Got a bag, got a toothbrush and a comb.
[00:39.70]When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone.
[00:47.64]I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on.
[00:52.36]Got those swollen hands blus.
[00:57.49]Got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from.
[01:04.86]I got electric light,
[01:08.16]And I got second sight.
[01:14.88]Got amazing powers of observation.
[01:25.55]And that is how I know,
[01:28.81]When I try to get through,
[01:33.00]On the telephone to you,
[01:39.35]There'll be nobody home.
[01:45.74]I got the obligatory Hendrix perm,
[01:55.95]And the inevitable pinhole burns,
[02:01.40]All down the front of my favorite satin shirt,
[02:07.54]I got nicotine stains on my fingers.
[02:14.28]I got a silver spoon on a chain.
[02:17.86]Got a grand piano to prop my mortal remains.
[02:26.07]I've got wild, staring eyes.
[02:32.35]And I got a strong urge to fly.
[02:37.01]But I got nowhere to fly to… fly to… fly to… fly to.
[02:50.67]Ooooo Babe,
[02:57.02]When I pick up the phone,
[03:03.65]There's still nobody home.
[03:08.54]I got a pair of Gohill boots,
[03:17.81]And I got fading roots.
