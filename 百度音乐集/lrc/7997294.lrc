[00:36.33]Think Of Me
[00:38.29]From "The Phantom Of The Opera"
[00:40.36]
[00:59.08]Think of me,
[01:05.03]think of me fondly,
[01:07.20]when we've said goodbye.
[01:11.00]Remember me, once in a while -
[01:15.01]please promise me you'll try.
[01:18.46]
[01:19.50]When you find that,
[01:21.47]once again,
[01:22.58]you long to take your heart back and be free -
[01:27.15]if you ever find a moment,
[01:31.97]spare a thought for me...
[01:39.48]
[01:52.93]We've never said our love was evergreen,
[01:56.58]or as unchanging as the sea -
[02:01.07]but if you can still remember,
[02:06.32]stop and think of me...
[02:10.63]
[02:11.73]Think of all the things we've shared and seen -
[02:18.87]don't think about the things which might have been...
[02:27.73]
[02:28.37]Think of me,
[02:30.86]think of me waking,
[02:32.66]silent and resigned.
[02:36.59]Imagine me,
[02:38.71]trying too hard to put you from my mind.
[02:44.57]Recall those days,
[02:46.49]look back on all those times,
[02:48.48]think of the things we'll never do -
[02:51.79]there will never be a day,
[02:56.25]when I won't think of you...
[03:04.59]
[03:08.94]Can it be?
[03:11.04]Can it be Christine?
[03:12.96]Bravo!
[03:15.71]What a change!
[03:18.16]You're really not a bit the gawkish girl that once you were...
[03:24.25]She may not remember me,
[03:28.09]but I remember her...
[03:33.42]We've never said our love was evergreen,
[03:36.64]or as unchanging as the sea -
[03:40.90]but please promise me,
[03:43.83]that sometimes,
[03:47.01]you will think oooooo~f me!
