[00:20.00]Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
[00:34.00]and feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at cloud that way.
[00:47.00]But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.
[00:59.00]So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.
[01:12.00]I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
[01:19.00]from up and down, and still somehow
[01:25.00]it's cloud illusions I recall.
[01:31.00]I really don't know clouds at all.
[01:47.00]Moons and Junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
[01:58.00]as every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
[02:11.00]But now it's just another show. You leave 'em laughing when you go
[02:23.00]and if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.
[02:36.00]I've looked at love from both sides now,
[02:41.00]from give and take, and still somehow
[02:48.00]it's love's illusions I recall.
[03:03.00][02:56.00]I really don't know love at all.
[03:17.00]Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud,
[03:29.00]dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.
[03:41.00]But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say
[03:51.00]I've changed.
[03:56.00]Something's lost but something's gained in living every day.
[04:06.00]I've looked at life from both sides now,
[04:13.00]from win and lose, and still somehow
[04:50.00][04:19.00]it's life's illusions I recall.
[05:08.00][05:00.00][04:26.00]I really don't know life at all.
