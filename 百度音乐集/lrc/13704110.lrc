[00:20.55]Another night slowly closes in
[00:24.65]and I feel so lonely
[00:30.36]Touching heat freezing on my skin I pretend you still hold me
[00:40.04]I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
[00:45.07]I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
[00:51.92]I can't believe you're gone
[00:57.29]You were the first, you'll be the last
[01:01.55]
[01:03.12]Wherever you go I'll be with you
[01:12.62]Whatever you want I'll give it to you
[01:22.93]Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
[01:30.57]Remember after the fire after all the rain
[01:36.74]I will be the flame
[01:43.99]I will be the flame
[01:56.60]
[01:57.09]Watching shadows move across the wall
[02:01.46]feels so fright'ning
[02:06.83]I wanna run to you, I wanna call,
[02:10.57]but I've been hit by lightning
[02:16.76]Just can't stand up for falling apart
[02:21.75]Can't see through this veil across my heart
[02:25.22]over you
[02:28.36]You'll always be the one
[02:33.89]You were the first, you'll be the last
[02:38.40]
[02:39.14]Wherever you go I'll be with you
[02:49.59]Whatever you want I'll give it to you
[02:59.47]Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
[03:07.51]Remember after the fire after all the rain
[03:13.07]I will be the flame
[03:20.48]I will be the flame
[03:38.19]
[03:42.96]I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
[03:48.17]I'm in way too deep over you
[03:54.83]You'll always be the one
[04:00.48]You were the first, you'll be the last
[04:04.56]
[04:06.14]Wherever you go I'll be with you
[04:15.92]Whatever you want I'll give it to you
[04:25.53]Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
[04:33.85]Remember after the fire after all the rain
[04:39.65]I will be the flame
[04:44.82]I will be the flame
