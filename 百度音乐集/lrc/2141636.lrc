[00:06.00]我们相爱一年了，OH，YEAH
[00:16.19]Something\'s causing feet to fly,
[00:17.85]rising like a dark knight
[00:19.94]in silence
[00:23.87]traffic\'s slow with broken boats
[00:25.91]heading for the sea
[00:26.99]and I\'m an island
[00:28.82]
[00:31.51]I watched you disappear into the clouds
[00:35.23]swept away into another town
[00:38.58]谢谢你一直等着我，我一定会会好的努力为我们的未来奋斗
[00:46.79]the world carries on without you
[00:54.25]but nothing remains the same
[01:02.82]I\'ll be lost without you
[01:10.04]until the last of days
[01:15.70]豆豆要天天开心哦
[01:26.15]the sun is in the east,
[01:27.48]rising for the beasts
[01:29.33]and the beauties
[01:33.15]if only I could tear it down,
[01:35.78]plant it in the ground to warm your face
[01:39.33]
[01:41.01]I built myself a castle on the beach
[01:44.88]watching as it slid into the sea
[01:48.16]爱你是一件很重大的事情
[01:56.43]the world carries on without you
[02:04.06]but nothing remains the same
[02:07.95]I\'ll be lost without you
[02:12.73]until the last of days
[02:28.01]until the last of days
[02:33.07]
[02:54.84]through wars and harvest moons
[03:02.63]I will wait for you.
[03:01.04]
[03:19.99]the world carries on without you
[03:27.44]but nothing remains the same
[03:35.42]I\'ll be lost without you
[03:42.85]until the last of days
[03:50.58]until the last of days
