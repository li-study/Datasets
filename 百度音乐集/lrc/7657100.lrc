[00:35.88]Nicholas:
[00:36.65]It doesn't make any sense
[00:40.93]This tragic ending
[00:45.65]In spite of the evidence
[00:48.89]There's something still missing
[00:53.51]
[00:54.47]Heard some of the rumor's told
[00:58.70]A taste of ones wealth
[01:03.15]Did victoria wound his soul?
[01:06.77]Did she bid him farewell?
[01:10.19]
[01:10.49]Victoria:
[01:10.73]One last time
[01:14.54]We'll lay down today
[01:19.05]One last time
[01:23.50]Until we fade away
[01:27.96]One last time
[01:32.43]We'll lay down today
[01:36.84]One last time
[01:41.34]We slowly fade away
[01:52.72]
[02:19.00]Nicholas:
[02:19.56]Here I am inside his home
[02:23.79]It holds the many clues
[02:25.39]To my suspicions
[02:27.94]And as Im standing here right now
[02:31.84]I'm finally shown what I have always known
[02:36.74]
[02:36.99]Coincidence I can't believe
[02:39.83]As my childhood dreams slowly come true
[02:44.87]
[02:48.66]Are these her memories
[02:53.51]Awakened through my eyes
[02:58.11]This house has brought back to life
[03:04.61]
[03:06.65]An open door
[03:08.46]I walk on through
[03:10.67]Into his bedroom
[03:12.95]
[03:13.84]Feeling as cold as outside
[03:17.05]The walls disappear
[03:19.26]To some woman who's screaming
[03:21.17]A man pleads forgiveness
[03:23.45]His words I can not hear
[03:31.94]
