[00:10.14]I rememeber way back way back when
[00:14.75]I said i never wanna see your face again
[00:19.09]Cause you were loving yes you were loving somebody else
[00:24.29]And i knew oh yes i knew i couldnt control myself
[00:29.44]And now they bring you back into my life again
[00:33.97]And so i put on a face just like your friends
[00:38.52]But i think you know oh yes you know whats going on
[00:43.52]Cause the feelings in me oh yes in me are burning strong
[00:47.87]
[00:48.58]But I will never be your stepping stone
[00:53.62]Take it all or leave me alone
[00:58.56]I will never be your stepping stone
[01:03.02]Im standing upright on my own
[01:07.43]
[01:08.63]You used call me up from time to time
[01:12.82]And it would be so hard for me not to cross the line
[01:17.94]The words of love lay on my lips just like a curse
[01:22.75]And i knew oh yes i knew they'd only make it worse
[01:28.25]And now you have the nerve to play along
[01:32.62]Just like the mistro beats in your song
[01:37.40]You get your kicks you get your kicks from playing me
[01:42.27]And the less you give the more i want so foolishly
[01:46.85]
[01:47.32]But i will never be your stepping stone
[01:52.39]Take it all or leave me alone
[01:57.28]I will never be your stepping stone
[02:01.91]Im standing upright on my own...
[02:14.33]
[02:25.86]No i will never be your stepping stone
[02:31.25]Take it all or leave me alone
[02:36.17]I will never be your stepping stone
[02:41.16]Im standing upright on my own
[02:46.16]
[02:46.72]Never be your stepping stone
[02:50.83]Take it all or leave me alone
