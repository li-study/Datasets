[00:05.51]
[00:10.45]I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
[00:14.22]Only you can make it right
[00:20.32]If I can't be with you holding you tight
[00:24.07]There won't be no morning light
[00:28.15]
[00:29.36]Everywhere I turn
[00:32.01]I see your face
[00:35.09]Reminding me of a higher place
[00:39.06]Every time you smile, Angels cry
[00:44.11]Every time you walk on by
[00:46.11]
[00:46.57]CHORUS:
[00:48.19]I'm not the only
[00:50.96]Feeling' lonely
[00:53.51]Every time you walk on by
[00:57.87]I try to say something'
[01:00.20]But end up with nothing'
[01:03.25]Every time you walk on by
[01:12.81]
[01:18.02]I keep my cool
[01:19.83]I pretend I'm not in
[01:21.63]Every time you come too near
[01:27.78]I'm such a fool cause
[01:29.85]This love is true
[01:31.98]And if I don't tell you
[01:34.56]Someone else surely will
[01:35.82]
[01:36.90]Everywhere I turn
[01:39.11]I see your face
[01:42.38]Reminding me of a higher place
[01:46.69]Every time you smile, Angels cry
[01:51.34]Every time you walk on by
[01:53.99]
[01:55.48]I'm not the only
[01:58.21]Feeling' lonely
[02:01.22]Every time you walk on by
[02:05.14]I try to say something'
[02:07.41]But end up with nothing'
[02:10.64]Every time you walk on by
[02:14.73]
[02:29.05]If I ever see you again
[02:30.76]This craziness must find an end
[02:34.19]I look at you and I promise myself
[02:36.85]
[02:37.30]I'm not the only
[02:44.90]Feeling' lonely
[02:47.40]Every time you walk on by
[02:51.77]I try to say something'
[02:54.32]But end up with nothing'
[02:57.28]Every time you walk on by
[03:00.48]
[03:01.73]I'm not the only
[03:04.00]Feeling' lonely
[03:06.96]Every time you walk on by
[03:11.40]I try to say something'
[03:13.67]But end up with nothing'
[03:16.85]Every time you walk on by
[03:21.20]
[03:26.49]Every time you walk on by
[03:36.38]
