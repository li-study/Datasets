[00:00.80]Charlotte Martin - Wild Horses
[00:01.60]
[00:02.23]Childhood living
[00:08.82]Is easy to do
[00:15.60]The things that you wanted
[00:23.34]Well I bought them for you
[00:26.69]
[00:31.64]Graceless lady
[00:38.17]You know who I am
[00:45.51]You know I can't let you
[00:52.80]Just slide through my hands
[00:57.41]
[01:00.90]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[01:15.54]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[01:26.47]
[01:30.87]I watched you suffer
[01:37.45]A dull aching pain
[01:44.38]And now you've decided
[01:51.92]To show me the same
[01:56.12]
[01:59.21]No sweeping exits
[02:06.29]Or offstage lines
[02:13.53]Could make me feel bitter
[02:21.23]Or treat you unkind
[02:28.52]
[02:29.12]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[02:43.75]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[02:54.94]
[02:59.40]I know I've dreamt you
[03:06.68]A sin and a lie
[03:13.77]And I have my freedom
[03:21.05]But I don't have much time
[03:25.16]
[03:29.01]Fate has been suffered
[03:35.94]And tears must be cried
[03:42.97]So let's do some living
[03:51.23]After we die
[03:58.97]
[03:59.23]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[04:15.93]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[04:32.12]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[04:47.01]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
