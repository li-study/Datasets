[00:16]Sometimes I feel
[00:18]Like I am drunk behind the wheel
[00:21]The wheel of possibility
[00:24]However it may roll
[00:28]Give it a spin
[00:30]See if you can somehow factor in
[00:33]You know there's always more than one way
[00:36]To say exactly what you mean to say
[00:40]Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
[00:43]How could I have ever been so blind?
[00:46]I was waiting for an indication
[00:49]It was hard to find
[00:52]Don't matter what I say only what I do
[00:56]I never mean to do bad things to you
[00:58]So quiet but I finally woke up
[01:01]If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
[01:20]Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
[01:23]How could I have ever been so blind?
[01:26]I was waiting for an indication
[01:29]It was hard to find
[01:32]Don't matter what I say only what I do
[01:35]I never mean to do bad things to you
[01:38]So quiet but I finally woke up
[01:41]If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
[01:50]Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
[01:54]How could I have ever been so blind?
[01:56]I was waiting for an indication
[01:59]It was hard to find
[02:02]Don't matter what I say only what I do
[02:06]I never mean to do bad things to you
[02:09]So quiet but I finally woke up
[02:11]If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too
