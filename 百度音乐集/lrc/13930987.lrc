[00:17.72]I got your emails
[00:19.57]You just don't get females
[00:21.63]Now do you?
[00:25.72]What's in my heart
[00:27.58]Is not in your head anyway
[00:31.34]
[00:33.75]Mate, you're too late
[00:35.32]And you weren't worth the wait
[00:37.60]Now were you?
[00:41.56]It's out of my hands since
[00:43.31]You blew your last chance
[00:45.59]When you played me
[00:48.38]
[00:48.74]You'll have to cry me out
[00:52.84]You'll have to cry me out
[00:57.30]The tears that'll fall mean nothing at all
[01:01.57]It's time to get over yourself
[01:04.48]
[01:04.79]Baby, you ain't all that
[01:08.87]Baby, there's no way back
[01:13.72]You can keep talking
[01:15.33]But baby, I'm walking away
[01:20.80]
[01:21.69]When I found out
[01:22.90]How you messed me about
[01:25.56]I was broken
[01:28.10]
[01:29.55]Back then I believed you
[01:31.44]Now I don't need you no more
[01:35.75]
[01:37.65]The pic on your phone
[01:39.63]Proved you weren't alone
[01:41.43]She was with you
[01:45.53]Now I couldn't care
[01:47.50]'Bout who, what or where
[01:49.46]We're through
[01:51.98]

[01:57.09]You'll have to cry me out
[02:01.62]The tears that'll fall mean nothing at all
