[00:02.00]Life Is Cool
[00:05.55]Sweetbox 
[00:08.55]
[00:12.80]I never really tried to be positive
[00:15.59]I'm too damn busy being negative
[00:18.44]So focused on what I get
[00:20.44]I never understand what it means to live
[00:24.00]You know we all love to just complain
[00:26.70]But maybe we should try to rearrange
[00:29.55]There's always someone who's got it worse than you
[00:33.76]My life is?My life is so cool, my life is so cool
[00:40.84]Oh yeah, from a different point of view
[00:45.34]My life is...
[00:46.13]My life is so cool, my life is so cool
[00:52.01]Oh yeah, from a different point of view

[01:03.13]We're all so busy trying to get ahead
[01:05.64]Got a pillow of fears when we go to bed
[01:08.58]We're never satisfied
[01:10.64]The grass is greener on the other side
[01:14.19]So distracted with our jealousy
[01:16.99]Forget it's in our hands to stop the agony
[01:19.75]Will you ever be content on your side of the fence?
[01:24.14]My life is?My life is so cool, my life is so cool
[01:31.06]Oh yeah, from a different point of view
[01:35.29]My life is?My life is so cool, my life is so cool
[01:42.16]Oh yeah, from a different point of view
[01:47.71]
[01:59.12]Maybe you're the guy who needs a second chance
[02:01.74]Maybe you're the girl who's never asked to dance
[02:04.56]Maybe you're a lonely soul
[02:06.56]A single mother scared and all alone
[02:10.06]Gotta remember we live what we choose
[02:12.79]It's not what you say, it's what you do
[02:15.69]And the life you want is the life you have to make
[02:19.84]My life is
[02:21.20]My life is so cool, my life is so cool
[02:26.74]Oh yeah, from a different point of view
[02:31.54]My life is so cool, my life is so cool
