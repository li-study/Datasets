[00:14.94]
[00:16.94]Judging by the look on the organ-grinder,
[00:19.94]He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit.
[00:22.93]It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder.
[00:25.68]He's waiting for the day when he gets me,
[00:28.18]But I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string.
[00:34.24]I just need this stage to be seen.
[00:40.19]We all need a pantomime to remind us what is real.
[00:46.09]Hold my eye and know what it means.
[00:50.50]

[01:26.35]It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder.
[01:29.45]He's waiting for the day when he gets me,
[01:31.67]But I won't be your concubine
[01:34.86]I'm a puppet not a whore.
[01:37.69]I just need this stage to be seen.
[01:43.60]Will you be a friend of mine to remind me what is real?
[01:49.54]Hold my heart and see that it bleeds.
