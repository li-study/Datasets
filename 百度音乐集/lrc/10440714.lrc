[00:06.86]The beast in me
[00:12.20]Is caged by frail and fragile bars
[00:19.62]Restless by day
[00:22.44]And by night rants and rages at the stars
[00:30.50]God help the beast in me
[00:36.28]
[00:40.68]The beast in me
[00:45.97]Has had to learn to live with pain
[00:53.56]And how to shelter from the rain
[01:01.03]And in the twinkling of an eye
[01:05.63]Might have to be restrained
[01:11.79]God help the beast in me
[01:17.78]
[01:23.24]Sometimes it tries to kid me
[01:28.21]That it's just a teddy bear
[01:32.23]And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
[01:39.46]And that is when I must beware
[01:45.93]Of the beast in me that everybody knows
[01:59.23]They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
[02:04.20]Patently unclear
[02:09.10]If it's New York or New Year
[02:17.24]God help the beast in me
[02:23.24]
[02:27.40]The beast in me
