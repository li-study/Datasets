[00:22.99]There's a song that's inside of my soul
[00:31.87]It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again.
[00:40.89]I'm awaken in the infinite cold
[00:48.50]But you sing to me over and over and over again
[00:56.96]So I lay my head back down
[01:05.77]And I lift my hands and pray
[01:12.50]To be only yours
[01:14.88]I pray
[01:16.61]To be only yours
[01:19.09]I know now
[01:20.84]You're my only hope
[01:33.05]Sing to me the song of the stars
[01:40.79]Of the galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
[01:49.63]When it feels like my dreams are so far
[01:58.31]Sing to me all the plans that you have for me over again.
[02:06.91]And I lay my head back down
[02:15.69]And I lift my hands and pray
[02:22.21]To be only yours
[02:24.57]I pray
[02:26.45]To be only yours
[02:28.98]I know now
[02:30.66]You're my only hope
[02:52.08]I give you my destiny
[02:56.11]I'm giving you all of me
[03:00.57]I want your symphony
[03:03.94]Singing in all that I am
[03:07.79]At the top of my lungs
[03:12.29]I'm giving Him all I have
[03:16.92]And I lay my head back down
[03:25.35]And I lift my hands and pray
[03:31.86]To be only yours
[03:34.31]I pray
[03:36.36]To be only yours
[03:38.61]I pray
[03:40.58]To be only yours
[03:43.17]I know now
[03:44.89]You're my only hope
