[00:00.00]WHERE OR WHEN
[00:03.50]Written By Richard Rodgers / Lorenz Hart
[00:06.50]
[00:08.98]It seems we stood and talked like this, before
[00:16.20]We looked at each other in the same way then
[00:20.70]But I can't remember where or when
[00:29.19]The clothes you're wearing are the close, you wore
[00:36.35]The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
[00:40.82]But I can't remember where or when
[01:44.78][00:48.79]Some things that happened for the first time
[01:53.59][00:57.40]Seem to be happening again
[02:01.39][01:05.35]And so it seems that we have met before
[02:08.33][01:12.38]And that we laughed before, also loved before
[02:16.46][01:20.43]But who knows where or when
[02:24.96][01:26.55]
