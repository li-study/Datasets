[00:38.00]Zephyr in the sky at night - I wonder
[00:43.00]Do my tears of mourning
[00:47.00]Sink beneath the sun
[00:53.00]She's got herself a universe -Gone quickly
[00:58.00]For the call of thunder
[01:02.00]Threatens everyone
[01:07.00]And I feel
[01:09.00]Like I just got home

[01:16.00]Like I just got home
[01:18.00]And I feel
[01:23.00]
[01:31.00]Faster than the speeding light - She's flying
[01:36.00]Trying to remember
[01:40.00]Where it all began
[01:46.00]She's got herself a little piece of heaven
[01:51.00]Waiting for the time when
[01:55.00]Earth shall be as one
[02:00.00]And I feel
[02:02.00]Like I just got home
[02:04.00]And I feel

[02:09.00]Like I just got home
[02:11.00]And I feel
[02:16.00]
[02:24.00]Quicker than a ray of light
[02:27.00]Quicker than a ray of light
[02:31.00]Quicker than a ray of light
[02:39.00]
[02:54.00]Zephyr in the sky at night - I wonder
