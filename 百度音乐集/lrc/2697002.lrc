[00:-2.00]The Old 97's - Dance With Me
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:06.60]Underneath the foreign stars
[00:09.33]In a foreign place where they don't love you
[00:12.50]I do care,
[00:13.93]In the pale moonlight
[00:15.45]Your eyes are wide
[00:16.83]And the band plays…
[00:18.15]Everybody wants you
[00:19.67]
[00:24.67]And he takes your hand tenderly
[00:27.65]And he whispers
[00:28.87]Sweet surrender, nothing
[00:31.02]How he feels about girls like you
[00:33.83]Your flip flop smiles,
[00:35.72]And your big blue eyes
[00:37.03]On vacation
[00:38.17]
[00:38.43]Dance with me into the ocean
[00:41.25]Roll with me into the sea
[00:44.57]Don't tell me the world is in trouble
[00:47.44]Do you want to dance with me?
[00:52.93]
[00:58.38]Go, changes hands as the big waves
[01:01.59]Crash and dream don't die
[01:03.44]But I do
[01:04.76]Where were you when I needed you
[01:07.16]Right now
[01:07.94]The telephone just rings,
[01:09.36]I'm gonna find you…
[01:10.72]
[01:10.96]Dance with me, into the ocean
[01:13.74]Roll with me, into the sea
[01:17.00]Don't tell me the world is in trouble
[01:19.93]Do you want to dance with me, oh
[01:25.89]do you want to dance with me?
[01:31.62]
[01:42.02]Underneath the foreign sun
[01:44.58]With a foreign man who is gone and almost forgotten
[01:48.82]Take everything you see
[01:50.70]And remember us and wonder,
[01:52.72]If you will be forgiven…
[01:54.95]
[01:55.24]Dance with me, into the ocean
[01:58.05]Roll with me, into the sea
[02:01.32]Don't tell me the world is in trouble
[02:04.16]Don't tell me the world is in trouble
[02:07.25]
[02:07.56]Dance with me, into the ocean
[02:10.41]Roll with me, into the sea
[02:13.68]Don't tell me the world is in trouble
[02:16.49]Do you want to dance with me
[02:22.98]Do you want to dance with me, oh
[02:29.20]Do you want to dance with me?
[02:34.54]
[02:34.89]Kevin Boul & Larry Cheng, share with you!
