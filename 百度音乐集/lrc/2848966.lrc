[00:04.26]
[00:07.21]A blossom fell from off a tree
[00:13.91]It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
[00:20.78]The gypsies say and I know why
[00:27.69]""A falling blossom only touches lips that lie""
[00:33.07]
[00:35.26]A blossom fell and very soon
[00:41.85]I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon
[00:48.62]I thought you loved me, you said you loved me
[00:55.86]We planned together to dream forever
[01:02.83]The dream has ended, for true love died
[01:10.02]The night a blossom fell and touched two lips that lied

[02:07.08]We planned together to dream forever
[02:13.83]The dream has ended, for true love died
