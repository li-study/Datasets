[00:28.50][00:18.50]
[00:29.50]My mother came to hazard when I was just seven
[00:34.50]Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
[00:41.50]That boy's not right
[00:45.50]Three years ago when I came to know Mary
[00:49.50]First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
[00:56.50]And saw the man inside
[01:00.50]We used to walk down by the river
[01:08.50]She loved to watch the sun go down
[01:15.50]We used to walk along the river
[01:23.50]And dream our way out of this town
[01:30.50]
[01:47.50]No one understood what I felt for Mary
[01:51.50]No one cared until the night she went out walking alone
[01:58.50]And never came home
[02:02.50]Man with a badge came knocking next morning
[02:06.50]Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
[02:13.50]Pointed right at me
[02:16.50]
[02:17.50]I swear I left her by the river
[02:24.50]I swear I left her safe and sound
[02:32.50]I need to make it to the river
[02:40.50]And leave this old Nebraska town
[02:46.50]
[02:49.50]I think about my life gone by
[02:52.50]And how it's done me wrong
[02:56.50]There's no escape for me this time
[03:00.50]All of my rescues are gone, long gone
[04:07.50][03:10.50]
[03:35.50]I swear I left her by the river
[03:43.50]I swear I left her safe and sound
[03:51.50]I need to make it to the river
[03:59.50]And leave this old Nebraska town
