BILLIE PIPER - The Tide Is High lyrics
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no
It's not the things you do, that try and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things, you do for me
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her boy
But I'll wait right here 'till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen some how
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments wait for a life time treasure
Every girl wants you to be her boy
But I'll wait right here 'till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen some how
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments wait for a life time treasure
The tide is high and I'm holding on
