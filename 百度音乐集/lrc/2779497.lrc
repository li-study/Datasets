[00:00.00]费翔 - She
[00:15.64]
[00:17.64]She
[00:18.89]May be the face I can't forget
[00:22.22]A trace of pleasure or regret
[00:25.66]May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
[00:31.43]She may be the song that summer sings
[00:36.10]May be the chill that autumn brings
[00:39.54]May be a hundred different things
[00:43.02]Within the measure of a day
[00:47.20]
[00:48.75]She
[00:49.98]May be the beauty or the beast
[00:53.33]May be the famine or the feast
[00:56.90]May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
[01:02.68]She may be the mirror of my dreams
[01:07.17]A smile reflected in a stream
[01:10.74]She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell
[01:18.70]
[01:51.16]She who always seems so happy in a crowd
[01:55.66]Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
[01:59.30]No one's allowed to see them when they cry
[02:04.99]She may be the love that cannot hope to last
[02:09.52]May come to me from shadows of the past
[02:13.04]That I'll remember till the day I die
[02:18.63]
[02:19.09]She
[02:20.03]May be the reason I survive
[02:23.27]The why and wherefore I'm alive
[02:26.82]The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years
[02:32.79]Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
[02:37.34]And make them all my souvenirs
[02:40.77]For where she goes I've got to be
[02:44.15]The meaning of my life is
[02:47.87]She she oh she
