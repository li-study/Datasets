[00:15.00]Sweetest Goodbye
[00:17.94]Where you are seems to be
[00:20.80]As far as an eternity
[00:23.71]Outstretched arms open hearts
[00:26.56]And if it never ends then when do we start?
[00:30.47]I'll never leave you behind
[00:33.58]Or treat you unkind
[00:36.38]I know you understand
[00:42.34]And with a tear in my eye
[00:45.50]Give me the sweetest goodbye
[00:49.28]That I ever did receive
[00:53.38]Pushing forward and arching back
[00:59.34]Bring me closer to heart attack
[01:05.21]Say goodbye and just fly away
[01:11.08]When you comeback
[01:13.53]I have some things to say
[01:16.69]How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
[01:23.61]When you get home
[01:28.46]There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
[01:35.22]So I can show you how I
[01:39.89]Dream away everyday
[01:42.84]Try so hard to disregard
[01:45.66]The rhythm of the rain that drops
[01:48.56]And coincides with the beating of my heart
[01:52.67]I'll never leave you behind
[01:55.62]Or treat you unkind
[01:58.53]I know you understand
[02:04.24]And with a tear in my eye
[02:07.30]Give me the sweetest goodbye
[02:11.76]That I ever did receive
[02:15.36]Pushing forward and arching back
[02:21.27]Bring me closer to heart attack
[02:27.09]Say goodbye and just fly away
[02:32.90]When you comeback
[02:35.41]I have some things to say
[02:38.81]How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
[02:45.39]When you get home
[02:50.56]There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
[02:57.03]So I can show you how I feel
