[00:40.38]I remember Paris in '49.
[00:47.88]The Champs Elysee,
[00:51.29]Saint Michel and old Beaujolais wine.
[00:56.25]And I recall that you were mine
[01:01.70]in those Parisienne days.
[01:38.84]Looking back at the photographs.
[01:47.34]Those summer days spent outside corner cafes.
[01:55.28]Oh, I could write you paragraphs,
[02:01.56]about my old Parisienne days.
