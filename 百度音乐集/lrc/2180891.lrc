[00:18.54]Innocent, that's my way
[00:27.66]Don't know where I am
[00:35.49]Catch my breath, can't think straight
[00:44.04]Gotta make a plan
[00:48.46]
[00:50.94]But I get butterflies
[00:54.79]Water in my eyes
[00:57.70]
[00:58.41]'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
[01:02.74]Fragile when you call
[01:06.49]This could be the nearest thing to love
[01:14.24]And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
[01:18.54]Fragile feeling small
[01:22.40]This could be the closest thing to love
[01:28.15]
[01:31.12]Shake and sweat, wipe my brow
[01:38.83]Scared of what's to come
[01:46.59]Lie awake, toss and turn
[01:54.82]Am I the only one
[02:00.06]
[02:01.40]But I get butterflies
[02:05.45]Water in my eyes
[02:08.84]
[02:09.03]'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
[02:13.31]Fragile when you call
[02:16.78]This could be the nearest thing to love
[02:24.49]And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
[02:29.20]Fragile feeling small
[02:32.74]This could be the closest thing to love
[02:40.14]
[02:41.09]But I get butterflies
[02:44.86]Water in my eyes
[02:49.39]When I think of you
[02:52.91]I could break in two
[02:54.86]
[03:29.38][02:58.51]'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
[03:33.87][03:03.17]Fragile when you call
[03:37.62][03:06.61]This could be the nearest thing to love
[03:14.23]And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
[03:18.72]Fragile feeling small
[03:22.41]This could be the closest thing to love
