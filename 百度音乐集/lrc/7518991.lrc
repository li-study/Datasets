[00:03.50]
[00:07.00]Tori Amos ( Little Earthquakes )
[00:10.50]
[00:13.55]All the world just stopped now
[00:17.97]So you say you don't wanna stay together anymore
[00:25.86]Let me take a deep breath, babe
[00:29.65]If you need me, me and Neil'll be hangin' out with the dream king
[00:37.87]Neil said hi by the way
[00:42.05]I don't believe you're leaving 'cause me and Charles Manson
[00:46.85]Like the same ice cream
[00:50.17]I think it's that girl
[00:53.94]And I think there're pieces of me you've never seen
[01:00.44]Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen well
[01:06.36]All the world is
[01:12.15]All I am
[01:18.23]The black of the blackest ocean
[01:24.47]And that tear in your hand
[01:31.89]All the world is
[01:36.63]Danglin'... danglin'... danglin' for me
[01:44.59]Darling, you don't know the power that you have
[01:48.51]With that tear in your hand
[01:56.20]Tear in your hand
[02:02.61]Maybe I ain't used to maybes
[02:11.49]Smashing in a cold room
[02:14.68]Cutting my hands up
[02:17.70]Everytime I touch you
[02:20.70]Maybe
[02:24.10]Maybe it's time to wave goodbye now
[02:31.82]Time to wave goodbye now
[02:40.60]Caught a ride with the moon
[02:44.29]I know I know you well
[02:49.84]Well better than I used to
[02:51.85]Haze all clouded up my mind in the daze
[02:55.27]Of the why it could've never been
[02:57.31]So you say and I say
[02:58.94]You know you're full of wish
[03:00.13]And your 'baby baby baby babies'
[03:02.20]I tell you there're pieces of me you've never seen
[03:08.13]Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen well
[03:16.32]All the world is
[03:20.65]All I am
[03:26.55]The black of the blackest ocean
[03:32.72]And that tear in your hand
[03:40.28]All the world is
[03:44.70]Danglin'... danglin'... danglin' for me
[03:51.12]Darling, you don't know the power that you have
[03:56.34]With that tear in your hand
[04:04.62]Tear in your hand
[04:09.37]With that tear in your hand
