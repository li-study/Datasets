[00:01.35]Green Day - Words I Might Have Ate lyrics
[00:03.17]
[00:10.51]Now it seems I can't
[00:12.00]keep my mind of you
[00:15.64]My brain drifts back to better days
[00:17.53]we've been through
[00:20.05]Like sitting on blacktop
[00:21.67]of the school grounds
[00:24.96]The love I bitched
[00:26.23]about I finally found
[00:28.49]
[00:29.36]But now it's gone
[00:32.19]and I take the blame
[00:33.87]So there's nothing I can do
[00:35.61]but take the pain
[00:38.46]Why?
[00:39.49]
[00:43.40]Now I dwell on
[00:44.92]what you remind me of
[00:48.46]A sweet young girl
[00:49.03]who sacrificed her love
[00:52.72]As for me...
[00:53.93]I am blind without a cause
[00:57.67]And now I reazlied
[00:59.08]what I have lost
[01:01.71]It was something real
[01:04.86]that I could have had
[01:06.74]Now I play the fool
[01:08.07]whose stable soul's gone bad
[01:11.20]Why?
[01:11.71]
[01:22.08]Tell me the words
[01:23.10]I might have said
[01:26.92]That's pumping pressure deep
[01:28.14]inside my head
[01:31.28]Was it bad enough to be too late?
[01:35.92]Just tell me
[01:41.16][01:38.99][01:37.04]the words I might have ate
[01:44.59]
[01:53.75]But now it's gone
[01:56.40]and I take the blame
[01:58.22]So there's nothing I can do
[02:00.05]but take the pain
[02:17.05][02:14.85][02:12.66][02:10.16][02:07.86][02:05.36][02:02.92]Why?
