[03:42.44][00:03.57]Michael Learns To Rock: Someday
[00:25.13]In my search for freedom
[00:28.09]and peace of mind
[00:31.22]I've left the memories behind
[00:37.10]Wanna start a new life
[00:39.95]but it seems to be rather absurd
[00:45.08]when I know the truth
[00:47.57]is that I always think of you
[03:17.62][03:16.74][02:54.65][01:41.07][00:51.43]Someday someway
[03:20.81][02:57.34][01:43.94][00:54.63]together we will be baby
[03:23.81][02:59.98][01:47.03][00:57.41]I will take and you will take your time
[03:29.49][03:04.85][01:52.35][01:02.78]We'll wait for our fate
[03:32.49][03:09.08][01:55.58][01:05.89]cos' nobody owns us baby
[03:35.60][03:12.21][01:58.73][01:09.08]We can shake we can shake the rock
[01:14.91]Try to throw the picture out of my mind
[01:20.68]try to leave the memories behind
[01:26.55]Here by the ocean
[01:29.15]wave's carry voices from you
[01:34.59]Do you know the truth
[01:36.77]I am thinking of you too
[02:04.34]The love we had together
[02:07.21]just fades away in time
[02:10.27]And now you've got your own world
[02:13.31]and I guess I've got mine
[02:16.13]But the passion that you planted
[02:18.84]in the middle of my heart
[02:21.57]is a passion that will never stop
