[00:01.31]Thinking About You
[00:02.59]
[00:03.10]Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'
[00:10.49]And the leaves were fallin' down softly
[00:18.22]My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
[00:25.21]And I was thinkin' about you
[00:31.62]
[00:33.94]Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving
[00:41.60]You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
[00:49.44]I guess it's time for me to let you go
[00:57.50]And I've been thinkin' about you
[01:05.41]I've been thinkin' about you
[01:11.98]
[01:43.82]When you sail across the ocean waters
[01:51.57]And you reach the other side safely
[01:59.33]Could you smile a little smile for me?
[02:07.34]'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you
[02:12.25]
[02:15.00]I'll be thinkin' about you
[02:22.81]I'll be thinkin' about you
[02:29.58]I'll be thinkin' about you
[02:38.06]
