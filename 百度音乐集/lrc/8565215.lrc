[00:02.00]The Maccabees - Wall Of Arms
[00:07.00]
[00:18.95]I woke up with a loved one's eyes upon me
[00:25.52]Loved one's arms around me
[00:31.52]Oh...She's my one and only
[00:37.62]I grew up in the bosom of my family
[00:43.50]Eight strong arms around me
[00:49.63]Oh...from the seed they've grown me
[00:55.05]And I thank those
[00:57.91]Those who kept me company
[01:01.59]They are a wall of arms around me
[01:05.71]Oh...it is they who are my army
[01:25.61]Oh? it is they who are my army
[01:31.63]Through these eyes
[01:34.51]There's no god above me
[01:37.98]No devil below me
[01:41.46]No purgatory, no pearly gates
[01:43.43]The worms are what await me
[01:47.67]It's only me that can forgive me and
[01:50.69]I have faith, oh...I have faith
[01:59.51]I have faith, oh...I have faith
[02:06.52]In those who put up with me
[02:25.18]She's my one and only
[02:28.19]If I'm the seed they've grown me
[02:30.29]They who are my army
[02:32.40]The wall of arms around me
[02:34.24]She's my one and only
[02:36.86]If I'm the seed they've grown me
[02:39.04]They who are my army
[02:41.38]The wall of arms around me
