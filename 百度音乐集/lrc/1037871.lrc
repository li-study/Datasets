[00:07.91]My friends from high school
[00:11.34]Married their high school boyfriends
[00:15.12]Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
[00:20.45]Where their parents live
[03:08.84][00:21.92]But I, I could never follow
[03:16.11][01:48.67][01:40.61][00:29.32]No I, I could never follow
[00:37.58]I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
[00:44.91]Lived like a gypsy
[00:48.81]Six strong hands on the steering wheel
[00:51.81]I've been a long time gone now
[03:27.71][00:55.75]Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
[00:59.37]But I've always found my way somehow
[01:03.15]By taking the long way
[04:16.91][04:09.41][04:01.94][03:54.40][03:46.95][03:39.40][02:18.83][02:11.26][01:15.04][01:07.55]Taking the long way around

[01:26.17]I met the queen of whatever
[01:30.03]Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
[01:33.79]Moved with the shakers
[01:37.52]Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
[01:56.02]It's been two long years now
[01:59.32]Since the top of the world came crashing down
[02:03.17]And I'm getting' it back on the road now
[02:06.79]But I'm taking the long way
[02:15.03]I'm taking the long way
[02:54.17]Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
[02:57.44]I opened my mouth and I heard myself
[03:01.67]It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
[03:04.95]Guess I could have made it easier on myself
[03:23.85]Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
[03:31.04]If you ever want to find me I can still be found
