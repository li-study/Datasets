[00:01.42]Paul McCartney - It's Only a Paper Moon
[00:03.53]
[00:09.22]Say, its only a paper moon
[00:13.27]Sailing over a cardboard sea
[00:17.35]But it wouldn't be make-believe
[00:21.04]If you believed in me
[00:23.76]
[00:25.70]Yes, it's only a canvas sky
[00:29.62]Hanging over a muslin tree
[00:33.83]But it wouldn't be make-believe
[00:37.34]If you believed in me
[00:40.38]
[01:44.02][00:41.27]Without your love
[01:47.66][00:45.40]It's a honky-tonk parade
[01:51.65][00:49.11]Without your love
[01:55.77][00:53.09]It's a melody played in a penny arcade
[02:00.59][00:57.78]
[02:01.33][00:58.61]It's a Barnum and Bailey world
[02:04.42][01:02.53]Just as phony as it can be
[02:08.47][01:06.55]But it wouldn't be make-believe
[02:19.73][02:15.70][02:11.97][01:09.91]If you believed in me
[02:25.27][01:16.49]
