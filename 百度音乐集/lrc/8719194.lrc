[00:04.50]Careless whisper-Wham
[00:26.24]I feel so unsure
[00:31.04]As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[00:38.50]As the music dies...
[00:41.91]Something in your eyes
[00:44.83]Calls to mind a silver screen
[00:47.79]And all its sad goodbyes
[00:51.81]I'm never gonna dance again
[00:53.99]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[00:57.63]Though it's easy to pretend
[01:00.21]I know you're not a fool
[01:03.42]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[01:06.55]And waste a chance that I'd been given
[01:09.50]So I'm never gonna dance again
[01:12.62]The way I danced with you
[01:29.09]Time can never mend
[01:34.45]The careless whisper of a good friend
[01:41.50]To the heart and mind
[01:44.89]If your answer's kind...
[01:47.89]There's no comfort in the truth
[01:50.72]Pain is all you'll find
[01:54.77]I'm never gonna dance again
[01:56.86]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:00.89]Though it's easy to pretend
[02:03.35]I know you're not a fool
[02:06.53]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[02:09.63]And waste a chance that I'd been given
[02:12.84]So I'm never gonna dance again
[02:15.93]The way I danced with you
[02:43.93]Tonight the music seems so loud
[02:46.61]I wish that we could lose this crowd
[02:50.50]Maybe it's better this way
[02:52.83]We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
[02:57.35]We could have been so good together
[02:59.50]We could have lived this dance forever...
[03:02.96]But now, who's gonna dance with me?
[03:07.81]Please stay
[03:10.35]I'm never gonna dance again
[03:13.10]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:16.53]Though it's easy to pretend
[03:19.30]I know you're not a fool
[03:22.45]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[03:25.70]And waste a chance that I'd been given
[03:29.02]So I'm never gonna dance again
[03:31.85]The way I danced with you
[03:47.80]Now that you're gone...
[04:03.98]Was what I did so wrong?
[04:05.55]So wrong that you had to leave me alone?
