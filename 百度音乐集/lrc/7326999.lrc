[00:26.60]On a dark desert highway
[00:30.01]Cool wind in my hair
[00:33.18]Warm smell of colitas rising
[00:39.55]Up through the air Up ahead in the distance.
[00:42.60]I saw a shimmering light
[00:45.84]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[00:48.73]I had to stop for the night
[00:51.94]There she stood in the doorway
[00:55.01]I heard the mission bell
[00:58.06]And I was thinking to myself
[01:00.53]This could be heaven or this could be hell
[01:04.46]Then she lit up a candle
[01:07.50]And she showed me the way
[01:10.58]There were voices down in corridor
[01:13.67]I thought I heard them say... ...
[01:16.87]Welcome to the Hotel California
[01:22.49]Such a lovely place (such a lovely face)
[01:29.12]There's plenty of rooms at the
[01:30.91]Hotel California
[01:34.94]Any time of year you can find it here
[01:41.65]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
[01:44.81]She got the Mercedes-Benz
[01:48.28]She got a lot of pretty,
[01:54.33]Pretty boys that she calls friends
[01:57.02]Sweet summer sweat
[02:00.60]Some dance to remember
[02:03.76]Some dance to forget
[02:06.81]So I called up the captain
[02:10.05]Please bring me my wine
[02:12.33]He said we haven't had that spirit
[02:16.52]Here since nineteen sixty nine
[02:19.60]And still those voices are
[02:22.42]Calling from far away
[02:25.89]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[02:29.05]Just to hear them say... ...
[02:32.06]Welcome to the Hotel
[02:33.39]Calofornia Such a lovely place
[02:39.40](such a loveely face)
[02:44.35]They livin'it up at the Hotel California
[02:50.41]What a nice surprise bring your alibis
[02:57.62]Mirrors on the ceilling
[03:00.70]The pink champagne on ice
[03:02.92]And she said we are all just prisoners
[03:05.81]Here of our own device
[03:10.23]And in the master's chambers
[03:13.58]They gathered for the feast
[03:16.78]They stab it with their steely knives
[03:19.40]But they just can't kill the beast
[03:23.10]Last thing I remember,
[03:25.73]I was running for the door
[03:29.38]I had to find the passage back
[03:31.97]To the place I was before
[03:35.70]Relax said programmed to receive
[03:42.21]You can check out any time you like
[03:45.26]But you can never leave
[03:47.27]
