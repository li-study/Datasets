[00:24.90]I guess the time was right for us to say
[00:32.04]We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day
[00:42.52]We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
[00:49.59]We know our dreams can all come true
[00:53.80]With love that we can share
[00:59.95]With you I never wonder
[01:03.92]Will you be there for me
[01:07.64]With you I never wonder
[01:11.01]You're the right one for me
[01:17.64]I finally found the love of a lifetime
[01:23.72]A love to last my whole life through
[01:33.03]I finally found the love of a lifetime
[01:39.68]Forever in my heart
[01:44.53]I finally found the love of a lifetime
[01:50.76]
[01:56.63]With every kiss our love is like brand-new
[02:03.08]And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
[02:12.06]Still we both know that the road is long
[02:19.54](But) we know that we will be together
[02:23.69]Because our love is strong
[02:29.67]I finally found the love of a lifetime
[02:37.39]A love to last my whole life through
[02:45.16]I finally found the love of a lifetime
[02:51.74]Forever in my heart
[02:57.18]I finally found the love of a lifetime
