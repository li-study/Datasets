[00:02.51]
[00:04.06]It's time to make a start
[00:08.82]to get to know your heart
[00:13.63]time to show your face
[00:18.82]time to take your place
[00:24.21]
[00:33.39]In every speck of dust
[00:38.27]In every universe
[00:43.08]When you feel most alone
[00:48.04]you will not be alone
[00:51.34]
[00:52.29]Just shine a light on me, shine a light
[01:02.14]I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
[01:11.81]and you will see my shadow on every wall
[01:21.72]and you will see my footprint on every floor
[01:32.34]
[01:41.89]It only takes a spark to tear the world apart
[01:51.65]these tiny little things that make it all begin
[01:59.70]
[02:00.88]Just shine a light on me, shine a light
[02:10.55]I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
[02:20.40]and you will see my shadow on every wall
[02:30.20]and you'll see my reflection in your free fall
[02:40.94]
[02:42.80]Ooh, Oh Ooh, Ooh, Oh Ooh!
[02:59.31]Just shine a light on me, shine a light
[03:09.06]I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
[03:18.86]'Cause when your back's against the wall
[03:23.65]that's when you show no fear at all
[03:28.51]and when you're running out of time
[03:33.24]that's when your hit tune start to rhyme
[03:37.03]
[03:38.09]We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
[03:47.50]We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
[03:57.22]We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
[04:06.84]We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
[04:14.06]
[04:20.68]Oh Ooh, Oh Ooh, Oh Ooh, Oh Ooh!
