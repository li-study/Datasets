[00:09.83]I wake up in the morning
[00:13.91]Stay in bed and watch you sleep
[00:18.06]In the middle of yawning
[00:21.45]You reach out to me
[00:25.03]
[00:25.69]Time flies by like restless birds up in the sky
[00:33.99]This is the kind of moment that makes eveything worthwhile
[00:40.75]
[00:41.96]Here in your arms where I lay
[00:44.27]Far away from the stress and strain
[00:50.04]Oh what a bliss to be here in your innocent world my dear
[00:57.58]
[00:58.42]Stay a while in this state of mind
[01:06.27]Safe from harm
[01:10.29]Morningcharm
[01:13.81]
[01:14.54]I see you open your eyes now
[01:19.03]The pure image of innocence
[01:23.15]Light falls in through the window
[01:26.13]As you go back to sleep
[01:29.64]
[01:30.75]Time flies by like restless birds up in the sky
[01:38.93]This is the kind of moment that makes everything worthwhile
[01:46.35]
[01:47.25]Here in your arms where I lay
[01:49.56]Far away from the stress and strain
