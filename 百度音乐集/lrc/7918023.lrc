[00:04.20]All Tomorrow's Parties Lyrics
[00:12.25]Artist(Band):Velvet Underground
[00:19.21]By:拉登快跑
[00:30.12]And what costume shall the poor girl wear
[00:39.44]To all tomorrow's parties
[00:47.27]A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
[00:56.41]To all tomorrow's parties
[01:03.43]
[01:04.19]And where will she go and what shall she do
[01:09.10]When midnight comes around
[01:16.98]She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
[01:25.96]And cry behind the door
[01:31.68]
[02:11.81]And what costume shall the poor girl wear
[02:21.02]To all tomorrow's parties
[02:28.95]Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
[02:37.87]To all tomorrow's parties
[02:43.67]
[02:45.74]And what will she do with Thursday's rags
[02:50.68]When Monday comes around
[02:58.70]She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
[03:07.48]And cry behind the door
[03:15.41]
[04:11.03]And what costume shall the poor girl wear
[04:20.42]To all tomorrow's parties
[04:28.12]For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
[04:36.70]For whom none will go mourning
[04:43.07]
[04:44.21]A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
[04:49.18]Of rags and silks, a costume
[04:56.87]Fit for one who sits and cries
[05:05.69]For all tomorrow's parties
