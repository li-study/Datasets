[00:03.40]Pardon Me
[00:08.44]Weezer
[00:13.52]
[00:19.73]I tried my best
[00:24.29]I gave my all
[00:28.52]Sometimes my best wasn't good enough
[00:34.18]For you
[02:53.99][00:37.46]Sometimes I let you go
[02:58.37][00:42.03]Sometimes I hurt you so
[03:02.82][00:46.45]I know that I can be the meanest person in the world
[03:13.89][02:05.45][00:57.32]So I apologize to you
[03:18.73][02:10.32][01:02.23]And to anyone else that I hurt too
[03:23.59][02:15.08][01:06.98]I may not be the perfect soul
[03:28.20][02:19.61][01:11.48]But I can't learn self control
[03:41.46][02:24.36][01:15.69]So pardon me! pardon me!
[03:59.48][03:51.13][03:46.49][02:28.75][01:20.75]pardon me my friend!
[04:11.00][02:35.11][01:26.78]
[01:28.15]I never thought
[01:32.57]That anyone
[01:36.82]Was more important than the plans
[01:42.60]I made
[01:45.84]But now I feel the shame
[01:50.30]There's no one else to blame
[01:54.74]For all the broken hearts scattered on the field of war
[03:32.77]And in my heart I feel its true
[03:37.21]So I'll be there with you!!!
