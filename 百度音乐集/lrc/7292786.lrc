[00:00.00]
[00:04.92]Never really said too much
[00:08.24]Afraid it wouldn't be enough
[00:11.81]Just try to keep my spirits up
[00:14.11]When there's no point in grieving
[00:19.28]Doesn't matter anyway
[00:22.71]Words could never make me stay
[00:26.47]Words will never take my place
[00:28.64]When you know I'm leaving
[00:32.10]
[00:32.45]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[00:35.48]Something I rely on to get home
[00:39.49]One I can feel at night
[00:41.95]A naked light, a fire to keep me warm
[00:46.35]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[00:49.99]Even in the daylight, shine on
[00:54.08]And when it's late at night you can look inside
[00:58.21]You won't feel so alone
[01:03.89]
[01:04.86]You know we've been down that road
[01:08.18]What seems a thousand times before
[01:11.93]My back to a closing door and my eyes to the seasons
[01:19.10]That roll out underneath my heels
[01:22.61]And you don't know how bad it feels
[01:26.39]To leave the only one that I have ever believed in
[01:32.07]
[01:32.41]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[01:35.47]Something I rely on to get home
[01:39.45]One I can feel at night
[01:41.93]A naked light, a fire to keep me warm
[01:46.32]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[01:49.98]Even in the daylight, shine on
[01:54.05]And when it's late at night you can look inside
[01:58.22]You won't feel so alone,
[02:04.77]ooh, yeah
[02:11.72]
[02:19.81]Sometimes it feels like we've run out of luck
[02:27.17]When the signal keeps on breaking up
[02:34.35]When the wires cross in my brain
[02:37.91]You'll start my heart again
[02:41.48]When I come along, yeah
[02:49.78]
[02:50.65]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[02:54.27]Something I rely on to get home
[02:58.20]One I can feel at night
[03:00.55]A naked light, a fire to keep me warm
[03:05.31]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[03:08.78]Even in the daylight, shine on
[03:12.63]And when it's late at night you can look inside
[03:16.98]You won't feel so alone
[03:19.96]Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
[03:23.28]Even in the daylight, shine on
[03:27.14]And when it's late at night you can look inside
[03:31.55]You won't feel so alone
