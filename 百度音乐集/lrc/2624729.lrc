[00:11.60]Looking out across the nighttime
[00:16.14]The city winks a sleepless eye
[00:21.64]Hear her voice shake my window
[00:26.58]Sweet seducing sighs
[00:31.60]Get me out into the nighttime
[00:36.83]Four walls won't hold me tonight
[00:41.91]If this town is just an apple,
[00:46.82]then let me take a bite
[01:02.06][00:52.08]If they say why, why,
[01:04.82][00:54.90]tell 'em that it's human nature
[01:07.99][00:57.68]Why, why, does he do me that way
[01:11.93]
[01:13.47]Reaching out to touch a stranger
[01:17.91]Electric eyes are ev' rywhere
[01:23.08]See that girl, she knows I'm watching
[01:28.44]She likes the way I stare
[01:43.29][01:33.21]If they say why, why,
[01:46.48][01:36.08]tell 'em that it's human nature
[01:49.25][01:38.90]Why, why, does he do me that way,
[01:54.01]I like lovin' this way
[01:59.76]
[02:14.82]Looking out across the morning
[02:20.27]Where the city's heart begins to beat
[02:25.23]Reaching out I touch her shoulder
[02:30.31]I'm dreaming of the street
[03:26.48][03:16.30][03:05.98][02:55.53][02:45.31][02:34.91]If they say why, why,
