[00:32.00]
[00:55.15]Watching them come and go
[00:59.39]the templars and the saracens.
[01:03.73]They're travelling the holy land opening telegrams.
[01:11.57]Torture comes and torture goes
[01:15.94]knights who'd give you anything.
[01:20.04]They bear the cross of coeur de leon
[01:24.29]salvation for the mirror blind.
[01:27.94]But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
[01:36.78]Pray and the heathen lie will disappear.
[01:46.96]
[01:49.04]Prayers they hide the saddest view.
[01:56.03]Believing the strangest things - loving the alien.
[02:04.29]And your prayers they break the sky in two.
[02:12.57]Believing the strangest things - loving the alien.
[02:20.33]
[02:44.60]Thinking of a different time
[02:49.22]palestine a modern problem.
[02:53.41]Bounty and your wealth in land
[02:57.41]terror: in a best laid plan.
[03:02.26]Watching them come and go
[03:05.66]tomorrows and the yesterdays.
[03:09.60]Christians and the unbelievers hanging by the cross and nail.
[03:17.67]But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
[03:27.51]
[03:37.10]You pray till the break of dawn.
[03:45.31]Believing the strangest things - loving the alien.
[03:53.85]And you'll believe you're loving the alien.
[04:02.72]Believing the strangest things - loving the alien.
[04:10.15]Believing the strangest things - loving the alien.
