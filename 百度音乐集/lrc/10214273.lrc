[00:18.91]Met my old lover in the grocery store
[00:23.00]The snow was falling Christmas Eve
[00:27.93]I stole behind her in the frozen foods
[00:30.45]And I touched her on the sleeve
[00:35.85]She didn't recognize the face at first
[00:40.31]But then her eyes flew open wide
[00:44.86]She went to hug me and she spelled her purse
[00:48.71]And we laughed until we cried
[01:11.17]We took her groceries to the checkout stand
[01:15.73]The food was totaled up and bagged
[01:20.15]We stood there lost in our embarrassment
[01:23.42]As the conversation dragged
[01:29.08]We went to have ourselves a drink or two
[01:33.59]But couldn't find an open bar
[01:38.04]We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
[01:41.27]And we drank it in her car
[01:47.24]We drank a toast to innocence
[01:50.13]We drank a toast to now
[01:57.10]And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
[01:59.05]But neither one knew how
[02:04.44]She said she'd married her an architect
[02:08.33]Who kept her warm and safe and dry
[02:15.17]She would have liked to say she loved the man
[02:16.47]But she didn't like to lie
[02:21.92]I said the years had been a friend to her
[02:26.24]And that her eyes were still as blue
[02:30.69]But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw
[02:34.26]Doubt or gratitude
[02:39.70]She said she saw me in the record stores
[02:44.14]And that I must be doing well
[02:48.25]I said the audience was heavenly
[02:51.73]But the traveling was hell
[02:57.91]We drank a toast to innocence
[03:00.62]We drank a toast to now
[03:06.51]And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
[03:10.36]But neither one knew how
[03:14.63]We drank a toast to innocence
[03:18.11]We drank a toast to time
[03:23.36]Reliving in our eloquence
[03:27.29]Another 'auld lang syne'
[03:36.06]The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
[03:40.45]And running out of things to say
[03:44.63]She gave a kiss to me as I got out
[03:48.19]And I watched her drive away
[03:53.62]Just for a moment I was back at school
[03:58.77]And felt that old familiar pain
[04:06.26]And as I turned to make my way back home
[04:10.65]The snow turned into rain.
