[00:15.76]Guess you never really know
[00:16.89]Just what you've got
[00:17.87]Until you finally realize
[00:19.57]You could be gone
[00:20.94]And know that I've been taking you for granted
[00:22.51]For the longest time
[00:25.47]All you want
[00:26.36]Is someone who really cares
[00:28.21]And I didn't even
[00:29.41]Notice you were there
[00:30.57]I promise I'll never ever
[00:31.62]Make that same mistake not twice
[00:35.56]That was then
[00:36.11]This is now
[00:36.81]Take some time to come around

[00:38.72]Is try again
[00:41.14]Show you how
[00:41.73]I know that it's all about
[00:42.67]Givin' attention to you
[00:44.36]I was a fool for way too long

[00:50.95]This is now
[00:51.53]Take some time to figure out
[00:52.13]Love is all you need
[00:57.07]
[01:01.33]Guess I never thought about it before
[01:03.30]I was thinkin' of myself
[01:04.61]And nothing more
[01:05.70]Didn't even wanna try to find out
[01:07.46]How you really feel (how you really feel)
[01:10.64]Now I see
[01:11.40]That I'm the lucky one
[01:12.54]It's true
[01:13.48]What we got
[01:14.68]You know I never want to lose
[01:15.84]I was trippin' in a fantasy
[01:17.20]And missing what was real
[01:20.41]That was then

[01:37.66]Love is all you need
[01:40.09]I used to be someone
[01:41.63]Who really only really though about
[01:43.32]Themself and no one else
[01:46.33]And you could tell baby
[01:50.02]But as before
[01:50.73]I understood
[01:51.83]Be with you
[01:52.71]'Cause something is good
[01:53.91]Gotta let her know
[01:56.43]And I want you to know
