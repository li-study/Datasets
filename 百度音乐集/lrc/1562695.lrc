[00:22.30]Every night I find it's so hard to sleep
[00:26.43]'Cause I keep thinking of you
[00:29.34]And these feelings run deep
[00:31.74]Oh baby Itry to hide
[00:34.34]All these feelings for you
[00:37.07]I keep them battled inside
[00:39.78]I don't know what else to do
[02:29.07][01:35.78][00:42.31]So I cry and nobody hears me
[02:34.81][01:41.32][00:48.35]I cry,it's my only solution
[02:40.13][01:46.70][00:53.29]I cry,to all this confusion
[02:45.34][01:52.04][00:58.73]I cry, with all of my heart
[02:50.73][01:57.70][01:04.41]I cry…
[02:01.76][01:08.86]
[01:15.34]Sometimes I wonder
[01:17.53]In the blink of my eye
[01:19.78]Would you be willing to love me
[01:22.58]Would you give it a try
[01:25.05]I don't know how else to show you
[01:27.91]That our love could be real
[01:30.38]I'd be eternally faithfull
[01:33.79]Forever I'd feel
[02:08.81]No one can tell me that I may be wrong
[02:12.97]'Cause I know in my heart
[02:15.87]This feeling's still burning strong
[02:18.30]Can't get you out of my head
[02:21.00]Can't get you out of my heart
[02:23.85]Can't get you out of my life
[02:26.43]No matter if we're apart
[02:54.07]And nobody hears me
[02:56.21]I cry,it's my only solution
[03:01.38]I cry,to all this confusion
[03:06.82]I cry, with all of my heart
[03:12.43]I cry…
