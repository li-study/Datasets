
[00:04.27]Selective Memory
[00:06.27]Eels
[00:08.27]
[00:12.06]If I lay my head down
[00:15.73]I will see you in my dream
[00:21.02]Wearing that polka dot dress
[00:24.78]And sitting by the stream
[00:30.04]Leaning in to hear you
[00:33.51]You will whisper in my ear
[00:38.95]And everything I need to know
[00:43.88]I finally hear
[00:46.46]
[00:50.32]I wish I could remember
[00:54.88]But my selective memory won't let me
[01:00.07]
[01:09.28]When I was a baby
[01:12.14]We would go out to the park
[01:18.05]And sit out in the fountain
[01:21.38]Splashing 'round until it's dark
[01:27.41]The days go on forever
[01:30.69]When you only know that much
[01:36.39]And everything you need to know
[01:40.69]Is answered with one touch
[01:48.25]I wish I could remember
[01:53.17]But my selective memory won't let me
[01:58.84]
