[00:14.70]日剧《白色巨塔》主题曲
[00:19.43]
[00:25.01]Amazing grace!
[00:29.83]How sweet the sound.
[00:34.73]That saved a wretch like me!
[00:43.82]I once was lost, but now I\\\'m found,
[00:53.21]Was blind, but now I see.
[01:03.36]
[01:12.38]T\\\'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[01:21.71]And grace my fear relieved;
[01:31.22]How precious did that grace appear,
[01:40.75]The hour I first believed.
[01:51.42]
[02:08.92]Through many dangers, toils and snares
[02:18.31]We have already come
[02:27.64]T\\\'was grace that brought us safe thus far
[02:37.36]And grace will lead us home.
[02:46.62]When we\\\'ve been there ten thousand years
[02:56.26]Bright shining as the sun;
[03:05.55]We\\\'ve no less days to sing god\\\'s praise
[03:15.41]Than when we\\\'d first begun.
[03:24.50]Than when we\\\'d first begun.
[03:39.39]
