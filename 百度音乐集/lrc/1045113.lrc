[00:46.15]It's all the same
[00:49.68]only the names will change
[00:52.91]Everyday
[00:55.16]it seems we're wasting away
[00:59.39]Another place
[01:02.35]where the faces are so cold
[01:05.68]I'd drive all night
[01:08.84]just to get back home
[01:12.14]I'm a cowboy,
[01:15.31]on a steel horse I ride
[01:18.28]I'm wanted dead or alive
[01:25.47]Wanted dead or alive
[01:31.74]
[01:44.97]Sometimes I sleep
[01:48.20]sometimes it's not for days
[01:51.24]And the people I meet

[02:00.68]By the bottle that you drink
[02:03.78]And times when you're all
[02:07.05]alone all you do is think
[02:10.25]I'm a cowboy,
[02:13.50]on a steel horse I ride
[02:16.73]I'm wanted dead or alive
[02:23.14]Wanted dead or alive
