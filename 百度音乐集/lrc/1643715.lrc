[00:01.12]John Waller - Quest
[00:07.89]
[00:15.29]It's like a blind man in a dark room
[00:22.52]Looking for a black cat that isn't there
[00:33.07]It's like a man overboard in the high seas
[00:40.94]Swimming for his life to find land anywhere
[03:02.00][01:53.88][00:47.15]
[03:03.17][01:54.29][00:47.59]Everybody knows emptiness
[03:06.33][01:57.72][00:51.72]Everywhere they’re all on a quest
[03:08.47][02:01.89][00:55.38]But nobody seems to know
[03:13.24][02:05.19][00:58.43]The reason for their restlessness
[03:15.71][02:08.81][01:02.27]Everybody’s lost in aimlessness
[03:19.40][02:12.15][01:06.40]But somebody brought hope (to hopelessness)
[03:23.35][02:16.82][01:10.32]Now everybody needs to know
[03:26.04][02:19.74][01:12.71]That they can know
[03:28.36][02:22.36][01:14.61]The master of the quest
[01:22.73]
[01:24.77]It's like Don Quixote on his journey
[01:32.57]Trusty side-kick by his side El Dorado bound
[01:40.34]It's all around you could it be you
[01:47.77]People searching,
[01:49.69]are you searching for what I've found?
[02:25.71]
[02:28.02]Don't you know He’s at your door
[02:35.50]He is the one you're looking for
[02:45.78]Everybody’s lost in aimlessness
[02:49.85]But somebody brought hope (to hopelessness)
[02:53.79]Now everybody needs to know
[02:56.58]That Jesus came to bring them rest
[03:38.10]
[03:41.26]He’s the one you’re looking for…
