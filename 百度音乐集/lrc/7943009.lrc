[00:01.77]Madonna
[00:02.73]
[00:06.51]Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
[00:14.24]Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
[00:18.37]
[00:33.06]I can't help falling in love
[00:35.91]I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
[00:40.75]Kisses sent from heaven above
[00:43.14]They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[00:48.13]When you know the notes to sing
[00:50.32]You can sing most anything
[00:52.39]That's what my mama told me
[00:56.23]Round and round and round you go
[00:58.36]When you find love you'll always know
[01:00.45]I let my father mold me
[01:04.21]Daddy couldn't be all wrong
[01:11.76]And my mama made me learn this song
[01:19.67]That's why
[01:20.85]I can't help falling in love
[01:23.57]I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
[01:28.53]Kisses sent from heaven above
[01:31.68]They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[01:36.48]The deeper I go
[01:40.08]All is fair in love she said
[01:42.38]Think with your heart, not with your head
[01:44.22]That's what my mama told me
[01:48.21]All the little things you do
[01:50.57]Will end up coming back to you
[01:52.14]I let my father mold me
[01:56.16]Daddy couldn't be all wrong
[02:02.08]And my mama made me learn this song
[02:11.76]That's why
[02:12.65]I can't help falling in love
[02:15.69]I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
[02:20.54]Kisses sent from heaven above
[02:23.68]They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[02:28.40]I can't help falling in love
[02:31.60]I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
[02:36.41]Kisses sent from heaven above
[02:39.65]They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[02:44.27]Someone said that romance was dead
[02:47.46]And I believed it instead of remembering
[02:51.60]What my mama told me
[02:54.02]Let my father mold me
[02:55.90]Then you tried to hold me
[02:57.79]You remind me what they said
[03:03.17]This feeling inside
[03:06.99]I can't explain
[03:10.70]But my love is alive
[03:13.76]And I'm never gonna hide it again
[03:16.68]
[03:52.67]Daddy couldn't be all wrong
[03:59.38]And my mama made me learn this song
[04:06.99]That's why
[04:08.50]I can't help falling in love
[04:11.81]I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
[04:16.52]Kisses sent from heaven above
[04:19.72]They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[04:24.53]Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
[04:30.00]Never gonna hide it again
[04:33.63]Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
[04:37.82]Never gonna have to pretend
[04:41.77]Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
[04:45.93]Never gonna hide it again
[04:49.72]Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
[04:54.09]Never gonna have to pretend
[04:56.85]
[04:59.65]You got to just let your body move to the music
[05:04.80]You got to just let your body go with the flow
[05:12.90]Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
[05:21.03]I can't keep from falling in love with you
[05:26.78]You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do
[05:30.80]
