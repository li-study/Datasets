[00:16.92]So I sing you to sleep
[00:20.30]After the loving
[00:23.38]With a song I just wrote yesterday
[00:29.33]And I hope you can hear
[00:32.45]What the words and the music have to say.
[00:37.82]
[00:41.43]It's so hard to explain
[00:44.78]Everything that I'm feeling
[00:47.82]Face to face I just seem to go dry.
[00:53.64]But I love you so much
[00:56.64]That the sound of your voice can get me high.
[01:02.62]
[01:05.88]Thanks for taking me
[01:11.56]On a one way trip to the sun.
[01:17.97]And thanks for turning me
[01:23.76]Into someone.
[01:27.47]
[01:30.03]So I sing you to sleep
[01:34.11]After the loving
[01:36.81]I brush back the hair from your eyes.
[01:42.84]And the love on your face
[01:45.96]Is so real that it makes me want to cry.
[01:51.40]
[01:54.65]And I know that my song
[01:58.03]Isn't saying anything new.
[02:06.75]Oh, but after the loving
[02:11.53]I'm still in love with you.
[02:15.95]
[02:19.69]So I sing you to sleep
