[00:56.68]She can't stop pacing
[00:59.26]She never felt so alive
[01:02.19]Her thoughts are racing
[01:04.65]Set on overdrive
[01:07.24]
[01:07.59]It takes a village
[01:10.21]This she knows is true
[01:13.04]They're expecting her
[01:15.85]And she's got work to do
[01:18.12]
[01:19.03]He helplessly stands by
[01:22.70]It's meaningless to try
[01:26.34]As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
[01:29.81]He says I've never seen her get this bad
[01:34.26]
[01:36.77]Even though she seems so high
[01:40.45]He knows that she can't fly
[01:43.77]And when she falls out of the sky
[01:47.75]He'll be standing by
[01:51.20]
[02:01.93]She was raised in a small midwestern town
[02:07.41]By a charming and eccentric loving father
[02:13.10]She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
[02:18.59]And everyone thought highly of her
[02:22.31]
[02:24.54]And she tried everyday
[02:30.22]With endless drive
[02:32.98]To make the grade
[02:35.89]Then one day
[02:38.06]She woke up to find
[02:41.40]The perfect girl
[02:44.14]Had lost her mind
[02:45.95]
[02:48.03]Once barely taking a break
[02:53.37]Now she sleeps the days away
[02:58.15]She helplessly stands by
[03:01.01]It's meaningless to try
[03:03.95]All she wants to do is cry
[03:07.53]No one ever knew she was so sad
[03:11.57]
[03:13.68]Cause even though she gets so high
[03:16.95]And thinks that she can fly
[03:20.12]She will fall out of the sky
[03:23.99]But in the face of misery
[03:27.36]She found hopefulness
[03:30.86]Feeling better
[03:32.62]She had weathered
[03:35.04]This depression
[03:38.51]
[03:53.76]Much to her advantage
[03:56.87]She resumed her frantic pace
[04:00.70]Boundless power
[04:02.59]Midnight hour
[04:04.00]She enjoyed the race
[04:11.30]
