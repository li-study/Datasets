[00:01.12]Deftones - 976-Evil
[00:05.89]
[00:18.62]For a thousand days
[00:24.56]You've been staring away
[00:29.84]Are you faint
[00:33.96]Are you thinking
[00:37.77]Crack a smile and wink
[00:42.69]It doesn't scare me away
[00:47.87]
[00:48.48]Hit the brakes
[00:52.33]I feel like losing you
[00:58.06]To you
[01:00.96]
[01:01.61]So I gaze
[01:06.39]In your eyes
[01:10.05]And I wonder
[01:13.35]Can you take me up
[01:18.44]Your hands that I'm under
[01:25.40]Come wake me up soon
[01:42.17]
[01:48.10]Take a bow and wave
[01:54.32]As we carry away
[01:59.11]It was great
[02:03.02]But I'm not leaving
[02:06.79]Crack a smile and wink
[02:12.39]It still doesn't scare me away
[02:17.98]
[02:18.57]Hit the brakes
[02:21.42]I feel like losing you, to you
[02:30.13]
[02:30.55]So I gaze in your eyes
[02:39.38]And I wonder, can you take me up
[02:47.62]Your hands that I'm under
[02:54.70]Come wake me up
[03:01.19]
[03:05.11]For a thousand days
[03:10.53]We could get carried away
[03:15.89]Are you in Are you in
[03:30.09]
[03:31.34]So I gaze in your eyes
[03:38.07]And I wonder can you take me up
[03:45.79]Your hands that I'm under
[03:52.83]Come wake
[03:55.58]So I gaze in your eyes
[04:01.68]And I wonder can you take me up
[04:14.46]
