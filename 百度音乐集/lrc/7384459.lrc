[00:01.44]Dear John
[00:03.19]Taylor Swift
[00:05.58]
[00:24.54]Long were the nights
[00:26.93]When my days once revolved around you
[00:36.58]Counting my footsteps
[00:39.66]Praying the floor won't fall through  again
[00:48.15]My mother accused me of losing my mind
[00:53.79]but I swore I was fine
[01:00.73]You paint me a blue sky
[01:03.59]And go back and turn it to rain
[01:11.48]And I lived in your chess game
[01:15.65]but you changed the rules every day
[01:24.86]Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
[01:33.78]Tonight
[01:36.29]Well I stopped picking up
[01:39.06]And this song is to let you know why
[01:45.13]
[01:47.40]Dear John
[01:51.84]I see it all now that you're gone
[01:58.01]Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
[02:03.67]The girl in the dress
[02:06.29]Cried the whole way home
[02:12.46]I should've known
[02:14.17]
[02:24.53]Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
[02:35.76]Maybe it's you and your sick
[02:39.44]Need to give love then take it away
[02:48.55]And you'll add my name to your long list
[02:53.71]Of traitors who don't understand
[03:00.24]And I'll look back and regret how I ignored
[03:05.18]When they said run as fast as you can
[03:12.30]Dear John
[03:15.17]I see it all now that you're gone
[03:22.33]Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
[03:28.04]The girl in the dress
[03:30.71]Cried the whole way home
[03:36.32]Dear John
[03:39.26]I see it all  now it was wrong
[03:46.38]Don't you think 19 is too young to be played
[03:51.89]By your dark twisted games  when I loved you so
[04:00.90]I should've known
[04:04.82]
[04:11.66]You are an expert at sorry
[04:15.01]and keeping lines blurry
[04:19.48]Never impressed by me acing your tests
[04:25.38]All the girls that you run dry
[04:28.28]with tired  lifeless eyes
[04:31.02]cause you burned them out
[04:37.55]But I took your matches before fire could catch me
[04:43.32]So don't look now
[04:49.51]I'm shining like fireworks over your sad  empty town
[05:05.97]
[05:18.35]Dear John
[05:21.55]I see it all now that you're gone
[05:28.86]Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
[05:34.64]The girl in the dress
[05:37.12]Cried the whole way home
[05:46.97]I see it all now that you're gone
[05:53.00]Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
[05:58.71]The girl in the dress wrote you a song
[06:07.45]You should've known
[06:12.41]You should've known
[06:18.17]
[06:22.67]Don't you think I was too young
[06:29.13]You should've known
[06:32.59]
