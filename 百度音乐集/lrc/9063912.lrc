[00:01.90]A fragile heart, was broken before
[00:09.36]I don't think it could endure
[00:12.79]Another pain
[00:16.08]But there's a voice from deep inside
[00:21.27]Of you
[00:23.77]That's calling out to make you realise
[00:30.21]That this new bond gives inspiration
[00:37.97]To all who feel no love appeal no more
[00:44.37]So how can I break this wall
[00:48.70]around you
[00:51.87]That's aiding our hearts to grow
[00:55.44]in pain
[00:58.46]So forget your past, and we can
[01:03.67]Dream tomorrow
[01:05.73]Save our hearts for care and
[01:09.18]Lovin too
[01:13.17]It's hard I know, but oh one things
[01:18.42]For sure
[01:20.17]Don't go and break this fragile heart
[01:26.60]A hurting mind in need of emotion
[01:34.24]I don't think I could endure
[01:37.33]Another pain
[01:40.80]But baby in you, I've found affection
[01:48.63]Affection I have never felt before
[01:54.89]So don't let your past
[01:59.19]Destroy what comes tomorrow
[02:02.63]Don't go and break my fragile heart
[02:09.08]With all this fire that burns
[02:13.40]Between us
[02:16.58]There's so much to lose, yet so much
[02:19.65]More to gain
[02:23.12]And if I could choose the world
[02:27.47]Around me
[02:30.80]The world to choose, would all
[02:33.47]Revolve around you
[02:37.20]So help me complete the game
[02:41.62]Inside me
[02:44.99]And help to mend my fragile heart
