[00:00.00]Shakira - Mon Amour
[00:14.00]
[00:20.80]I think you are living in denial
[00:24.29]Oh can't you see she's pretty wild?
[00:27.27]And every night I pray
[00:28.69]that you don't knock her up
[00:30.49]'Cause I still want to be
[00:31.75]the mother of your child
[00:33.38]
[00:34.00]They say "l'amour est ne a Paris"
[00:37.39]So she's planned a little trip to France
[00:40.75]while she's in anxious anticipation
[00:43.80]I really hope you have a horrible vacation
[00:47.03]
[00:47.41]And so you think of me when you arrive.
[00:50.58]Hope the french fleas eat you both alive.
[00:54.19]And your room smells
[00:55.52]And the toilet doesn't flush
[00:57.26]And locals treat you mean
[00:58.94]And the service takes too long
[01:00.66]'Cause I'm fragile
[01:02.55]and you broke my heart in two
[01:04.12]But you just smile
[01:05.46]Like it's all the same to you, to you
[01:10.03]But when you learn your lesson
[01:13.58]Come like a prodigal son
[01:16.88]Read the big sign at the airport
[01:20.06]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[01:23.48]And when you learn your lesson
[01:26.87]Come like a prodigal son
[01:30.13]Read the big sign at the airport
[01:33.27]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[01:36.91]
[01:40.82]Where did you get the ability?
[01:44.19]To make fakes promises to me
[01:47.27]You are exactly like
[01:48.97]a politician
[01:50.59]Need everyone's approval just to see
[01:52.73]if you are doing right.
[01:53.95]And I hope you both freeze
[01:55.71]under the Eiffel Tower
[01:57.14]So you end up throwing in the towel
[02:00.82]Hope you'll miss me
[02:02.47]And someday you're gonna see
[02:04.15]That I put my trust in you
[02:05.71]But you turned you back to me.
[02:07.39]'Cause I'm fragile
[02:09.21]and you broke my heart in two
[02:10.71]But you just smile
[02:12.39]Like it's all the same to you, to you
[02:16.66]But when you learn your lesson
[02:20.24]Come like a prodigal son
[02:23.53]Read the big sign at the airport
[02:26.68]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[02:30.16]And when you learn your lesson
[02:33.49]Come like a prodigal son
[02:36.79]Read the big sign at the airport
[02:39.89]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[02:43.69]
[03:06.98]And when you learn your lesson
[03:10.27]Come like a prodigal son
[03:13.56]Read the big sign at the airport
[03:16.63]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[03:20.37]And when you learn your lesson
[03:23.54]Come like a prodigal son
[03:26.84]Read the big sign at the airport
[03:29.86]Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
[03:33.62]
[03:36.13]Mon amour, mon amour...
