[00:15.41]Love wandered inside
[00:21.60]Stronger than you
[00:25.49]Stronger than I
[00:30.56]And now that it has begun
[00:37.25]We cannot turn back
[00:41.40]We can only turn into one
[00:47.43]I won’t ever be too far away to feel you
[00:54.92]And I won’t hesitate at all
[01:00.05]Whenever you call
[01:02.82]And I’ll always remeber
[01:06.52]The part of you so tender
[01:10.47]I’ll be the one to catch you fall
[01:15.39]Whenever you call
[01:25.17]And I’m truly inspired
[01:32.24]Finding my soul
[01:36.10]There in your eyes
[01:40.50]And you
[01:43.14]Have opened my heart
[01:46.90]And lifted me inside
[01:50.58]By showing me yourself
[01:53.57]Undisguised
[01:56.50]I won’t ever be too far away to feel you
[02:03.71]And I won’t hesitate at all
[02:08.33]Whenever you call
[02:11.16]And I’ll always remeber
[02:14.57]The part of you so tender
[02:18.30]I’ll be the one to catch you fall
[02:22.87]Whenever you call
[02:29.29](MC: Uuuuuh)
[02:33.20]And I will breathe for you each day
[02:37.20]Comfort you through all the pain
[02:40.63]Gently kiss your fears away
[02:48.09]You can turn to me and cry
[02:51.91]Always understand that I
[02:55.65]Give you all I am inside
[03:03.65]I won’t ever be too far away to feel you
[03:10.81]And I won’t hesitate at all
[03:15.39]Whenever you call
[03:18.55]I won’t ever be too far away to feel you
[03:25.44]And I won’t hesitate at all
[03:30.30]Whenever you call
[03:33.09]And I’ll always remeber
[03:36.71]The part of you so tender
[03:40.58]I’ll be the one to catch you fall
[03:45.07]Whenever you call
[03:56.59]Whenever you call
[04:09.01]Whenever you
[04:12.80]Call
