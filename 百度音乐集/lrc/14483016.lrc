<我要你的愛>
作曲：姚敏   作詞：姚敏　
# 我　我　我要你　我要你的　我要你的愛　你為什麼不走過來
我　我要　我要你　我要你的　我要你的愛　你為什麼不說出來
Listen to your mama and you never will regret it and if
anybody wonders you can tell them that I said it the
only thing I know is that I never can forget you I've
been longing for you baby ever since the day
I met you I got you where I want you and I'm never gonna let you
get away from me hear what I tell you
* I'm the man for you and so you better start to face it
If you ever loose my love you know you never can replace it
I think it's time for you to start to give me some loving carrying
a touch for you that's hotter than an oven It's time for you and me
to do a little tender loving baby hold me tight
and do what I tell you tight and do what I tell you
Repeat # *
我愛你我愛你
我　我要　我要你　我要你說　只要說聲愛
你為什麼不　為什麼不　為什麼不敢說愛
