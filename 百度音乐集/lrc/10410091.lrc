[00:02.00]
[00:19.53]Mark:
[00:20.78]If a picture paints a thousand words
[00:26.04]Then why can't I paint you?
[00:31.30]The words will never show
[00:36.50]You have come to know
[00:40.41]
[00:41.00]Shane:
[00:41.44]If a face can launch a thousand ships
[00:46.74]Then where am I to go?
[00:51.93]Coz no one holds my tune
[00:57.03]You're all that's left me too
[01:00.87]
[01:01.25]Mark:
[01:02.02]And when my love for life is running dry
[01:12.00]You come and pour yourself on me
[01:21.64]
[01:22.13]Nicky:
[01:22.73]If a man could be at two place at one time
[01:29.06]I'd be with you
[01:33.21]Tomorrow and today
[01:38.35]Beside you all the way
[01:42.22]
[01:42.85]Shane and Kian
[01:43.21]If the world should stop revolving stop spinning
[01:48.74]Slowly down to die
[01:53.87]I'd spend the end with you
[01:59.01]And when the world was through
[02:03.22]
[02:03.60]Mark
[02:03.97]And when the world and the stars would all go wild
[02:14.07]And you and I would simply fly away
[02:28.73]
