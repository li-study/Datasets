[00:22.51]Judas Priest
[00:44.51]Sin After Sin
[00:48.51]
[00:50.49]Grand canyons of space and time universal
[00:57.09]My mind is subjected to all
[01:02.60]
[01:04.42]Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl
[01:08.10]Hooks to my brain are well in
[01:11.39]Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl
[01:14.84]I know what I am, I'm Berlin

[02:29.23]Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
[02:36.29]Until I give out my last breath
[02:42.25]
[02:43.39]I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
[02:46.71]Hooks to my brain are well in
[02:50.28]I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
[02:53.64]I know what I am, I'm Berlin
