[00:00.49]
[00:02.64]Well don't you know I need a little indulgence?
[00:07.53]Listen to the hunter becoming hunted
[00:12.92]Every day there's a million advances
[00:17.91]Don't be too forceful, you'll ruin your chances
[00:22.49]Well don't you know that time is a broken glass
[00:26.20]That splinters against the wall?
[00:28.42]But the picture is coming back now baby,
[00:31.50]And I want to take it all
[00:33.58]Don't go making all these promises
[00:36.10]you know you cannot keep
[00:38.14]There's a time to play a king
[00:40.53]and a time to be the thief
[00:43.05]'Cause if you're making all these promises
[00:45.93]you know you cannot keep
[00:48.05]You know time will be the thief
[00:50.34]and your fallen king will end up alone
[00:54.78]
[00:57.25]So let you're body move a little bit closer
[01:02.35]Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone
[01:07.71]Don't you know that powerful thinking
[01:12.55]Can be a force you don't want to relinquish?
[01:17.15]Well don't you know that,
[01:18.81]They say that hanging on will justify the wait?
[01:23.09]But patience and elated wisdom
[01:26.22]don't share a common phrase
[01:28.24]Don't go making all these promises
[01:30.50]you know you cannot keep
[01:32.80]There's a time to play a king
[01:35.12]and a time to be the thief
[01:37.73]'Cause if you're making all these promises
[01:40.55]you know you cannot keep
[01:42.71]You know time will be the thief
[01:44.90]and your fallen king will end up alone
[01:49.71]
[01:53.82]Well, I'm only hanging on for what goes down
[01:58.63]I'm floating high and my feet don't touch the ground
[02:03.56]I'd take advantage but I can't see through this charade
[02:08.86]So don't you, don't go make it harder than hell
[02:13.59](Don't go making promises)
[02:15.87](Don't go making promises)
[02:17.97]'Cause when it comes down to the making
[02:20.01]You better be damned sure you can take it
[02:22.51]Hey baby
[02:23.76](Don't go making promises)
[02:25.64](Don't go making promises)
[02:28.51]
[02:32.67](oh baby,don't you know baby)
[02:57.75][02:37.75]Well don't go making all these promises
[03:00.13][02:40.37]you know you cannot keep
[03:02.26][02:42.46]There's a time to play a king
[03:04.39][02:44.68]and a time to be a thief
[03:07.19][02:47.37]'Cause if your making all these promises
[03:10.20][02:50.17]you know you cannot keep
[03:12.24][02:52.37]You know time will be the thief
[02:54.61]and your fallen king will end up alone
[03:14.40]and your fallen king will end up...
[03:17.44]A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool
[03:22.34]Oh baby, 'cause I told you baby
[03:27.12]
