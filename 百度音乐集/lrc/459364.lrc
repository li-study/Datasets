[00:00.00]Azure Ray: Look To Me
[00:04.11]Look To Me
[00:09.29]Lay your head in my lap
[00:18.86]Let the sound of my laught comfort you now here in the cold
[00:29.00]Your face gets wet as the drink slips from my hand
[00:38.98]The faster i drive the harder i cry don’t worry i’ll get us there
[00:48.65]And i look down at you
[00:53.50]You look up at me
[00:59.36]We’re a real fucked up family
[01:14.22]We make it home this place is a mess
[01:23.90]The smell of cologne mixed with all that we own
[01:28.97]Not much i must confess
[01:33.97]I hold your hand as you slip from me
[01:43.87]As i watch your breath i say to myself one day this will all end
[01:53.44]And i look at you
[01:58.73]You look at me
[02:03.87]We’re a real fucked up family
[02:36.86]All night i feel it inside
[02:53.75]But i know you’re right as i begin to pack
[03:03.59]Without raising your eyes i hear you sigh oh you’ll be back
[03:13.36]Because i look to you and you look to me
[03:23.45]We’re a real fucked up family
