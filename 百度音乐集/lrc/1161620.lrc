[00:19.54]Grew up in a small town
[00:21.67]And when the rain would fall down
[00:23.90]I just stared out my window
[00:28.42]Dreaming of a could-be
[00:30.60]And if I'd end up happy
[00:32.56]I would pray I would pray
[00:37.59]Trying not to reach out
[00:39.50]But when I'd try to speak out
[00:41.83]Felt like no one could hear me
[00:46.27]Wanted to belong here
[00:48.38]But something felt so wrong here
[00:50.46]So I pray I would pray
[00:54.84]I could breakaway
[01:01.56]I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly

[01:10.85]I'll make a wish
[01:12.04]Take a chance
[01:13.05]Make a change
[01:14.53]And breakaway
[01:19.82]Out of the darkness and into the sun
[01:23.78]But I won't forget all the ones that I loved

[01:31.01]Make a change
[01:32.60]And breakaway

[01:47.29]Wanna feel the warm breeze

[01:56.08]Get onboard a fast train
[01:58.27]Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
[02:04.21]And breakaway

[02:42.96]And breakaway
[02:47.76]Buildings with a hundred floors
[02:49.94]Swinging around wild indoors

[02:56.52]Gotta keep moving on, moving on
[02:59.63]Fly away, breakaway
[03:05.53]I'll spread my wings
[03:07.44]And I'll learn how to fly
[03:09.74]Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
[03:14.34]I gotta take a risk
[03:15.86]Take chance
[03:16.86]Make a change
[03:18.38]And breakaway
[03:23.23]Out of the darkness and into the sun
[03:27.42]But I won't forget the place I come from
