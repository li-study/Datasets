[00:00.00]David Cook - Fade Into Me
[00:02.92]
[00:11.01]All I feel now,
[00:13.06]Is the weight of the day
[00:15.94]
[00:19.69]I need you with me
[00:22.73]To push it away
[00:26.41]
[00:28.28]We disappeared into each other
[00:33.95]Colors appeared and bleed into one
[00:38.92]
[00:40.95]Fade into me, fade into you,
[00:45.58]Two of us melting together
[00:49.59]until we become something new,
[00:52.84]We can't escape,
[00:55.16]And watch the world chasing to find us,
[00:59.16]Both of us hidden from view,
[01:02.70]If you, fade into me, fade into me.
[01:12.28]
[01:17.33]When I'm broken,
[01:18.96]You're the one thing I need,
[01:22.13]
[01:25.89]Like an ocean,
[01:28.86]Feel you crash over me,
[01:31.83]
[01:34.27]We disappeared into each other,
[01:39.92]Colors appeared and bleed into one,
[01:44.20]
[01:47.20]Fade into me, fade into you
[01:51.21]Two of us melting together
[01:55.44]until we become something new
[01:58.96]We can't escape
[02:01.29]And watch the world chasing to find us,
[02:05.06]Both of us hidden from view,
[02:08.59]If you, fade into me
[02:13.32]
[02:13.82]Not gonna fall in
[02:18.13]Drown in the moment with me
[02:23.20]Sinking till we start to breathe
[02:30.35]
[02:35.48]Fade into me, fade into you,
[02:39.68]Two of us melting together
[02:43.43]until we become something new,
[02:47.00]We can't escape,
[02:49.56]And watch the world chasing to find us,
[02:53.28]
[02:55.04]Fade into me, fade into you,
[02:59.20]Two of us melting together
[03:02.36]until we become something new,
[03:05.95]We can't escape,
[03:08.69]And watch the world chasing to find us,
[03:12.32]Both of us hidden from view,
[03:15.91]
[03:20.57]If you, fade into me.
[03:29.16]Fade into me.
[03:35.01]
[03:39.67]Fade into me.
[03:43.58]
