[00:02.89]
[00:05.83]On a Monday, I am waiting
[00:08.30]Tuesday, I am fading
[00:11.02]And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
[00:16.48]Then the phone rings, I hear you
[00:19.10]And the darkness is a clear view
[00:21.85]Cuz you've come to rescue me
[00:26.59]
[00:27.96]Fall... With you, I fall so fast
[00:33.04]I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts
[00:38.58]
[00:38.86][Chorus:]
[00:39.22]Ohhhhh
[00:41.66]It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
[00:46.86]I like the way that feels
[00:49.75]Ohhhhh
[00:52.66]It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself
[00:57.85]I love how you can tell
[01:00.55]All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
[01:05.82]All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
[01:11.66]
[01:12.00]I am moody, messy
[01:16.88]I get restless, and it's senseless
[01:17.48]How you never seem to care
[01:21.83]
[01:22.65]when i am angry for a reason
[01:25.43]when i am happy to a mission
[01:28.14]and you want stop till i'm there
[01:34.25]
[01:34.50]Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast
[01:39.32]Well, I hit that bottom
[01:40.92]Crash, you're all I have
[01:44.62]
[01:45.01][Chorus:]
[01:45.34]Ohhhhh
[01:47.71]It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
[01:52.85]I like the way that feels
[01:56.05]Ohhhhh
[01:58.42]It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself
[02:04.12]I love how you can tell
[02:06.79]All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
[02:13.16]
[02:14.29]How do you know everything I'm about to say?
[02:19.72]Am I that obvious?
[02:22.21]And if it's written on my face...
[02:25.80]I hope it never goes away... yeah
[02:31.80]
[02:34.33]On a Monday, I am waiting
[02:36.69]And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...
[02:41.70]So I can breathe
[02:45.21]
[02:45.53][Chorus:]
[02:45.87]Ohhhhh
[02:47.90]It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
