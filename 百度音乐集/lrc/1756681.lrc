[00:00.00]Bonfires dot the rolling hillsides
[00:20.25]Figures dance around and around
[00:20.86]To drums that pulse out echoes of darkness
[00:21.13]Moving to the pagan sound
[00:21.52]
[00:21.84]Somewhere in a hidden memory
[00:22.15]Images flort before my eyes
[00:22.38]Of fragrant nights of straw and of bonfires
[00:22.61]And dancing till the next sunrise
[00:22.95]
[00:23.17]CHORUS
[00:23.71]I can see the lights in a distance
[00:23.93]Trembling in thedark cloak of night
[00:24.16]Candles and lanterns are dancing ,dancing
[00:24.39]A waltz on all souls night
[00:24.57]
[00:24.75]Figures of cornstalks bend in the shadows
[00:24.94]Held up tall as the flames leqp high
[00:25.14]The green knight holds the holly bush
[00:25.33]To mark where the old year passes by
[00:25.55]
[00:25.73]CHORUS
[00:25.92]Bonfires dot the rolling hillsides
[00:26.10]Figures dance around and around
[00:26.28]To drums that pulse out echoes of darkness
[00:26.46]And moving toward the pagan sound
[00:26.60]
[00:26.87]Standing on the bridge that crosses
[00:27.05]The river that goes out to the sea
[00:27.28]The wind is full of a thousand voices
[00:27.46]They pass by the bridge and me
