[00:14.45]You would say anything
[00:19.73]And you would try anything
[00:26.42]To escape your meaningless
[00:32.57]And your insignificance
[00:39.55]You're uncontrollable
[00:45.67]And we are unlovable
[00:52.04]And I don't want you to think that I care
[00:58.73]I never would, I never could again

[01:13.55]Why be such a monster
[01:19.17]You burn me from a distance
[01:25.25]Your brain needs some assistance
[01:30.74]But I'll still take all the blame

[02:00.42]I didn't realize I was talking to the living dead
[02:05.54]And I dont want you to think that I care
[02:11.67]I never would, I never could again

[02:54.75]You would say anything
[03:01.09]And you would try anything
[03:07.22]To escape your meaningless
[03:13.20]And your insignificance
