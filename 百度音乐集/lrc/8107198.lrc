[03:15.58][00:16.63]Who kicked a hole in the sky
[03:18.78][00:20.18]so the heavens would cry over me
[03:28.40][00:29.59]Who stole the soul from the sun
[03:31.68][00:32.95]in a world come undone at the seams
[04:32.83][04:19.67][04:00.11][03:53.54][03:47.28][03:40.87][00:48.46][00:41.82]Let there be love
[02:48.49][00:52.41]
[00:55.52]I hope the weather is calm
[00:58.43]as you sail up your heavenly stream
[01:07.84]Suspended clear in the sky
[01:11.29]are the words that we sing in our dreams
[04:25.99][04:13.31][04:06.54][01:39.74][01:33.33][01:26.78][01:20.48]Let there be love
[01:46.41]
[01:47.94]Come on baby blue
[01:53.18]Shake up your tired eyes
[01:56.67]the world is waitin for you
[02:00.26]May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
[02:09.81]
[02:12.99]But if it makes you happy
[02:17.29]Keep on clapping
[02:20.39]Just rememeber i'll be by your side
[02:25.99]And if you dont let go
[02:30.10]Its gonna pass you by
