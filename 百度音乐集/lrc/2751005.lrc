[00:13.11]I know a freaky young lady
[00:15.33]Name of Cocaine Katie
[00:16.63]She makes my temperature freeze
[00:19.40]She′s got a blood red powder
[00:20.88]When she gives a shout
[00:22.36]She′ll bring you to your knees
[00:24.95]Well, we were being clever playing God games forever
[00:28.46]She said she only meant to please
[00:30.86]But I′m someone′s brother, got a father and a mother
[00:34.56]You know I′m going to have to leave
[00:36.96]South of the border
[00:41.59]I think you oughta
[00:43.07]South of the border
[00:47.50]I think you oughta
[00:49.17]′cos you know you′re gonna have to leave
[00:56.01]To a place where you can breahte
[01:00.63]And you know there′s no reprieve
[01:07.47]
[01:19.30]There′ll be tears on leaving
[01:21.15]But there won′t be no grieving
[01:22.63]′cos a city soon forgets
[01:25.03]To me it′s magic
[01:27.07]To the landlord it′s tragic
[01:28.73]He′s got another room let
[01:30.77]There′ll be the same old faces in the same old places
[01:34.65]Where my youth was well misspent
[01:37.05]But I tow the line and move the time
[01:40.57]To a town called ′No Regrets′
[01:42.97]South of the border
[01:47.41]I think you oughta
[01:49.26]South of the border
[01:53.32]I think you oughta
[01:54.99]′cos you know you′re gonna have to leave
[02:00.16]To a place where you can breathe
[02:07.01]And you know there′s no reprieve
[02:13.48]
[03:19.67]′cos you know you′re gonna have to leave
[03:25.21]To a place where you can breathe
[03:31.31]And you know there′s no reprieve
[03:39.82]
