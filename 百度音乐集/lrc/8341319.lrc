[00:05.47]Carpenters
[00:09.98]
[00:19.44]I have always been a dreamer,
[00:24.52]followed vision of my own.
[00:29.84]I was born to belong to the lines of a song
[00:35.74]and make them my home.
[00:39.58]
[00:40.54]I believe in happy endings,
[00:45.96]though I've only known a few.
[00:51.09]For as rare as they are like a bright falling star,
[00:56.81]I found one in you.
[01:01.24]
[01:03.68]Sometimes all the world can seem so friendless,
[01:10.76]and the road ahead so endless,
[01:16.53]and the dream so far away.
[01:22.54]Sometimes.
[01:25.10]Sometimes when I'm almost to surrender,
[01:32.57]and I stop and I remember
[01:37.82]I have you to save my day.
[01:44.16]
[01:47.66]Often my imagination has me reaching out too far.
[01:58.46]When I fell, you were there
[02:01.13]with your hand in the air,
[02:04.52]you knew from the start.
[02:09.99]
[02:11.38]Sometimes after all you've done to save me,
[02:18.89]through the love you freely gave me,
[02:24.30]ev'ry step along the way.
[02:30.31]Sometimes.
[02:33.10]Sometimes people ask what keeps me goin',
[02:40.27]and in truth it come from knowin'
[02:45.59]I have you to save my day.
[02:51.77]
[02:54.33]Sometimes feeling helpless when I held you,
[03:01.52]wishing words would come to tell you
[03:07.12]I have you to save my day.
[03:15.17]
