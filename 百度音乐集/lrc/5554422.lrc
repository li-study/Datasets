[00:16.19]I see dark clouds out my window
[00:21.44]I know the storm is coming any minute
[00:29.87]And the thunder just confirms my fears
[00:36.58]And I know the tears are in there
[00:44.23]I'll be crying unable to stop
[00:50.34]Look here comes the very first drop
[00:58.66]Cuz every time it rains
[01:02.62]I fall to pieces
[01:06.38]So many memories the rain releases
[01:11.56]I feel you... I taste you
[01:15.46]I canno forget
[01:19.30]Every time it rains... I get wet
[01:34.24]Darling I am still in love with you
[01:41.21]As time passes by it just intensifies
[01:48.41]I know I'll never be with you again
[01:53.68]I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes
[02:03.00]I'll be trying unable to stop
[02:10.52]Look here comes the very first drop
[02:17.74]Cuz every time it rains
[02:21.90]I fall to pieces
[02:25.08]So many memories the rain releases

[02:34.17]I cannot forget
[02:37.55]Every time it rains... I get wet
[03:00.02]On sunny days I'm all right
[03:03.53]I walk in the light
[03:07.88]And i try not to think about
[03:11.40]The love I live without
[03:15.53]But every time it rains
[03:18.74]I fall to pieces
[03:22.48]So many memories the rain releases
[03:27.54]I feel you... I taste you
