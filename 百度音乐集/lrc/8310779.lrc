[00:14.09]When marimba rhythms start to play
[00:17.31]Dance with me, make me sway
[00:21.55]Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
[00:24.84]Hold me close, sway me more
[00:28.68]
[00:29.51]Like a flower bending in the breeze
[00:32.54]Bend with me, sway with ease
[00:36.63]When we dance you have a way with me
[00:40.12]Stay with me, sway with me
[00:44.05]
[00:44.73]Other dancers may be on the floor
[00:48.30]Dear, but my eyes will see only you
[00:52.03]Only you have that magic technique
[00:55.97]When we sway I go weak
[00:59.53]
[01:00.05]I can hear the sounds of violins
[01:03.17]Long before it begins
[01:07.28]Make me thrill as only you know how
[01:10.68]Sway me smooth, sway me now
[01:14.51]
[01:16.61]Sway me, take me
[01:20.30]Thrill me, hold me
[01:24.00]Bend me, ease me
[01:28.20]You have a way with me
[01:30.04]
[01:45.64]Sway (sway)
[01:46.86]
[02:01.00]Other dancers may be on the floor
[02:04.60]Dear, but my eyes will see only you
[02:08.54]Only you have that magic technique
[02:12.20]When we sway I go weak
[02:17.03]I go weak
[02:19.81]
[02:20.24]I can hear the sounds of violins
[02:23.17]Long before it begins
[02:27.68]Make me thrill as only you know how
[02:30.70]Sway me smooth, sway me now
[02:35.33]Make me thrill as only you know how
[02:38.58]Sway me smooth, sway me now
[02:42.86]Make me thrill as only you know how
[02:45.87]Sway me smooth, sway me now
[02:50.86]Sway me
[02:54.53]Sway me
[02:58.30]Sway me now
[03:03.26]
