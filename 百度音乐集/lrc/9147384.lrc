[00:00.65]Doesn't Mean Anything
[00:01.37]Alicia Keys
[00:04.51]
[00:19.20]Used to dream about being a millionaire
[00:22.17]Without a care
[00:23.91]But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
[00:27.25]Cause it's over
[00:30.26]That just won't be fair
[00:35.91]Darling
[00:37.11]
[00:37.78]Rather be a poor woman living on the street
[00:40.47]No food to eat
[00:42.38]Cause I don't want nobody if I have it cry
[00:45.55]Cause it's over when you say goodbye
[00:52.82]
[00:55.10]All at once
[00:59.12]I had it all
[01:03.07]But it doesn't mean anything
[01:08.23]Now that you're gone
[01:13.24]From above
[01:17.21]Seems I had it all
[01:21.62]But it doesn't mean anything
[01:26.96]Since you're gone
[01:32.63]
[01:33.30]Now I see myself through different eyes
[01:36.03]It's no surprise
[01:37.75]Being alone would make you realize
[01:40.78]When it's over
[01:44.35]All in love is fair
[01:47.05]I shoulda been there,
[01:47.96]I should been there,
[01:49.13]I shoulda shoulda
[01:50.30]
[01:50.34]All at once
[01:54.35]I had it all
[01:58.49]But it doesn't mean anything
[02:03.59]Now that you're gone
[02:08.56]From above
[02:12.64]Seems I had it all
[02:17.41]But it doesn't mean anything
[02:22.31]Since you're gone
[02:27.83]
[02:28.46]I know I push you away
[02:30.55]What can I do that will say how I love
[02:37.51]Take these material things
[02:39.79]They don't mean nothing
[02:41.75]It's you that I want
[02:45.51]
[02:46.00]All at once
[02:49.80]I had it all
[02:53.83]But it doesn't mean anything
[02:58.96]Now that you're gone
[03:03.96]From above
[03:07.94]Seems I had it all
[03:12.35]But it doesn't mean anything
[03:17.70]Since you're gone
[03:20.07](I shoulda been there
[03:21.10]I should been there
[03:22.29]I shoulda shoulda)
[03:23.60]
[03:22.62]All at once
[03:25.98]I had it all
[03:30.88]But it doesn't mean anything
[03:35.86]Now that you're gone
[03:40.88]From above
[03:44.82]Seems I had it all
[03:49.33]But it doesn't mean anything.
