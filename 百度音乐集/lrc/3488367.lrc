[00:02]SOMEBODY
[00:08]by Depeche Mode
[00:11]WRITTEN BY MARTIN L. GORE
[00:19]I want somebody to share
[00:24]Share the rest of my life
[00:27]Share my innermost thoughts
[00:30]Know my intimate details
[00:33]Someone who'll stand by my side
[00:36]And give me support
[00:40]And in return
[00:42]She'll get my support
[00:45]She will listen to me
[00:49]When I want to speak
[00:51]About the world we live in
[00:55]And life in general
[00:58]Though my views may be wrong
[01:00]They may even be perverted
[01:04]She will hear me out
[01:07]And won't easily be converted
[01:10]To my way of thinking
[01:14]In fact she'll often disagree
[01:16]But at the end of it all
[01:20]She will understand me
[01:24]
[01:52]I want somebody who cares
[01:56]For me passionately
[02:00]With every thought and with every breath
[02:05]Someone who'll help me see things
[02:08]In a different light
[02:11]All the things I detest
[02:14]I will almost like
[02:17]I don't want to be tied
[02:21]To anyone's strings
[02:24]I'm carefully trying to steer clear
[02:27]Of those things
[02:31]But when I'm asleep
[02:33]I want somebody
[02:36]Who will put their arms around me
[02:39]And kiss me tenderly
[02:42]And things like this
[02:46]Make me sick
[02:48]In a case like this
[02:51]I'll get away with it
