[00:32.80]Where have all the good men gone
[00:35.30]And where are all the gods?
[00:38.86]Where's the street-wise Hercules
[00:41.71]To fight the rising odds?
[00:45.46]Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
[00:52.33]Late at night toss and turn and dream of what I need
[00:57.84]I need a hero
[01:00.14]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[01:04.48]He's gotta be strong
[01:05.88]And he's gotta be fast
[01:07.45]And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
[01:10.73]I need a hero
[01:13.07]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
[01:17.09]He's gotta be sure
[01:18.97]And it's gotta be soon
[01:20.33]And he's gotta be larger than life
[01:23.50]Somewhere after midnight
[01:25.58]
[01:39.75]In my wildest fantasy
[01:43.52]Somewhere just beyond my reach
[01:46.10]There's someone reaching back for me
[01:50.08]Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
[01:56.56]It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet
[02:03.90]I need a hero
[02:06.17]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[02:10.62]He's gotta be strong
[02:11.83]And he's gotta be fast
[02:13.55]And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
[02:16.58]I need a hero
[02:18.96]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
[02:23.10]He's gotta be sure
[02:24.78]And it's gotta be soon
[02:26.34]And he's gotta be larger than life
[02:30.92]I need a hero
[02:33.53]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[02:37.07]
[02:51.28]Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
[02:54.42]Out where the lightning splits the sea
[02:57.63]I would swear that there's someone somewhere
[03:00.48]Watching me
[03:04.11]Through the wind and the chill and the rain
[03:07.27]And the storm and the flood
[03:10.47]I can feel his approach
[03:12.04]Like the fire in my blood
[03:14.31]
[03:24.24]I need a hero
[03:26.62]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[03:30.81]He's gotta be strong
[03:32.20]And he's gotta be fast
[03:33.92]And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
[03:36.93]I need a hero
[03:39.39]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
[03:43.45]He's gotta be sure
[03:45.05]And it's gotta be soon
[03:46.73]And he's gotta be larger than life
[03:49.70]I need a hero
[03:52.36]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[03:56.42]He's gotta be strong
[03:58.09]And he's gotta be fast
[03:59.66]And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
[04:02.78]I need a hero
[04:05.24]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
[04:09.11]He's gotta be sure
[04:10.94]And it's gotta be soon
[04:12.54]And he's gotta be larger than life
[04:15.28]
