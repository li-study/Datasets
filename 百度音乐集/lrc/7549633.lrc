[00:05.00]I got my first real six-string
[00:08.00]Bought it at the five-and-dime
[00:12.00]Played it till my fingers bled
[00:15.00]It was the summer of '69
[00:18.00]Me and some guys from school
[00:22.00]Had a band and we tried real hard
[00:25.00]Jimmy quit and Jody got married
[00:29.00]I shoulda known we'd never get far
[00:33.00]Oh when I look back now
[00:36.00]That summer seemed to last forever
[00:39.00]And if I had the choice
[00:43.00]Yeah - I'd always wanna be there
[00:46.00]Those were the best days of my life
[00:57.00]Ain't no use in complainin'
[01:00.00]When you got a job to do
[01:03.00]Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
[01:08.00]And that's when I met you
[01:10.00]Standin' on your mama's porch
[01:14.00]You told me that you'd wait forever
[01:17.00]Oh and when you held my hand
[01:21.00]I knew that it was now or never
[01:24.00]Those were the best days of my life
[01:30.00]Oh yeah
[01:33.00]Back in the summer of '69
[01:37.00]Ohhh
[01:41.00]Man we were killin' time
[01:44.00]We were young and restless
[01:46.00]We needed to unwind
[01:49.00]I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no
[01:58.00]Yeah
[02:10.00]And now the times are changin'
[02:13.00]Look at everything that's come and gone
[02:16.00]Sometimes when I play that old six-string
[02:20.00]I think about ya wonder what went wrong
[02:23.00]Standin' on your mama's porch
[02:26.00]You told me that it'd last forever
[02:30.00]Oh and when you held my hand
[02:33.00]I knew that it was now or never
[02:37.00]Those were the best days of my life
