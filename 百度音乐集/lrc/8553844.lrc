[00:05.44]I will break into your thoughts
[00:11.45]With what's written on my heart
[00:17.88]I will break, break
[00:30.55]I'm so sick, infected with
[00:34.19]Where I live
[00:35.78]Let me live without this
[00:39.15]Empty bliss, selfishness
[00:42.66]I'm so sick
[00:45.73]I'm so sick
[00:49.62]If you want more of this
[00:55.13]We can push out, sell out, die out
[01:01.61]So you'll shut up
[01:04.58]And stay sleeping
[01:07.77]With my screaming in your itching ears
[01:14.15]I'm so sick, infected with
[01:17.82]Where I live
[01:19.69]Let me live without this
[01:22.99]Empty bliss, selfishness
[01:26.25]I'm so sick
[01:29.40]I'm so sick
[01:33.74]Hear it, I'm screaming it
[01:38.66]You're heeding to it now
[01:45.96]Hear it, I'm screaming it
[01:51.43]You tremble at this sound
[01:58.66]You sink into my clothes
[02:04.65]This invasion makes me feel
[02:08.01]Worthless, hopeless, sick
[02:10.64]I'm so sick, infected with
[02:14.03]Where I live
[02:15.61]Let me live without this
[02:18.89]Empty bliss, selfishness
[02:22.63]I'm so, I'm so sick
[02:29.75]I'm so sick, infected with
[02:32.93]Where I live
[02:34.58]Let me live without this
[02:37.72]Empty bliss, selfishness
[02:41.64]I'm so (I'm so)
[02:44.59]I'm so sick (I'm so sick)
[02:47.89]I'm so (I'm so)
[02:50.37]I'm so sick (I'm so sick)
