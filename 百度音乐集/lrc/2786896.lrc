[00:11.20]Those school girl of telling tales
[00:18.74]And biting nails gone
[00:25.65]But in my mind
[00:30.37]I know they will still live on and on
[00:39.99]But how do you take someone who has taken you
[00:44.92]From crayons to perfume
[00:49.60]It isn't easy but I'll try
[00:57.71]If you wanted the sky I'd write across the sky in letters
[01:05.23]That would soar a thousand feet high
[01:10.31]To sir with love
[01:18.54]The time has come for closing books
[01:25.90]And long last looks must end
[01:32.92]And as I leave
[01:37.58]I know that I am leaving my best friend
[01:47.27]A friend who taught me right from wrong
[01:50.93]And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
[01:56.54]What what can I give you in return
[02:05.03]If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
[02:10.10]But I would rather you let me give my heart
[02:17.43]to sir with love
