[00:06.46]
[00:08.41]Couldn't move a mountain but, what if
[00:14.35]Couldn't be an angel nor a goddess
[00:20.52]There's so many stories we'd loVE to believe
[00:26.56]But all I ever can be is me
[00:33.27]There's a devil inside us all
[00:39.11]But I believe in the beautiful
[00:42.92]
[00:45.04]We can't change today
[00:47.78]Undo yesterday
[00:51.47]Make it go away
[00:53.84]But what if
[00:57.23]When tommorow comes
[01:00.42]We could be the ones
[01:03.29]Who make miracles
[01:05.81]What if
[01:07.76]
[01:12.36]Saw you on the news today, crying
[01:18.32]I just wanna turn you off, keep denying
[01:24.50]Waiting for a wind to change to pull me right in
[01:30.65]And while I'm waiting you're under my skin
[01:35.19]
[01:36.63]We can't change today
[01:39.07]Undo yesterday
[01:42.72]Make it go away
[01:46.12]But what if
[01:48.89]When tommorow comes
[01:51.96]We could be the ones
[01:55.09]Who make miracles
[01:57.97]What if
[02:01.76]There's a devil inside us all
[02:06.99]I still believe in the beautiful
[02:16.46](what if)

[02:39.37]We can't change today
[02:42.36]Undo yesterday
[02:45.39]Make it go away
[02:48.50]But what if
[02:51.43]When tommorow comes
[02:54.74]We could be the last
[02:57.69]Who make miracles
[03:00.33]What if
[03:02.92]
[03:03.81]We can't change today
[03:06.47]Undo yesterday
[03:09.55]Make it go away
[03:12.72]But what if
[03:16.12]When tommorow comes
[03:18.92]We could be the last
[03:22.20]Who make miracles
[03:24.81]What if
[03:28.75]We can't change today
[03:31.74]Undo yesterday
[03:34.90]Make it go away
[03:37.33]But what if
[03:41.18]Couldn't save the world today...
[03:45.66]But what if...
