[03:55.28][03:25.59][03:14.54][03:09.85][02:05.32][01:59.91][01:35.37][01:06.29][01:00.07][00:16.56]
[00:31.01]So we're different colours
[00:33.02]And we're different creeds
[00:34.75]And different people have different needs
[00:38.28]It's obvious you hate me
[00:40.03]Though I've done nothing wrong
[00:41.83]I never even met you so what could I have done
[03:03.17][02:56.61][00:52.77][00:45.73]I can't understand
[03:04.99][02:58.06][00:54.54][00:47.66]What makes a man
[03:06.63][02:59.70][00:56.18][00:49.38]Hates another man
[03:08.51][03:01.43][02:02.41][01:57.16][00:57.98][00:51.06]Help me understand
[03:49.19][03:42.30][03:19.59][03:12.71][02:29.43][02:22.29][01:30.25][01:23.10]So why should it be
[03:51.35][03:44.46][03:21.96][02:31.54][02:24.46][01:32.26][01:25.23]You and I should get along so awfully
[02:41.37]Now you're punching
[02:42.66]And you're kicking
[02:43.44]And you're shouting at me
[02:45.45]I'm relying on your common decency
[02:48.57]So far it hasn't surfaced
[02:50.46]But I'm sure it exists
[02:51.93]It just takes a while
[02:53.13]To travel from your head to your fist
