[00:24.26]Last night
[00:25.53]I had a dream about you
[00:28.04]In this dream
[00:29.39]I'm dancing right beside you
[00:31.82]And it looked
[00:33.25]like everyone was having fun
[00:35.68]the kind of feeling
[00:37.10]I've waited so long
[00:39.55]Don't stop
[00:40.87]come a little closer
[00:43.27]As we jam
[00:44.81]the rythm gets stronger
[00:47.18]There's nothing wrong
[00:48.70]with just a little little fun
[00:51.17]We were dancing
[00:52.59]all night long
[00:54.86]The time is right
[00:56.51]to put my arms around you
[00:58.69]You're feeling right
[01:00.27]You wrap your arms around too
[01:02.51]But suddenly
[01:04.53]I feel the shining sun
[01:06.48]Before I knew it
[01:07.85]this dream was all gone
[01:10.22]Ooh
[01:12.28]I don't know what to do
[01:16.09]About this dream and you
[01:19.90]I wish this dream comes true
[01:22.34]
[01:25.39]Ooh
[01:27.70]I don't know what to do
[01:31.50]About this dream and you
[01:35.33]We'll make this dream come true
[01:42.46]
