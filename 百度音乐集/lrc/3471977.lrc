[00:08.18]
[00:12.94]Though you and I both know
[00:16.38]It's only the warm glow of wine
[00:21.45]
[00:26.05]That's got you to feeling this way
[00:31.35]But I don't care,
[00:33.96]I want you to stay
[00:38.41]Just hold me and tell me
[00:41.76]You'll be here to love me today

[02:06.90]The moon's come and gone
[02:09.63]But a few stars hang on on to the sky
[02:14.97]
[02:19.47]The wind's runnin' free
[02:22.38]But it ain't up to me ask why
[02:28.57]
[02:32.10]The poets are demanding their pay
[02:38.29]They've left me with nothin' to say
[02:44.68]'cept hold me and tell me
[02:48.18]You'll be here to love me today
[02:53.73]
[03:10.08][02:57.45]Just hold me and tell me
[03:13.43][03:00.83]You'll be here to love me today
