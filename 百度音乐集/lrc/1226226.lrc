[00:26.00]Hey fellas, have you heard the news? You know that Annie's back in town?
[00:30.75]It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down.
[00:35.66]Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago,
[00:40.72]But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows.
[00:46.21]
[01:08.72]Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you.
[01:13.55]The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue.
[01:18.71]Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love;
[01:23.67]But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above.
[01:28.33]
[01:32.03]People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat,
[01:36.85]I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at.
[01:41.78]One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do,
[01:46.67]It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you.
[01:55.17]I try to make love but it ain't no use.
[01:58.25]
[03:41.52]Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved;
[03:46.37]Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried.
[03:51.27]Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way;
[03:56.14]Go away, Heartbreaker.
