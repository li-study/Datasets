[00:07.99]Celtic Woman
[00:44.90]
[01:46.16]High is the moon tonight
[01:52.28]Hiding its guiding light
[01:54.46]High
[01:56.73]
[01:57.56]Heaven and earth do sleep
[02:00.26]Still in the dark so deep
[02:03.19]I will the darkness sweep
[02:05.68]
[02:11.18]I will the moon to flight
[02:13.73]I will the heavens bright
[02:16.46]I will the earth delight
[02:19.34]
[02:21.78]Open your eyes with me
[02:24.10]See paradise with me
[02:26.83]Awake and arise with me
[02:29.36]
[02:39.82]I am the dawn, I'm the new day begun
[02:44.39]I bring you the morning, I bring you the sun
[02:49.79]I hold back the night and I open the skies
[02:54.85]I give light to the world, I give sight to your eyes
[02:59.49]
[02:59.95]From the first of all time, until time is undone
[03:04.98]Forever and ever and ever and ever
[03:10.08]And I am the dawn and the sky and the sun
[03:15.21]I am one with the One, and I am the dawn
[03:21.25]
[04:44.41]I am the sky and the dawn and the sun
[04:52.13]I am the sky and the new day begun
[05:00.25]I am the sky and the dawn and the sun
[05:10.74]
[05:13.76]The end
