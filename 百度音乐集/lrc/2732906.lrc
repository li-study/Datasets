[00:12.64]Just because I'm losing
[00:16.81]Doesn't mean I'm lost
[00:22.76]Doesn't mean I'll stop
[00:28.62]Doesn't mean I would cross
[00:31.74]
[00:36.54]Just because I'm hurting
[00:40.47]Doesn't mean I'm hurt
[00:46.32]Doesn't mean I didn't get
[00:49.61]What I deserved
[00:52.60]No better and no worse
[00:55.49]
[00:58.66]I just got lost
[01:03.90]Every river that I tried to cross
[01:11.10]Every door I ever tried was locked
[01:16.57]Ohhh and I'm...
[01:20.43]Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
[01:25.20]
[01:29.50]You might be a big fish
[01:33.40]In a little pond
[01:39.04]Doesn't mean you've won
[01:42.55]'Cause along may come
[01:45.53]A bigger one
[01:48.34]
[01:51.27]And you'll be lost
[01:56.38]Every river that you tried to cross
[02:03.56]Every gun you ever held went off
[02:08.92]Ohhh and I'm...
[02:12.84]Just waiting until the firing stopped
[02:20.44]Ohhh and I'm...
[02:24.30]Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
[02:31.73]
[02:34.05](amazing piano solo)
[02:56.40]Ohhh and I'm...
[03:00.13]Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
[03:08.06]Ohhh and I'm...
[03:12.75]Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
