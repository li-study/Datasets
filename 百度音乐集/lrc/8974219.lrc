[00:02.47]Your Heart Will Lead You Home
[00:09.78]Kenny Loggins
[00:11.67]
[00:53.16]sunny days and starry nights
[00:56.39]and lazy afternoons
[00:59.65]you're countin' castles in the clouds
[01:03.09]and hummin' little tunes
[01:06.53]but somehow, right before your eyes
[01:09.95]the summer fades away
[01:12.80]everything is different
[01:16.24]and everything has changed
[01:18.13]
[01:19.97]if you feel lost and on your own
[01:25.51]and far from home
[01:30.19]you're never alone, you know
[01:33.76]just think of your friends
[01:35.98]the ones who care
[01:39.60]they all will be waiting there
[01:44.69]with love to share
[01:48.04]and your heart will lead you home
[01:55.43]
[01:58.93]funny how a photograph
[02:02.33]can take you back in time
[02:05.84]to places and embraces
[02:08.47]that you thought you'd left behind
[02:12.69]they're trying to remind you
[02:15.29]that you're not the only one
[02:18.92]no one is an island
[02:22.36]when all is said and done
[02:25.22]
[02:26.32]if you feel lost and on your own
[02:31.82]and far from home
[02:36.31]you're never alone, you know
[02:39.63]just think of your friends

[02:53.68]and your heart will lead you home
[02:58.62]
[03:01.00]there'll come a day
[03:03.00]when you're losing you way
[03:06.12]and you won't know where you belong
[03:14.29]they say that "home is where the heart is"
[03:19.33]so follow your heart
[03:22.58]and you know that you can't go wrong
[03:25.00]
[03:25.67]if you feel lost and on your own
[03:31.37]and far from home
