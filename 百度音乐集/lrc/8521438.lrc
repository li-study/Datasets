[00:07.14]The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
[00:12.26]I dreamed I held you in my arms
[00:17.79]But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
[00:23.25]And I hung my head and I cried.
[00:28.92]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[00:34.23]You make me happy when skies are gray
[00:39.73]You'll never know dear, how much I love you
[00:45.27]Please don't take my sunshine away
[01:12.92]I'll always love you and make you happy,
[01:17.95]If you will only say the same.
[01:23.39]But if you leave me and love another,
[01:28.94]You'll regret it all some day
[01:34.49]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[01:39.84]You make me happy when skies are gray
[01:45.35]You'll never know dear, how much I love you
[01:50.89]Please don't take my sunshine away
[02:18.00]You told me once, dear, you really loved me
[02:23.47]And no one else could come between.
[02:28.90]But not you've left me to love another;
[02:34.58]You have shattered all of my dreams
[02:40.17]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[02:45.39]You make me happy when skies are gray
[02:50.82]You'll never know dear, how much I love you
[02:56.51]Please don't take my sunshine away
[03:23.22]In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
[03:28.76]When I awake my poor heart pains.
[03:34.12]So when you come back and make me happy
[03:39.85]I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.
[03:45.21]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[03:50.51]You make me happy when skies are gray
[03:55.87]You'll never know dear, how much I love you
[04:01.55]Please don't take my sunshine away
