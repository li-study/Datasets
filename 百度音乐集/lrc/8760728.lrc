[00:01.06]Taj Jackson - The Moment
[00:02.06]
[00:05.06]I remember the moment
[00:07.62]I first laid eyes on you,
[00:10.60]I was shy couldn't explain the feeling
[00:13.56]Didn't know but I just knew
[00:17.72]Was so sure this was it
[00:19.95]And my search was over
[00:21.75]After everything I told her
[00:25.50]Girl I thought you felt it too
[00:30.22]
[00:30.59]How do you forget (forget)
[00:32.60]The one that took your breath away
[00:35.81]When you gave your heart out
[00:38.85]She left you with nothing to take (take, take)
[00:43.42]Now I'm picking up the pieces
[00:46.28]Cause I need to make you see
[00:49.09]
[00:49.66]Give me time
[00:51.26]And I will be fine
[00:54.18]I just need a moment
[00:57.36]To get you out my mind
[01:00.81]If I could rewind
[01:03.71]Just go back in time
[01:06.62]To the moment I fell in love with you
[01:09.85]And erase it from my mind
[01:13.28]But I just can't
[01:17.22]I just can't
[01:19.96]I just can't
[01:23.06]I just can't
[01:25.61]
[01:26.46]Now I was told that a moment
[01:28.70]Can last for all your life
[01:31.46]Though I wanted it to be forever
[01:34.64]But you wanted just one night
[01:37.10](Wanted just one night)
[01:38.58]And now I never forget (forget, forget)
[01:41.58]The way that you reminded me
[01:44.21]All the ones that broke my heart (heart)
[01:47.15]Now I'm confused of the person I should be
[01:49.94](Should be, Should be)
[01:51.71]
[01:52.03]I'm still picking up the pieces
[01:54.74]Cause that's all that's left of me
[01:57.49]
[01:57.74]Give me time
[01:59.73]And I will be fine
[02:02.55]I just need a moment
[02:05.78]To get you out my mind
[02:09.35]If I could rewind
[02:12.14]Just go back in time
[02:14.17](Just go back in time)
[02:15.54]To the moment I fell in love with you
[02:18.53]And erase it from my mind
[02:21.36]But I just can't
[02:25.49]I just can't
[02:28.48]I just can't
[02:31.65]I just can't
[02:34.17]Oooh
[02:35.22]
[02:35.59]And I'm trying hard to get over you
[02:38.54]It's something my heart won't let me do
[02:41.87]They say true love is hard to find
[02:44.79]And girl the only thing I need is
[02:48.23]
[02:48.56]Give me time
[02:50.30]And I will be fine
[02:52.28](And I will be fine)
[02:53.42]I just need a moment
[02:55.70]To get you out my mind
[02:59.14]If I could rewind
[03:01.49](If I could rewind)
[03:02.50]Just go back in time
[03:04.12](Just go back in time)
[03:05.34]To the moment I fell in love with you
[03:08.54]And erase it from my mind
[03:10.30](Erase it from my mind)
[03:12.39]But I just can't
