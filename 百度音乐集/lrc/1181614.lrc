[00:01.93]北风从今夜开始吹起
[00:12.08]我的心灯火闪闪忽明忽暗
[00:21.56]怎么说起又怎能说清这漫长迷茫的夏季
[00:31.62]当那聚会要散去时该谁远行谁不醒
[00:41.99]And time pass by
[00:46.81]And time pass by
[00:51.79]看这就是让我迷失的那座城市
[01:02.12]舞步如梦恍惚
[01:11.42]醉的人们呀举起杯笑着眼里都是泪
[01:21.37]谁在晚餐后老去像迷雾里我的心
[01:31.68]My life is in mud
[01:36.68]My life is in mud
[01:41.20]
[02:02.83]Can you help me Can you help me
[02:12.50]Can you help me Can you help me
[02:22.43]Can you help me Can you stop me
[02:27.58]Do you believe me
[02:32.57]Can you feel me So far so near
[02:37.29]So you lead me
[02:42.70]Can you hear me Can you stop me
[02:47.47]Do you believe me
[02:52.04]
[02:52.81]Can you feel me So far so nea
[02:57.76]So you lead me
[03:02.82]Can you help me Can you  lead me
[03:12.83]Can you  lead me
[03:17.67]Can you  lead me
[03:22.77]Can you  lead me
[03:27.47]Can you  lead me
[03:32.75]Can you  lead me
