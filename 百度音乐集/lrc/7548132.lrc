[00:00.00]Maroon 5 - Not Falling Apart
[00:01.00]
[00:02.38]Ooh…
[00:05.35]
[00:16.43]Danced all night, slept all day
[00:20.18]Kill us with my heart again
[00:24.23]Feelings when it comes to playing games
[00:29.32]
[00:31.70]You don’t cry, and you don’t care
[00:35.78]Afraid to have a love affair
[00:39.55]Is that your ghost or are you really there?
[00:45.26]
[00:47.41]Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
[00:51.39]Since you walked out the door
[00:55.96]And now I’m stuck living out that night again
[01:02.54]I’m not falling apart
[01:05.59]
[01:06.64]Ooh, oh
[01:10.26]
[01:12.10]Weather on a sunny day
[01:15.87]Time slows down; I wish you’d stayed
[01:20.06]Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways
[01:26.03]Mmm
[01:27.09]
[01:27.98]I try my hardest not to scream
[01:31.83]I find my heart is growing weak
[01:35.81]So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
[01:41.78]
[01:43.74]Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
[01:48.58]
[01:48.87]Since you walked out the door
[01:52.41]And now I’m stuck living out that night again
[01:58.66]I’m not falling apart
[01:59.29]
[02:00.73]I heard you say you needed me now
[02:04.84]That’s the problem I can’t see
[02:08.37]You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
[02:14.80]I’m not falling apart
[02:17.54]
[02:19.09]Take what you want
[02:23.37]And I will be just fine
[02:27.10]You’ll be better off alone at night
[02:35.28]Waiting, falling
[02:39.13]Constantly calling out your name
[02:44.86]Will it ever change?
[02:47.92]
[02:48.78]Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
[02:53.07]Since you walked out the door
[02:56.21]And now I’m stuck living out that night again
[03:02.63]I’m not falling apart
[03:03.49]
[03:04.29]I heard you say you needed me now
[03:08.06]That’s the problem I can’t see
[03:11.77]You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
[03:18.11]I’m not falling apart
[03:22.27]
[03:23.16]Ohh, ooh
[03:37.48]
[03:46.74]-----END-----
