[00:13.08]I was quiet
[00:14.61]I was tired
[00:16.15]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[00:19.87](I wanted you to make it stop,
[00:22.37]Yeah, I wanted you to bring me up.)
[00:24.42]
[00:24.69]You were wrong
[00:26.16]and I was right
[00:27.75]and I wanted yuo to bring me up.
[00:30.97](Mmm, you know me well,
[00:33.99]this is something that I shouldn’t have to tell you.)
[00:36.56]
[00:36.81]We shared humidity, and orange roses,
[00:43.27]and poking fun at all our friends.
[00:48.79]They have their barbecues, and we have our arguments;
[00:54.42]we never can agree.
[00:56.63]You said, "When you don’t talk you take it out on me."
[00:59.66]
[00:59.94]I was quiet
[01:01.31]I was tired
[01:02.65]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[01:06.51](I wanted you to make it stop,
[01:09.08]Yeah, I wanted you to bring me up.)

[01:17.78](Mmm, you know me well,
[01:20.78]this is something that I shouldn’t have to tell you.)
[01:22.91]
[01:23.97]We took a ride on our motorbike.
[01:29.64]I couldn’t talk to you, but my arms were wrapped
[01:33.49]around you tight.
[01:35.65]We stopped at Smokey’s, parked the bike outside.
[01:40.62]So scared to be sad, to keep the tears in I looked up at the sky
[01:45.37]and took another ride.
[01:46.10]
[01:46.49]But I was quiet
[01:48.14]and I was tired
[01:49.63]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[01:52.72](I ... make it stop,
[01:56.89]Yeah...bring me up.)
[01:58.39]You were wrong
[01:59.60]and I was right
[02:01.41]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[02:04.27](Mmm, you know me well,
[02:11.04]We have us.
[02:13.58]Is that enough?
[02:17.67]What is it worth to you?
[02:22.41]We have us.
[02:25.24]Is that enough?
[02:29.47]and what is it worth to you?
[02:33.47]You said,"It’s worth everything, hey baby, take a look.
[02:36.12]It’s worth all the pennies in my pocketbook."
[02:39.22]But I was quiet
[02:40.71]and I was tired
[02:42.24]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[02:45.31](I ... make it stop,
[02:48.14]Yeah...bring me up.)
[02:50.97]Yeah I was quiet
[02:52.34]and I was tired
[02:53.91]and I wanted you to bring me up.
[02:57.21](Mmm, you know me well,
[03:00.63]this is something that I shouldn’t have to tell you.)
[03:02.90]But I was quiet
[03:04.17]and I was tired
[03:05.73]and I wanted you to bring me up.
