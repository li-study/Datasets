[00:07.25]Title: Circle In The Sand
[00:22.25]Sundown all around
[00:25.87]Walking thru the summer's end
[00:29.69]Waves crash baby, don't look back
[00:33.31]I won't walk away again
[00:37.12]Oh, baby, anywhere you go,
[00:42.56]We are bound together
[00:44.74]I begin, baby, where you end
[00:48.12]Some things are forever !
[00:53.12]Circle in the sand
[00:54.81]'round and 'round
[00:56.68]Never ending love is what we've found
[01:01.43]And you complete the heart of me
[01:05.12]Our love is all we need
[01:07.99]Circle in the sand
[01:16.43]Cold wind, tide moves in
[01:20.12]Shivers in the salty air
[01:23.87]Day breaks, my heart aches
[01:27.62]I will wait for you right here.
[01:31.31]Oh, baby when you look for me
[01:36.93]Can you see forever ?
[01:38.87]I begin baby, where you end
[01:42.37]We belong together
[01:45.67]Circle in the sand
[01:48.98]'round and 'round
[01:50.92]Rising of the moon as the sun goes down
[01:55.60]And you complete the heart of me
[01:59.16]Our love is all we need
[02:02.10]Circle in the sand
[02:06.04]Circle in the sand
[02:13.42]Baby can you hear me ?
[02:20.93]Can you hear me calling ?
[02:48.31]Oh, baby, anywhere you go,
[02:53.44]We are bound together
[02:55.44]I begin, baby, where you end
[02:59.19]Some things are forever !
[03:07.75]Circle in the sand
[03:09.69]'round and 'round
[03:11.13]Never ending love is what we've found
[03:15.87]And you complete the heart of me
[03:19.56]Our love is all we need
