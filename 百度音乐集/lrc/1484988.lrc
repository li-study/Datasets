[00:01.47]Fefe Dobson
[00:01.85]
[00:05.73]Tell me who should I be to make you love me?
[00:11.87]Tell me what does it mean to be alone
[00:18.14]Can’t you see me standing, staring, out from a distance,
[00:21.92]Hear my cry if you’d only listen
[00:25.21]Out of focus into me and you
[00:30.51]Kiss me fool if you care
[00:33.72]If your words have better meaning
[00:36.67]Playing it cool is so unfair
[00:39.64]Why this veil of secrecy
[00:43.64]God forbid, friends found out what we did
[00:49.79]Why can’t someone like you be with someone like me?
[00:55.27]Tell me who should I be to make you love me?
[01:01.46]Tell me what does it mean to be alone
[01:05.99]
[01:07.61]Can’t you see me standing staring out from a distance,
[01:11.37]Hear my cry if you’d only listen
[01:14.66]Out of focus into Me and You.
[01:18.03]
[01:19.92]Touch me fool if you’re allowed
[01:22.95]I’ll be dancing in the corner
[01:26.12]It’s so cruel to play it proud
[01:29.15]Take your hands and cover me
[01:33.08]I’m aware that all in love is fair
[01:39.23]But that’s no reason to make me feel this way
[01:44.70]Tell me who should I be to make you love me?
[01:51.03]Tell me what does it mean to be alone
[01:57.08]Can’t you see me standing, staring, out from a distance,

[02:04.01]Out of focus into me and you
[02:07.38]
[02:11.59]And it hurts me so bad to deny it
[02:17.80]These feelings are out of control
[02:23.72]Do you know what its like to want something so bad?
[02:29.72]And than, having to let it go
[02:32.72]
[02:36.16]And it hurts me to know that this time in our lives
[02:42.36]So soon will be in the past
[02:44.97]
[02:48.49]And this game of pretending and playing it cool
[02:53.23]Never knowing, never knowing,
[02:56.05]Never knowing what we should have had
[03:05.43]Tell me who should I be to make you love me?
[03:11.55]Tell me what does it mean to be alone
[03:17.24]You’ve got me wondering if I’m
[03:18.36]Good enough
[03:19.79]Pretty enough
[03:21.28]Giving enough
[03:22.86]Special enough
[03:24.07]Tell me who should I be to make you love me?
[03:30.68]Who should I be
[03:32.24]Who should I be
[03:35.18]To make you love me.
[03:36.84]Who should I be
[03:38.43]Who should I be
[03:41.29]To make you love me.
[03:43.22]Who should I be
[03:44.62]Who should I be
[03:46.83]
[03:47.55]To make you love me
