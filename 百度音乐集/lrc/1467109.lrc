[00:13.33]
[00:13.72]Paper bags and plastic hearts
[00:16.89]All are belongings in shopping carts
[00:19.41]It's goodbye
[00:22.53]But we got one more night
[00:26.48]Let's get drunk and ride around
[00:29.57]And make peace with an empty town
[00:32.41]We can make it right
[00:37.33]
[00:37.95]Throw it away
[00:39.48]Forget yesterday
[00:41.14]We'll make the great escape
[00:44.26]We won't hear a word they say
[00:47.31]They don't know us anyway
[00:51.31]Watch it burn
[00:52.81]Let it die
[00:54.78]Cause we are finally free tonight
[01:01.62]
[01:04.85]Tonight will change our lives
[01:08.09]It's so good to be by your side
[01:10.56]But we'll cry
[01:13.99]We won't give up the fight
[01:17.56]We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
[01:20.83]And they'll think it's just cause were young
[01:23.56]And we'll feel so alive
[01:28.57]
[01:29.10]Throw it away
[01:30.59]Forget yesterday
[01:32.29]We'll make the great escape
[01:35.40]We won't hear a word they say
[01:38.47]They don't know us anyway
[01:42.39]Watch it burn
[01:44.08]Let it die
[01:46.00]Cause we are finally free tonight
[01:49.09]
[01:49.79]All of the wasted time
[01:52.35]The hours that were left behind
[01:55.15]The answers that we'll never find
[01:58.30]They don't mean a thing tonight
[02:05.31]
[02:14.07]Throw it away
[02:15.42]Forget yesterday
[02:17.12]We'll make the great escape
[02:20.16]We won't hear a word they say
[02:23.32]They don't know us anyway
[02:27.70]
[02:28.32]Throw it away
[02:29.81]Forget yesterday
[02:31.54]We'll make the great escape
[02:34.50]We won't hear a word they say
[02:37.74]They don't know us anyway
[02:40.92]
[02:41.37]Throw it away
[02:42.60]Forget yesterday
[02:44.34]We'll make the great escape
[02:47.34]We won't hear a word they say
[02:50.48]They don't know us anyway
[02:54.43]Watch it burn
[02:56.04]Let it die
[02:58.07]Cause we are finally free tonight
