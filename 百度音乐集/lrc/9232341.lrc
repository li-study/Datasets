[00:44.50]为何又一天
[00:46.50]仍未与我通电
[00:48.50]感觉太悬疑
[00:50.50]为何难启齿
[00:52.50]但偏偏想你知
[00:56.50]徬徨又一天
[00:58.50]期待见你一面
[01:00.50]走到你门前
[01:02.50]谁人在身边
[01:04.50]是否可讲我知
[01:08.50]这一刻我
[01:10.50]千百样心思
[01:13.50]不过两个字
[01:16.50]你叫我如此
[01:20.50]想你
[01:22.50]你叫我太欢喜
[01:25.50]装不出不羁
[01:28.50]巴不得一起
[01:32.50]想你
[01:34.50]你叫我怎心死
[01:37.50]只想今晚
[01:40.50]拥你入怀
[01:43.50]细说旧梦
[01:59.50]从前曾失恋
[02:01.50]曾话过已长大
[02:03.50]不再少年时
[02:05.50]明明曾识穿
[02:07.50]再不单思暗恋
[02:11.50]这一刻我
[02:13.50]千百样心思
[02:16.50]不过两个字
[02:19.50]你叫我如此
[02:23.50]想你
[02:25.50]你叫我太欢喜
[02:28.50]装不出不羁
[02:31.50]巴不得一起
[02:35.50]想你
[02:37.50]你叫我怎心死
[02:40.50]只想今晚
[02:43.50]拥你入怀
[02:46.50]细说旧梦
[03:10.50]想你
[03:13.50]你叫我太欢喜
[03:16.50]装不出不羁
[03:19.50]巴不得一起
[03:22.50]想你
[03:24.50]Cos I'm thinking of you
[03:25.50]你叫我怎心死
[03:28.50]只想今晚
[03:31.50]拥你入怀
[03:33.50]Do you know you'll be mine
