[00:06.71]Mama how do I begin
[00:13.95]To explain this situation we're in
[00:19.04]Angels heard the beautiful words
[00:23.28]That you prayed
[00:26.22]And showed me the way to you
[00:37.44]And they knew you were in love
[00:42.05]So they sent me down from heaven above
[00:47.17]Angels cried and kissed me goodbye
[00:51.62]I was long gone -- this is my song to you
[01:05.21]Oh, my song could never be
[01:10.47]As sweet as the song you sing to me
[01:15.28]Oh, my love could never be
[01:21.80]As deep as the love you give to me
[01:31.36]When your fingers touch my skin
[01:36.14]And you kiss my lips and tickle my chin
[01:40.78]I breathe you in, oh mama I'm where I belong
[01:48.05]This is my song to you
[01:59.71]Oh, my song could never be
[02:04.26]As sweet as the song you sing to me
[02:09.15]Oh, my love could never be
[02:15.44]As deep as the love you give to me
[02:25.30]
[02:57.76]Oh, one day I will be grown
[03:02.27]And I know I'll have a child on my own
[03:07.27]Remember me this way, cause some day
[03:11.54]I'll be long gone -- singing my song to you
[03:26.22]Oh, my song could never be
[03:30.71]As sweet as the song you sing to me
[03:35.67]Oh, my love could never be
[03:42.39]As deep as the love you give to me
[03:51.44]
