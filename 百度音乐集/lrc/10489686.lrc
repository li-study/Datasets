[00:15.27]
[01:00.08]Lately I’ve been stuck imagining
[01:03.29]What I wanna do and what I really think
[01:06.82]Time to blow out
[01:09.47]
[01:14.93]Be a little inappropriate
[01:18.09]Cause I know that everybody’s thinking it
[01:21.66]When the light’s out
[01:23.97]
[01:29.43]I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
[01:37.55]I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
[01:45.12]
[01:59.30]Lately people got me all tied up
[02:02.41]There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
[02:05.93]Time to blow out
[02:08.39]
[02:14.14]I’ve been told who I should do it with
[02:17.16]To keep both my hands above the blanket
[02:20.89]When the light’s out
[02:22.90]
[02:39.04]I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
[02:47.56]I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
[02:55.28]
[03:52.89]I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
[04:01.74]I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
