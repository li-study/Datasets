[00:26.27]Now, as I had a look at you
[00:29.88]It took a heartbeat and I knew
[00:36.90]That the candle of my life was burning shorter
[00:40.60]
[00:47.76]You turned me 'round to face myself
[00:52.27]To make me trust in what I am
[00:58.79]Now, after all that I have done it makes me wonder I'm around
[01:07.01]
[01:09.81]Now the night has gone, better days to come
[01:15.92]All this time I have been afraid, it is not too late...
[01:20.54]
[01:23.84]All this time while we talked my thoughts collided
[01:31.76]All this time I could have seen but I was blind
[01:39.68]All this time....
[01:46.50]
[01:50.11]I thought I'd never see the day
[01:54.21]That in myself I'd feel this way
[02:00.32]We are the meaning and we know
[02:04.23]Forever different - the same
[02:10.35]
[02:11.95]Now the night has gone, better days to come
[02:17.86]All this time I have strained my mind, waiting for a sign
[02:24.45]
[02:25.96]All this time while we talked my thoughts collided
[02:33.78]All this time I could have seen but I was blind
[02:41.79]All this time....
[02:47.00]
[02:51.82]Time is like a river that is running out to sea
[02:58.33]We can't touch the ground, so grab a blade of straw
[03:07.86]If you swim on waves of trust you cannot even drown
[03:13.97]When you hit the shores of love you cannot die...
[04:02.11]
[04:04.21]I thought I'd never see the day
[04:08.32]That in myself I'd feel this way
[04:14.22]We are the meaning and we know
[04:18.34]Forever different - the same
[04:22.35]
[04:25.56]Now the night has gone, better days to come
[04:32.07]All this time I have been afraid, it is not too late...
[04:38.08]
[04:39.99]All this time while we talked my thoughts collided
[04:47.81]All this time I could have seen but I was blind
[04:55.93]All this time....
