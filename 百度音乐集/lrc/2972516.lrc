[00:03.26]At night they would go walking ‘till the breaking of the day,
[00:09.78]The morning is for sleeping…
[00:16.20]Through the dark streets they go searching to see God in their own way,
[00:22.85]Save the nighttime for your weeping…
[00:30.22]Your weeping…
[00:33.04]Singing la lalalalala la lé…
[00:39.46]And the night over London lay…
[00:45.95]So we rode down to the river where the toiling ghosts spring,
[00:52.45]For their curses to be broken…
[00:59.23]We’d go underneath the arches where the witches are in the saying,
[01:05.85]There are ghost towns in the ocean…
[01:12.77]The ocean…
[01:15.63]Singing la lalalalala la lé…
[01:22.40]And the night over London lay…
[01:59.70]God is in the houses and God is in my head… and all the cemeteries in London…
[02:11.76]I see God come in my garden, but I don’t know what he said,
[02:18.18]For my heart it wasn’t open…
[02:25.29]Not open…
[02:28.74]Singing la lalalalala la lé…
[02:34.69]And the night over London lay…
[02:40.99]Singing la lalalalala la lé…
[02:47.65]There’s no light over London today…
