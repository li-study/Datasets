[03:24.08][00:05.31]
[00:08.43]Oh, girl I've known you very well
[00:13.37]I've seen you growing everyday
[00:15.78]I never really looked before
[00:18.81]but now you take my breath away.
[00:21.37]
[00:21.69]Suddenly you're in my life
[00:24.11]part of everything I do
[00:26.50]you got me working day and night
[00:29.40]just trying to keep a hold on you.
[00:32.17]
[00:32.44]Here in your arms I found my paradise
[00:37.43]my only chance for happiness
[00:42.65]and if I lose you now I think I would die.
[00:47.29]
[00:47.70]Oh say you'll always be my baby
[00:50.41]we can make it shine, we can take forever
[00:55.00]just a minute at a time.
[00:58.32]Oh, oh, oh.
[01:00.94]
[01:01.43]More than a woman, more than a woman to me
[01:11.85]more than a woman, more than a woman to me
[01:22.12]Oh, oh, oh.
[01:29.59]
[01:32.89]There are stories old and true
[01:35.32]of people so in love like you and me
[01:38.08]and I can see myself
[01:40.56]let history repeat itself.
[01:43.08]
[01:43.47]Reflecting how I feel for you
[01:45.87]thinking of those people then
[01:48.22]I know that in a thousand years
[01:51.35]I'd fall in love with you again.
[01:53.74]
[01:54.16]This is the only way that we should fly
[01:59.36]this is the only way to go
[02:04.54]and if I lose you love I know I would die.
[02:09.22]
[02:09.49]Oh say you'll always be my baby
[02:12.13]we can make it shine, we can take forever
[02:16.79]just a minute at a time.
[02:20.35]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:22.81]
[02:23.11]More than a woman, more than a woman to me
[02:33.69]more than a woman, more than a woman to me
[02:43.66]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:52.14]
[02:54.78]More than a woman, you’re more than a woman, more than a woman to me
[03:05.45]More than a woman, More than more than more than a woman to me
[03:18.02]Oh, oh, oh
