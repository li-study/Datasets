I was free when we met
You were eating a burito
With a girl - some brunette
At El Torosco's
Then you smiled like you knew
Someday we'd be together
How do I feel
Hoku
ever since I walked away from you
I miss you for real
Everyday of my life
How do I feel
Now that it's over
Well the thing that I miss the most
Is missing you
I was lost for a while
Every place brought back a memory
Of a kiss or a smile that you gave me
Well I guess
More and more I miss you
Less and less
Sometimes it's hard to let you go
Sometimes
You get trapped in a time of your life
But you know it gets a little easier over time
I miss the moody walks in the rain
I miss the poetry, I miss the days
I miss the sad songs I used to play
But the one thing I miss the most
Is missing you.
