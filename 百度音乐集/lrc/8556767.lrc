[00:20.11]Write your songs of love
[00:24.11]Like the channel of the century

[00:34.62]By you
[00:37.55]Following your lust
[00:41.53]Like an intrepid adventurer

[01:53.46]Time
[01:56.34]To write your book of wrongs
[02:00.41]And delight us like a bachelor
[02:04.87]Is that why they call you
