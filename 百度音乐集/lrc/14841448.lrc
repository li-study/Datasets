[00:00.00]
[00:05.00]Something in the way she moves
[00:13.00]Attracts me like no other lover
[00:19.00]Something in the way she woos me
[00:27.00]I don't want to leave her now
[00:30.00]You know I believe her now
[00:38.00]Somewhere in her smile she knows
[00:45.00]That I don't need no other lover
[00:52.00]Something in her style that shows me
[01:00.00]Don't want to leave her now
[01:03.00]You know I believe her now
[01:15.00]You're asking me will my love grow
[01:20.00]I don't know, I don't know
[01:28.00]You stick around now it may show
[01:34.00]I don't know, I don't know
[02:14.00]Something in the way she knows
[02:21.00]And all I have to do is think of her
[02:28.00]Something in the things she shows me
[02:35.00]Don't want to leave her now
[02:39.00]You know I believe her now
