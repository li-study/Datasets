[00:20.69]What have I got to do to make you love me
[00:28.20]What have I got to do to make you care
[00:35.66]What do I do when lightning strikes me
[00:42.57]And I wake to find that you're not there
[00:46.98]
[00:50.50]What do I do to make you want me
[00:57.61]What have I got to do to be heard
[01:05.35]What do I say when it's all over
[01:11.96]And sorry seems to be the hardest word
[01:18.36][02:19.50]
[02:20.02][01:19.91]It's sad, so sad
[02:23.88][01:23.49]It's a sad, sad situation
[02:28.13][01:27.71]And it's getting more and more absurd
[02:35.08][01:34.78]It's sad, so sad
[02:38.61][01:38.80]Why can't we talk it over
[02:42.63][01:42.68]Oh it seems to me
[02:45.72][01:45.52]That sorry seems to be the hardest word
[02:50.69][01:50.00]
[02:51.40]What do I do to make you love me
[02:58.45]What have I got to do to be heard
[03:05.97]What do I do when lightning strikes me
[03:12.35]What have I got to do
[03:16.04]What have I got to do
[03:20.20]When sorry seems to be the hardest word
