[00:13.00]
[00:16.55]By the river all alone独自一人沿着河岸
[00:20.55]Staring deep inside of my soul深深检视自己的灵魂
[00:24.55]Speaking to my intuition与直觉探讨
[00:27.29]But the words disappear言语无法表述
[00:32.35]As the waters rise and fall就像流水涨落
[00:35.59]So the tides they are within me潮汐已成为自我的一部分
[00:39.08]Running to a place unknown奔向无人的狂野
[00:42.37]To a place that I fear感受恐惧的空间
[00:47.73]Where lies my peace of mind可以容纳我的平静
[00:50.10]Tranquil serenity平静的尊严
[00:55.57]You can't see me你看不透我
[00:58.08]You can't hear me你读不懂我
[01:02.01]Yet you feel me你还没体会我的一切
[01:05.38]Deep down inside深入深入
[01:08.43]Drawing near a seeping dam如同描绘着一座渗水的大坝
[01:12.06]Where the streams become a trickle溪流汇聚成丝丝液漏
[01:16.43]Running 'tween the barren stones奔跑在光秃的岩石间
[01:19.21]Destination unknown那未知的目的地
[01:23.57]Vacant spaces in my heart就像心中空白的洞
[01:27.06]Hardened by the constant turmoil被纷扰的混乱所硬化
[01:30.06]Jaded by the sands of time被时光沙漏打磨地参差不齐
[01:34.40]In my world all alone世界只有我
[01:39.73]Where lies my peace of mind只存在平静意志的楼宇
[01:43.26]Tranquil serenity平静的高傲
[01:46.43]You can't see me你看不透我
[01:50.55]You can't hear me你读不懂我
[01:53.39]Yet you feel me你还没体会我
[01:56.80]Deep down inside深入吧……
[02:01.50]I can't see you我也看不透你
[02:05.23]I can't hear you我也读不懂你
[02:08.40]Still I feel you但我没有放弃体会你
[02:11.28]Inside of my mind用我诚挚的心
[02:41.76]
[02:45.56]You can't see me
[02:49.27]You can't hear me
[02:52.36]Yet you feel me
[02:55.16]Deep down inside
[02:58.32]I can't see you
[03:03.75]I can't hear you
[03:06.75]Still I feel you
[03:10.84]Inside of my mind
[03:13.88]You can't see me
[03:17.87]You can't hear me
[03:21.15]Yet you feel me
[03:24.15]Deep down inside...end
