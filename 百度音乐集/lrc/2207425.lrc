[00:20.59]And I'm not going back
[00:24.38]Into rags or in the hole
[00:28.26]And our bruises are coming
[00:32.23]But we will never fold
[00:36.71]
[00:36.89]And i was your silver lining
[00:40.66]As the story goes
[00:44.68]I was your silver lining
[00:48.88]But now I'm gold
[00:52.73]
[00:53.48]Hooray hooray
[00:57.01]I'm your silver lining
[01:01.22]Hooray hooray
[01:05.15]But now I'm gold
[01:09.97]
[01:11.79]And I was your silver lining
[01:15.62]High up on my toes
[01:19.62]You were running through fields of hitch-hikers
[01:23.87]As the story goes
[01:27.92]
[01:28.33]Hooray hooray
[01:31.81]I'm your silver lining
[01:36.10]Hooray hooray
[01:40.00]But now I'm gold
[01:43.95]
[01:44.35]Hooray hooray
[01:48.73]I'm your silver lining
[01:52.51]Hooray hooray
[01:56.46]But now I'm gold
[02:00.99]
[02:17.25]And the grass it was a ticking
[02:21.17]And the sun was on the rise
[02:25.15]I never felt so wicked
[02:28.92]As when I willed our love to die
[02:33.09]
[02:33.38]And I was your silver lining
[02:37.55]As the story goes
[02:41.65]I was your silver lining
[02:45.71]But now I'm gold
[02:49.78]
[02:50.01]Hooray hooray
[02:53.83]I'm your silver lining
[02:58.08]Hooray hooray
[03:02.02]But now I'm gold
[03:06.13]
[03:06.36]Hooray hooray
[03:10.21]I'm your silver lining
[03:14.44]Hooray hooray
[03:18.41]But now I'm gold
[03:22.47]
[03:22.76]But now I'm gold
[03:26.84]But now I'm gold
[03:33.64]
