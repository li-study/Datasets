[00:05.89]
[00:30.09]한 낮의 밝은 햇살은
[00:34.21]느리게 잠을 깨우고, but nothing’s mattered
[00:40.52]
[00:45.31]잊혀진 많은 얼굴들
[00:49.17]가려진 시간 속으로 where they do belong
[00:55.83]
[01:00.43]주위를 둘러보지만
[01:04.99]내 그림자만 홀로 서있네
[02:25.62][01:10.13]
[03:34.25][02:25.92][01:10.40]Do you feel lost in your place
[03:36.33][02:28.37][01:12.96]No one seems to understand your mind
[03:41.30][02:33.23][01:17.71]Does anyone care to know what is it
[03:45.76][02:37.66][01:22.17]That troubles you inside
[03:48.92][02:40.83][01:25.28]Do you feel lonely in your heart
[03:51.94][02:43.84][01:28.35]Though everything seems to be right
[03:56.44][02:48.26][01:32.64]Take a walk with me, away
[03:59.03][02:50.95][01:35.38]From everything that makes you to cry
[01:42.71]
[01:45.89]어둠 속 떠오른 달은
[01:49.77]외로운 밤을 밝히고, and nothing’s mattered
[01:56.24]
[02:01.06]흘러간 버린 날들도
[02:04.99]희미한 속삭임으로 where they do belong
[02:11.49]
[02:16.12]추억의 옛 노래 속에
[02:20.52]오지 않는 잠을 청해보네
[02:56.64]
[03:05.78]Take a walk with me now
[03:02.15]Take a walk with me now
[03:09.19]I’ll be your friend
[03:13.12]I’ll be your friend
[03:15.61]
[03:17.04]Take a deep breath of air
[03:20.41]Take a deep breath of air
[03:23.96]To clear your mind
[03:27.49]To clear your mind
[04:03.18][03:30.53]
[04:03.43]Take a walk when you feel low
[04:07.32]and nothing seems to comfort you inside
[04:10.78]
[04:11.25]Makes you cry
[04:17.12]Can’t you see inside
[04:24.64]Makes you cry
[04:32.24]Can’t you see
[04:38.86]
