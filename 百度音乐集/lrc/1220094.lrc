[00:13.40]I was down my dreams were wearing thin
[00:19.85]When you're lost where do you begin
[00:26.58]My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
[00:33.72]Looking for the love that never came my way

[00:52.99]One look then it all began for you and me
[00:59.88]The moment that we touched I knew that there would be
[01:06.60]Two less lonely people in the world And it's gonna be fine
[01:13.21]Out of all the people in the world
[01:16.55]I just can't believe you're mine
[01:19.76]In my life where everything was wrong

[01:25.39]Now there's two less lonely people
[01:28.84]In the world tonight
