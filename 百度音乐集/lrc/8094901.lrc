[00:01.46]Scarred
[00:04.53]Dream Theater
[00:07.12]Awake
[00:09.63]
[00:12.14]Music: Dream Theater
[00:14.77]
[01:07.20]To Rise, To Fall.
[01:12.45]To Hurt, To Hate.
[01:17.61]To Want, To Wait.
[01:22.75]To Heal, To Save.
[01:26.70]
[01:29.28]Can't hear it
[01:31.56]We fear it
[01:34.12]Awareness won't come near it
[01:38.58]
[01:39.29]Distractive
[01:41.91]Reactive
[01:44.56]Disguised in spite of time
[01:49.18]
[02:37.12]I never bared my emotion
[02:39.49]My passion always strong
[02:44.93]I never lost my devotion
[02:47.06]But somewhere fate went wrong
[02:51.67]
[03:01.91]Can't let them rape me again
[03:05.30]Your venom's not family here
[03:09.20]won't let them fill me with
[03:11.71]Fatalistic remedies
[03:15.38]
[03:17.58]What if the rest of the world
[03:20.61]Was hopelessly blinded by fear?
[03:26.35]Where would my sanctity live?
[03:29.56]Suddenly nobody cares.
[03:34.44]
[03:43.79]It's never enough
[03:45.13]You're wasting your time
[03:46.82]Isn't there something I could say?
[03:49.83]You don't understand
[03:51.19]You're closing me out
[03:52.82]How can we live our lives this way?
[03:55.60]
[04:05.41]You tell me I'm wrong
[04:06.90]I'm risking my life
[04:08.47]Still, I have nothing in return
[04:11.47]I show you my hands
[04:13.03]You don't see the scars
[04:14.70]Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.
[04:17.63]
[04:18.45]What if the rest of the world
[04:21.40]was hopelessly drowning in vain?
[04:27.04]Where would our self pity run?
[04:30.45]Suddenly everyone cares.
[04:35.05]
[04:35.60]Blood...Heal me
[04:37.96]Fear...Change me
[04:40.20]Belief will always save me
[04:44.68]Blood...Swearing
[04:47.02]Fear...Staring
[04:49.30]Conviction made aware
[04:53.58]
[04:54.35]Give up on misery
[04:59.54]Turn your back on dissent
[05:03.92]Leave their distrust behind
[05:09.12]Wash your hands of regret
[05:12.17]
[05:13.92]Do you feel you don't know me anymore?
[05:22.26]And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?
[05:31.61]And how come you don't want me asking?
[05:35.96]And how come my heart's not invited?
[05:40.71]You say you want everyone happy
[05:45.24]Well, we're not laughing.
[05:48.66]
[05:49.86]And how come you don't understand me?
[05:54.50]And how come I don't understand you?
[05:59.16]Thirty years say we're in this together
[06:03.81]So open your eyes.
[06:07.38]
[06:07.87]People in prayer for me
[06:09.71]Everyone there for me
[06:12.02]Sometimes I feel I should face this alone
[06:16.39]My soul exposed
[06:18.62]It calms me to know that I won't
[06:25.33]
[06:26.28]Blood...Heal me
[06:28.58]Fear...Change me
[06:30.90]Belief will always save me
[06:35.47]Blood...Swearing
[06:37.75]Fear...Staring
[06:40.03]Conviction made aware
[06:44.03]
[06:45.10]Give up on misery
[06:50.23]Turn your back on dissent
[06:54.54]Leave their distrust behind
[06:59.71]Wash your hands of regret
[07:02.79]
[08:53.34]Blood...Heal me
[08:55.62]Fear...Change me
[08:57.91]Belief will always save me
[09:02.45]Blood...Swearing
[09:04.81]Fear...Staring
[09:07.16]Conviction made aware
[09:11.22]
[09:12.39]Learning from misery
[09:17.35]Staring back at dissent
[09:21.78]Leaving distrust behind
[09:26.94]I'm inspired and content
[09:29.95]
