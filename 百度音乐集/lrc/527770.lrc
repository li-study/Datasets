[00:16.17]I gotta find a way,
[00:21.79]To find a better day...
[00:25.71]without you.
[00:33.70]And thoughts are hard to say,
[00:36.65]I miss you everyday,
[00:42.59]Now you are not here with me.
[00:46.43]
[00:49.08]I never thought that you would leave me,
[00:53.28]Ohhh...
[00:56.84]I know that time will make it easy
[01:01.14]...Baby.
[01:03.19]
[01:03.55](chorus)
[01:03.93]And you'll never know how much I'm missing you,
[01:10.19]And all of the things that I've been going through,
[01:12.83]Oh...
[01:17.45]And you'll never know how I got through it all,
[01:24.56]Now baby, I'm invincible...
[01:28.52]Oh-oh.
[01:34.55]
[01:36.95]Like sunshine after rain,
[01:41.50]I'm on my own again ...
[01:46.27]without you.
[01:52.90]I have to let you go,
[01:57.93]I wanted you to know,
[02:02.29]That I'm still here for you.
[02:08.66]
[02:09.57]It doesn't work when we're together,
[02:14.42]
[02:17.36]Just good friends,
[02:19.69]we'll last forever... Baby.
[02:23.19]
[02:25.00]And you'll never know how much I'm missing you,
[02:30.19]And all of the things that I've been going through,
[02:33.89]Oh...
[02:39.76]And you'll never know how I got through it all,
[02:46.35]Now baby, I'm invincible...
[02:49.87]Oh-oh.
[02:53.07]
[02:57.12]You never told me it would end this way,
[03:03.71]And I never said it was okay.
[03:11.24]And I never told you to leave today.
[03:20.93]How could you leave me on my own.?
[03:26.63]
[03:28.27]And you'll never know how much I'm missing you,
[03:34.62]And all of the things that I've been going through,
[03:38.06]Oh...
[03:41.85]And you'll never know how I got through it all,
[03:50.04]Now baby, I'm invincible...
[03:52.99]Oh-oh.
