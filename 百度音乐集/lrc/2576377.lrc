[00:06.49]The young gentleman came riding past
[00:09.40]on a snow-blue winter\'s day
[00:12.16]He asked to drink by our fire and
[00:15.27]I was pleased to let him stay
[00:19.03]He drank there quietly for a while
[00:20.95]and then he turned and said to me
[00:23.15]Your eyes are green
[00:25.87]Like summer grass
[00:29.09]Your lips are red
[00:31.25]like a fresh-cut rose
[00:34.97]Your hair is soft
[00:37.74]like an Irish stream
[00:41.01]And your voice is filled with sweet beauty
[00:47.17]And the last words I heard him say were
[00:54.05]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[01:02.27]And the night will come but I won\'t sleep
[01:07.12]as I watch the stars that lead him
[01:08.68]I cannot place where he is
[01:11.32]but still my heart goes with him
[01:14.37]I\'m saving all my Sunday clothes for the day
[01:19.24]that I\'ll be leaving
[01:20.79]Father knows
[01:22.66]My sister knows
[01:25.74]And my friends
[01:27.76]They\'re happy for me
[01:31.40]And the priest he says
[01:34.69]you should thank God
[01:37.64]for the blessing of such beauty
[01:43.64]And the last words I heard him say were
[01:49.30]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[01:58.04]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[02:15.50]On Christmas Day
[02:28.30]I shall return for you
[02:31.97]My love...
[02:49.12]And the last words I heard him say
[02:54.87]Were the last words I ever heard him say
[03:03.48]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[03:10.65]I said I will return on Christmas Day
[03:20.52]And yes, I shall return on Christmas day
[03:22.90]I shall return, for you, on Christmas Day
[03:27.93]My love
[03:29.29]I will return on Christmas Day
[03:34.33]I shall return ,my love, on Christmas Day
[03:44.60]On Christmas Day
