[00:01.12]Green Day - Song of the Century
[00:03.12]
[00:08.30]Sing us a song of the century
[00:13.04]That's louder than bombs And eternity
[00:17.67]The era of static and contraband
[00:22.24]That's leading us to the promised land
[00:26.91]Tell us a story that's by candlelight
[00:31.60]Waging a war and losing the fight
[00:36.10]They're playing the song of the century
[00:41.18]Of panic and promise and prosperity
[00:45.91]Tell me a story into that goodnight
[00:50.98]Sing us a song for me
