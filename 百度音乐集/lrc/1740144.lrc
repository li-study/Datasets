[00:21.34]I tried to fly away
[00:26.68]I tried to find a place
[00:30.77]Followed a shooting star
[00:33.18]We fired up the car
[00:36.20]And travelled to after
[00:39.21]Everyday
[00:40.61]
[00:40.95]We shared a "Sianese dream"
[00:45.90]Beside the schoolyard stairs
[00:50.03]The songs we used to love
[00:52.44]No longer good enough
[00:55.43]To keep you from burning up
[01:00.54]
[01:00.90]Please take me back in time with you
[01:07.09]To a time when you were trun
[01:11.58]Visit all seven wonders
[01:14.63]There won't be another
[01:17.01]To keep me satisfied
[01:21.17]If I can fall back into you
[01:26.21]There is nothing I can't do
[01:30.71]If I'm under the weather
[01:33.83]We talk, I feel better
[01:36.26]At least I knew I had
[01:39.91]Someone who cared
[01:42.83]
[01:45.14]Somebody baby
[01:48.95]
[01:59.94]I tried to stay away
[02:05.02]I tried to give you space
[02:09.25]I could't help myself
[02:11.65]I only wanted to help
[02:14.64]You pushed my arms away
[02:17.59]Then one day
[02:18.85]
[02:19.45]You walked another way
[02:24.26]A place I couldn't stay
[02:28.41]My compass fell apart
[02:30.85]I don't know where to star
[02:33.85]To keep this from tearing up
[02:38.92]
[02:39.37]Please take me back in time with you
[02:45.48]To a time when you were trun
[02:50.00]Visit all seven wonders
[02:53.02]There won't be another
[02:55.43]To keep me satisfied
[02:59.62]If I can fall back into you
[03:04.68]There is nothing I can't do
[03:09.27]If I'm under the weather
[03:12.16]We talk, I feel better
[03:14.62]At least I knew I had
[03:18.14]Someone who cared
