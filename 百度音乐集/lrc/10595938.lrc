[00:10.18]歌∶MiChi
[00:13.18]
[00:15.18]There is freedom with in
[00:18.88]There is freedom without
[00:21.47]Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
[00:27.42]There's a battle ahead
[00:30.81]Many battles are lost
[00:33.63]But you'll never see the end of the road
[00:35.59]While you're travelling with me
[00:38.96]Hey now, hey now
[00:41.57]Don't dream it's over
[00:44.82]Hey now, hey now
[00:47.35]When the world comes in
[00:50.76]They come, they come
[00:53.59]To build a wall between us
[00:57.03]We know they won't win
[00:59.67]
[01:03.08]Now I'm towing my car
[01:06.85]there's a hole in the roof
[01:09.53]My possessions are causing me suspicion
[01:11.72]but there's no proof
[01:14.37]In the paper today tales of war and of waste
[01:21.50]But you turn right over to the TV page
[01:26.99]Hey now, hey now
[01:29.80]Don't dream it's over
[01:32.86]Hey now, hey now
[01:35.56]When the world comes in
[01:38.80]They come, they come
[01:41.65]To build a wall between us
[01:45.02]We know they won't win
[01:48.13]
[02:31.47]Now I'm walking again
[02:33.77]To the beat of a drum
[02:36.11]And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
[02:42.49]Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
[02:48.43]Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief
[02:53.96]Hey now, hey now
[02:56.59]Don't dream it's over
[02:59.82]Hey now, hey now
[03:02.52]When the world comes in
[03:05.75]They come, they come
[03:08.64]To build a wall between us
[03:11.78]We know they won't win
[03:15.80]
