[00:12.06]A day once dawned,
[00:15.74]and it was beautiful
[00:20.05]A day once dawned from the ground
[00:28.83]Then the night she fell
[00:33.51]And the air was beautiful
[00:38.20]The night she fell all around.
[00:47.09]So look see the days
[00:51.60]The endless coloured ways
[00:55.84]And go play the game that you learnt
[01:02.97]From the morning.
[01:13.77]And now we rise
[01:17.85]And we are everywhere
[01:22.07]And now we rise from the ground
[01:30.53]And see she flies
[01:34.77]And she is everywhere
[01:39.16]See she flies all around
[01:49.15]So look see the sights
[01:51.84]The endless summer nights
[01:56.56]And go play the game that you learnt
[02:03.26]From the morning.
