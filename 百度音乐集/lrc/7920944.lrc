[ti:mad about you]
[ar:Sting]

[00:34.97]A stone's throw from Jerusalem
[00:37.79]I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
[00:40.93]And though a million stars were shining
[00:43.85]My heart was lost on a distant planet
[00:46.85]That whirls around the April moon
[00:49.28]Whirling in an arc of sadness
[00:52.24]I'm lost without you, I'm lost without you
[00:57.73]Though all my kingdoms turn to sand and fall into the sea
[01:02.94]I'm mad about you, I'm mad about you
[01:08.81]And from the dark secluded valleys
[01:11.89]I heard the ancient songs of sadness
[01:14.68]But every step I thought of you
[01:16.87]Every footstep only you
[01:20.16]Every star a grain of sand
[01:23.49]The leavings of a dried up ocean
[01:25.88]Tell me, how much longer,
[01:27.25]How much longer?
[01:32.18]They say a city in the desert lies
[01:34.85]The vanity of an ancient king
[01:37.22]But the city lies in broken pieces
[01:39.93]Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
[01:42.77]These are the works of man
[01:45.32]This is the sum of our ambition
[01:48.55]It would make a prison of my life
[01:51.96]If you became another's wife
[01:54.28]With every prison blown to dust
[01:56.47]My enemies walk free
[01:59.46]I'm mad about you, I'm mad about you
[02:04.40]And I have never in my life
[02:09.03]Felt more alone than I do now
[02:13.83]Although I claim dominions over all I see
[02:16.51]It means nothing to me
[02:22.10]There are no victories In all our histories
[02:27.21]Without love
[02:33.46]A stone's throw from Jerusalem
[02:36.28]I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
[02:39.72]And though a million stars were shining
[02:42.25]My heart was lost on a distant planet
[02:45.13]That whirls around the April moon
[02:47.58]Whirling in an arc of sadness
[02:50.46]I'm lost without you, I'm lost without you
[03:01.65]And though you hold the keys to ruin of everything I see
[03:23.74]With every prison blown to dust my enemies walk free
[03:29.81]Though all my kingdoms turn to sand and fall into the sea
[03:35.03]I'm mad about you, I'm mad about you
