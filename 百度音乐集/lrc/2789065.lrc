[00:01.53]Evanescence - Together Again
[00:08.00]
[00:28.21]Never thought that I'd be leaving you today
[00:37.19]So alone and wondering why I feel this way
[00:44.68]
[00:46.10]So wide the world
[00:49.33]Can love remember
[00:52.43]How to get me home to you
[00:59.29]Someday
[01:06.51]
[01:10.71]We'll be together again
[01:19.83]All just a dream in the end
[01:29.06]We'll be together again
[01:35.62]
[01:40.75]So many fears were swimming
[01:45.35]Around and around in my mind
[01:49.96]Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find
[01:59.60]
[02:18.60]I've found a world where love and dreams
[02:24.49]And darkness all collide
[02:28.17]Maybe this time
[02:31.59]We can leave our broken world behind
[02:42.84]
[03:01.39]We'll be together again
[03:07.67]
[03:10.68]All just a dream in the end
[03:15.30]
