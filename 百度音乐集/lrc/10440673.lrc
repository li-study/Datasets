[00:27.41]If I had no more time
[00:30.77]No more time left to be here
[00:34.26]Would you cherish what we had?
[00:36.76]Was it everything that you were looking for?
[00:41.84]If I couldn’t feel your touch
[00:45.98]And no longer were you with me
[00:49.27]I’d be wishing you were here
[00:51.97]To be everything that I’d be looking for
[00:55.43]I don’t wanna forget the present is a gift
[01:02.57]And I don’t wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
[01:09.14]‘Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed
[01:16.26]

[02:08.94]Millions never will
[02:12.38]Do you know until you lose it
[02:14.99]That it’s everything that we are looking for
[02:17.70]When I wake up in the morning
[02:23.72]You’re beside me
