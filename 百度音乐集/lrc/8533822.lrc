[00:31.00]Woke up in London yesterday
[00:33.94]Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
[00:36.75]Don't really know how I got here
[00:39.35]I got some pictures on my phone
[00:40.35]
[00:41.39]New names and numbers that I don't know
[00:43.70]Address to places like Abbey Road
[00:46.28]Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
[00:49.68]We're young enough to say
[00:50.68]
[00:51.65]Oh this has gotta be the good life
[00:55.15]This has gotta be the good life
[00:56.89]This could really be a good life, good life
[00:58.89]
[01:00.72]Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
[01:04.28]Like this city is on fire tonight
[01:06.74]This could really be a good life
[01:09.98]A good, good life
[01:15.89]
[01:22.38]To my friends in New York, I say hello
[01:24.72]My friends in L.A. they don't know
[01:27.10]Where I've been for the past few years or so
[01:29.75]Paris to China to Col-or-ado
[01:30.60]
[01:31.23]Sometimes there's airplanes I can' t jump out
[01:33.71]Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
[01:36.23]We are god of stories but please tell me-e-e-e
[01:39.48]What there is to complain about
[01:42.18]When you're happy like a fool
[01:44.82]Let it take you over
[01:45.58]
[01:47.12]When everything is out
[01:49.72]You gotta take it in
[01:52.14]Oh this has gotta be the good life
[01:54.38]This has gotta be the good life
[01:57.00]This could really be a good life, good life
[02:00.00]
[02:00.90]Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
[02:04.36]Like this city is on fire tonight
[02:06.88]This could really be a good life
[02:10.14]A good, good life
[02:13.18]
[02:32.06]Hopelessly
[02:33.20]I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
[02:36.82]Hopelessly
[02:38.08]I feel like the window closes oh so quick
[02:42.08]Hopelessly
[02:43.59]I'm taking a mental picture of you now
[02:47.15]'Cuz hopelessly
[02:48.49]The hope is we have so much to feel good about
[02:51.49]
[02:52.99]Oh this has gotta be the good life
[02:56.06]This has gotta be the good life
[02:58.60]This could really be a good life, good life
[03:00.44]
[03:02.59]Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
[03:05.91]Like this city is on fire tonight
[03:08.67]This could really be a good life
[03:11.78]A good, good life
