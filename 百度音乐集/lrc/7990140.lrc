[00:16.23]
[00:18.23]summer rain falls on the apple branches
[00:23.86]lights from heaven dancing with the shadows
[00:29.78]come take my hand
[00:32.65]let me be in your forest
[00:38.35]
[00:41.75]sometimes you think loneliness is better than pain
[00:48.43]and you sink deeper in your valley
[00:53.80]is this the place to be, in your memory?
[01:04.75]no, I never wanna lose you in the forest of the night
[01:10.93]in vanity's lair
[01:13.63]yearning for the angel calling
[01:17.12]hear the lonely prayer ringing through the land of rain
[01:22.52]across the thin air
[01:25.56]they sing voice to voice
[01:27.42]the ancient melodies
[01:32.15]calling you
[01:38.35]
[01:41.27]autumn goes by
[01:43.99]combing twilight into my hair
[01:47.50]I look back on the passing tenderness
[01:52.66]let me stay by your side
[01:57.53]In your memory
[02:04.03]no, you never gonna find me in the forest of the night
[02:10.12]in vanity's lair
[02:12.87]no more holly angel calling
[02:16.43]hear my lonely prayer ringing through the land of rain
[02:22.16]across the thin air
[02:24.63]we sing voice to voice
[02:26.64]the ancient melodies
[02:33.93]I'm calling you
[02:40.37]
[03:30.10]no, I never wanna lose you in the forest of the night
[03:35.87]in vanity's lair
[03:39.19]yearning for the angel calling
[03:42.56]hear the lonely prayer ringing through the land of rain
[03:48.14]across the thin air
[03:50.77]they sing voice to voice
[03:53.19]the ancient melodies
[03:59.80]I'm calling you
