[00:00.20]He said "I'll love you 'til I die".
[00:07.20]She told him "You'll forget in time".
[00:14.30]As the years went slowly by,
[00:20.85]she still preyed upon his mind.
[00:25.00]
[00:27.20]He kept her picture on his wall,
[00:34.15]went half crazy now and then.
[00:40.68]He still loved her through it all,
[00:47.98]hoping she'd come back again.
[00:51.92]
[00:54.50]Kept some letters by his bed,
[01:01.72]dated 1962..
[01:08.43]He had underlined in red
[01:15.06]every single "I love you".
[01:18.72]
[01:21.21]I went to see him just today.
[01:28.14]Oh, but I didn't see no tears.
[01:34.89]All dressed up to go away,
[01:41.21]first time I'd seen him smile in years.
[01:45.88]
[01:48.68]He stopped loving her today.
[01:54.00]They placed a wreath upon his door,
[02:01.43]and soon they'll carry him away.
[02:08.31]He stopped loving her today.
[02:13.56]
[02:18.48]{You know she came to see him one last time.}
[02:24.20]{Oh and we all wondered if she would.}
[02:31.94]{And it kept running through my mind}
[02:37.16]{This time.. he's over her for good.}
[02:39.48]
[02:40.64]He stopped loving her today.
[02:46.93]They placed a wreath upon his door,
[02:53.83]and soon they'll carry him away.
[03:00.51]He stopped loving her today..
