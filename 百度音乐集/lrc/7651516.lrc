[00:16.21]Where it began, i can't begin to know when
[00:24.00]But then i know it's growing strong
[00:31.60]wasn't the spring
[00:35.95]And spring became the summer
[00:39.84]Who'd believe you'd come along
[00:45.86]Hands, touching hands, reaching out
[00:57.16]Touching me, touching you

[01:09.45]Good times never seem so good

[01:24.07]but now I, I look at the night
[01:31.71]And it don't seem so lonely
[01:35.92]We fill it up with only two
[01:43.42]And when i hurt
[01:46.90]Hurting runs off my shoulders
[01:50.58]How can i hurt when holding you
[01:57.24]one, touching one, reaching out
[02:08.76]Touching me, touching you
