[00:17.51]you were born on this earth
[00:19.91]Don't pin all your hopes and your

[00:25.83]The Southern cross is twinkling and watching us

[00:43.67]Passion, Joy, Sorrow, pain and tears.
[00:46.17]All they will be pabulum of your life.
[00:49.24]Go, if you come under the wet yourself.
[00:52.03]Fight, fight for the person you believe in.

[02:16.19]Is there a thing which is superior to love in this world?
[02:21.88]A man is living with loving someone and then being loved by others.
[02:27.22]We are standing here as true as we were born on this earth.
[02:32.73]The moment of yesterday when we lived is never waste.
[02:38.56]
[02:40.22]Go, if you come up against a hurdle.

[03:10.59]may be treasure when you are old
[03:14.11]Go, if you come away from your way.
[03:16.49]Find, find your own way that you believe in.
[03:19.40]Destiny is challenging you...
[03:21.92]“Obey me, or defy me”
[03:24.00]
[03:25.08]We cannot turn back to our past.
[03:27.80]We cannot change our past.
[03:29.75]However, we're heading for the future.
[03:33.40]So, let us reach out our hands.....our hands!
