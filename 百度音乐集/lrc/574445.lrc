[00:03.26]
[00:08.10]I want a real love
[00:10.48]To let me in
[00:12.09]I want to zero out
[00:14.25]And be born again
[00:16.25]No more false starts and no dead ends
[00:20.07]
[00:23.51]Cause I'm no shape
[00:25.75]To do what's right
[00:27.70]I see up that's down and black that's white
[00:31.55]It makes me dizzy I come apart
[00:35.27]All this love love love in the dark
[00:39.09]
[00:39.73]Mercy mercy both hands
[00:43.25]I need less drowning and more land
[00:47.51]Mercy mercy, understand
[00:51.44]Less drowning, more land, less drowning
[00:57.87]
[00:58.71]Lay a fire in the crowd
[01:00.92]Just to watch you move
[01:02.73]Tie your hands and demand a salute
[01:06.43]All these gardens full of snakes and fruit
[01:11.71]
[01:14.37]Hear the click click click
[01:16.07]And the camera flash
[01:17.90]It's in the definite kick up in the fame ball blast
[01:22.09]But they don't call and they don't last
[01:25.97]And you're gone, outshine
[01:29.51]
[01:30.12]Mercy mercy both hands
[01:33.55]I need less drowning and more land
[01:37.87]Mercy mercy, understand
[01:41.71]Less drowning, more land, less drowning
[01:48.41]
[01:49.75]Come on kill the light
[01:52.94]Leave it all behind
[01:57.15]I'm right by your, I'm right by your side
[02:04.68]Lean on the tick of time
[02:09.08]Put your hand in in mine
[02:12.96]Watch you, watch you ignite
[02:23.08]
[02:28.25]Mercy mercy both hands
[02:31.96]I need less drowning and more land
[02:35.93]Mercy mercy, understand
[02:39.61]Less drowning, more land,
[02:43.74]Mercy mercy, I'm in your hands
[02:47.36]I look into your eyes and I see life end
[02:51.45]Mercy mercy, understand

[02:59.74]Less drowning, more land.
