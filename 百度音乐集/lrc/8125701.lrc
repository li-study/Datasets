[00:32.93]
[00:34.00]So long, I've been looking too hard.
[00:37.00]I've been waiting too long.
[00:45.00]Sometimes I don't know what I will find.
[00:48.00] I only know it's a matter of time.
[00:54.00]When you love someone,
[00:55.66]when you love someone.
[01:02.00]It feels so right, so warm and true.
[01:08.00] I need to know if you feel it too.
[01:12.00]Maybe I'm wrong,
[01:14.84]won't you tell me if I'm
[01:16.85]coming on too strong.
[01:20.00]This heart of mine has been hurt before,
[01:25.00]this time I wanna be sure.
[01:29.00]I've been waiting for a girl like you
[01:34.71]to come into my life.
[01:38.00]I've been waiting for a girl like you,
[01:44.33]your loving will survive.
[01:48.00]I've been waiting for someone new
[01:53.77]to make me feel alive.
[01:58.00]Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
[02:03.35]to come into my life.
[02:08.34][Music].........................[Music]
[02:17.00]You're so good,
[02:21.95]when we make love it's understood.
[02:24.00]It's more than a touch
[02:29.29]or a word can say:
[02:32.00]"Only in dreams could it be this way."
[02:37.00]When you love someone,
[02:39.98]yeah, really love someone.
[02:48.00]Now I know it's right,
[02:50.13]from the moment I wake up
[02:52.92]till deep in the night.
[02:56.00]There's nowhere on earth
[02:57.54]that I'd rather be
[03:00.16]than holding you tenderly.
[03:05.00]I've been waiting for a girl like you
[03:09.89]to come into my life
[03:15.00]I've been waiting for a girl like you,
[03:19.24]your loving will survive.
[03:23.00]I've been waiting for someone new
[03:28.71]to make me feel alive.
