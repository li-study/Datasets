[00:00.45]I'm not the one who's so far away
[00:04.56]When I feel the snake bite enter my veins.
[00:09.35]Never did I wanna be here again,
[00:13.02]And I don't remember why I came.
[00:18.71]Godsmack ---- voodoo
[00:50.47]Candles raise my desire,
[00:54.91]Why I'm so far away.
[00:58.77]No more meaning to my life,
[01:02.86]No more reason to stay.
[01:06.76]Freezing, feeling,
[01:10.77]Breathe in, breathe in...
[01:16.17]I'm coming back again...
[01:21.36]I'm not the one who's so far away
[01:24.94]When I feel the snake bite enter my veins.
[01:29.37]Never did I wanna be here again,
[01:33.01]And I don't remember why I came.
[01:37.60]Godsmack ----- voodoo
[01:54.10]Hazing clouds rain on my head,
[01:58.04]Empty thoughts fill my ears.
[02:01.87]Find my shape by the moonlight,
[02:05.77]Why my thoughts aren't so clear.
[02:09.77]Demons dreaming,
[02:13.57]Breathe in, breathe in...
[02:19.06]I'm coming back again...
[03:47.54][03:31.95][02:40.79][02:24.60]I'm not the one who's so far away
[03:50.75][03:34.94][02:43.74][02:27.94]When I feel the snake bite enter my veins.
[03:55.27][03:39.56][02:48.06][02:32.43]Never did I wanna be here again,
[03:58.65][03:43.04][02:51.88][02:36.06]And I don't remember why I came.
[02:55.26]Godsmack ----- voodoo
[04:03.49]Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo, voodoo.
[04:21.09]So far away...
[04:23.47]I'm not the one who's so far away...
[04:26.97]I'm not the one who's so far away...
[04:30.67]I'm not the one who's so far away...
