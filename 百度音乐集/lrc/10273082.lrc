[00:09.60]My daddy got here on the gravy train
[00:14.10]I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
[00:19.40]They went walking and she took his name
[00:22.90]Round here
[00:28.10]There was dancing in the afternoons those days
[00:33.20]Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made
[00:37.80]It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same
[00:47.55]Frightened little girl, she makes a break
[00:52.20]Into the arms of something better
[00:59.70]Round here
[01:05.40]I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
[01:10.00]Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark
[01:15.00]Waiting patiently to make my mark
[01:18.70]Round here
[01:23.50]And I remember my first day at school
[01:28.50]And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool
[01:34.60]I remember it all, oh yeah, like yesterday
[01:42.00]Don't you
[01:43.50]Every time I try to leave this place
[01:47.80]Something inside says, You can do better, yeah...
[01:55.30]Round here
[01:59.30]So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
[02:06.50]I want to put my hands in this earth again
[02:10.80]Music fell like rain to the streets
[02:15.20]The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat
[02:19.10]Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world
[02:27.00]I gotta be thankful that this crowded space is the place of my birth
[02:36.70]When all that I wanted, was to be someone
[02:46.60]Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
[02:51.90]Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls
[02:57.00]Andy says it's time to show them all
[03:00.60]Round here
[03:06.00]Please sir, we two have other plans
[03:10.70]Please sir you would not understand
[03:14.00]What's going on is magical, can't you see
[03:21.50]That some of us do more than dream
[03:25.40]Every time I try to leave this place
[03:29.80]Something inside says, Keep on keeping, on and on...
[03:37.50]Around here
[03:41.20]So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
[03:48.80]I want to put my hands in this earth again
[03:53.00]Music fell like rain to the streets
[03:57.30]The Specials and The Jam, ABC
[04:01.30]Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world
[04:08.70]I gotta be thankful that this crowded space is the place of my birth
[04:19.00]My birth
[04:24.00]In this town
[04:27.30]Yes I guess I got to be someone
[04:37.00]To be somebody
[04:42.00]In the Beautiful city
[04:46.00]This place I call home
[04:51.00]These streets of London
[04:55.43]It's everything I know (everything and everybody)
[04:59.50]On the streets of London
[05:05.00]I want to thank you...
[05:25.50][05:20.80][05:16.50]My daddy got here on the gravy train
