[00:02.00]Goodbye
[00:06.00]Air Supply
[00:10.60]
[00:16.35]I can see the pain living in your eyes
[00:20.48]And I know how hard you try
[00:24.38]You deserve to have so much more
[00:31.01]I can feel your heart and I sympathize
[00:34.82]And I'll never criticize
[00:39.27]All you've ever meant to my life
[00:44.61]I don't want to let you down
[00:47.79]I don't want to lead you on
[00:52.08]I don't want to hold you back
[00:54.24]From where you might belong
[00:59.34]You would never ask me why
[01:04.17]My heart is so disguised
[01:07.85]I just can't live a lie anymore
[01:13.83]I would rather hurt myself
[01:18.81]Than to ever make you cry
[01:22.59]There's nothing left to say but goodbye
[01:31.13]
[01:44.08]You deserve a chance at the kind of love
[01:48.23]I'm not sure I'm worthy of
[01:52.25]Losing you is painful to me
[01:57.90]I don't want to let you down
[02:01.12]I don't want to lead you on
[02:05.16]I don't want to hold you back
[02:07.55]From where you might belong
[02:12.50]You would never ask me why
[02:17.43]My heart is so disguised
[02:21.18]I just can't live a lie anymore
[02:27.20]I would rather hurt myself
[02:32.09]Than to ever make you cry
[02:35.88]There's nothing left to say but goodbye
[02:45.52]
[03:01.22]You would never ask me why
[03:06.01]My heart is so disguised
[03:09.69]I just can't live a lie anymore
[03:15.59]I would rather hurt myself
[03:20.57]Than to ever make you cry
[03:24.36]There's nothing left to try
[03:28.06]Now it's gonna hurt us both
[03:32.01]it's no other way than to say goodbye
[03:42.59]
