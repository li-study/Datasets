[00:25.50]一辈子的时间
[00:28.18]可以画出好多条路线
[00:31.24]可以和不同的他 走过路边
[00:34.19]可以在不同的店 脚步缠绵
[00:37.63]有一条路 不会再去的一条路
[00:43.47]曾经走厌倦的一条路
[00:46.53]现在闭眼就浮现的一条路
[00:49.83]
[00:50.14]路的左边 有我们拍过照的玩具店
[00:56.29]路的右边 是一排大树和一个秋千
[01:02.38]路的上面 自行车来来去去好多遍
[01:08.55]路的前面 是我们乘公车回去的站点

[01:45.77]I had a man
[01:48.13]They know that I had a man
[01:51.57]a handsome man
[01:54.42]a delicious man
[01:57.79]I love him
[02:00.33]they know that I love him
[02:03.84]I love him every day
[02:06.65]but at last he went away
[02:09.54]
[02:10.08]beyond the scenery
[02:13.18]love is the most beautiful thing
[02:16.22]but no things evergreen
[02:19.27]so do the love and tree
[02:22.34]if only could my death
[02:25.41]be your savalation
[02:28.58]fine be it be it
[02:36.68]
[02:41.11]beyond the scenery
[02:43.88]love is the most beautiful thing
[02:46.97]but no things evergreen
[02:50.00]so do the love and tree
[02:53.12]if only could my death
[02:56.14]be your savalation
[02:59.36]fine be it be it
[03:06.94]
