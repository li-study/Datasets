[00:04.96]唱：尚雯婕
[00:07.96]
[00:15.48]Try to remember the kind of September
[00:21.95]When life was slow and oh so mellow
[00:29.06]Try to remember the kind of September
[00:35.72]When grass was green and grain was yellow
[00:42.92]Try to remember the kind of September
[00:49.70]When you were a young and a callow fellow
[00:56.85]Try to remember and if you remember
[01:03.90]Then follow
[01:07.30]follow
[01:12.22]
[01:24.41]Try to remember when life was so tender
[01:31.07]When no one wept except the willow
[01:38.37]Try to remember when life was so tender
[01:45.02]When dreams were kept beside your pillow
[01:52.15]Try to remember when life was so tender
[01:58.78]When love was an ember about to billow
[02:06.03]Try to remember and if you remember
[02:12.63]Then follow
[02:16.63]follow
[02:22.10]
[02:49.38]Deep in December it's nice to remember
[02:56.02]Although you know the snow will follow
[03:03.07]Deep in December it's nice to remember
[03:09.85]Without a hurt, the heart will hollow
[03:16.91]Deep in December it's nice to remember
[03:23.71]The fire of September that made you mellow
[03:30.87]Deep in December our hearts should remember
[03:37.71]Then follow
[03:41.32]follow
[03:47.90]
