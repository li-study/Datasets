[00:00.12]Casting Crowns - Jesus, Friend of Sinners
[00:02.20].
[00:04.29].
[00:05.86].
[00:22.31]Jesus, friend of sinners
[00:25.13]We have strayed so far away
[00:29.31]We cut down people in Your name
[00:32.69]But the sword was never ours to swing
[00:38.56]Jesus, friend of sinners
[00:40.88]The truth''s become so hard to see
[00:45.69]The world is on their way to You
[00:49.31]But they''re tripping over me
[00:51.94].
[00:53.50]Always looking around but never looking up
[00:56.25]I''m so double minded
[00:58.25]
[01:00.29]A plank-eyed saint with dirty hands
[01:02.98]And a heart divided
[01:05.79].
[01:06.79]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[01:13.10]Open our eyes to the world
[01:15.48]At the end our pointing fingers
[01:19.79]Let our hearts be led by mercy
[01:26.22]Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
[01:33.37]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[01:36.62]Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
[01:42.12].
[01:45.93]
[01:53.31]Jesus, friend of sinners
[01:55.31]The One whose writing in the sand
[01:59.00]Made the righteous turn away
[02:02.25]And the stones fall from their hands
[02:05.50]Help us to remember
[02:08.63]We are all the least of these
[02:12.06]Let the memory of Your mercy
[02:15.19]Bring Your people to their knees
[02:18.44].
[02:19.31]Nobody knows what we''re for
[02:21.25]Only what we''re against
[02:22.75]When we judge the wounded
[02:24.31]
[02:25.82]What if we put down our signs
[02:27.63]Crossed over the lines
[02:29.13]And loved like You did
[02:31.51].
[02:32.76]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[02:39.01]Open our eyes to the world
[02:41.32]At the end our pointing fingers
[02:45.76]Let our hearts be led by mercy
[02:52.20]Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
[02:59.26]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[03:02.57]Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
[03:07.32].
[03:08.45]You love every lost cause
[03:11.57]You reach for the outcast
[03:15.32]For the leper and the lame
[03:18.51]They''re the reason that You came
[03:21.38]Lord, I was that lost cause
[03:24.57]And I was the outcast
[03:27.57]But You died for sinners just like me
[03:31.13]A grateful leper at Your feet
[03:34.20].
[03:35.76]Cause You are good
[03:39.07]You are good
[03:42.38]And Your love endures forever
[03:48.89]Cause You are good
[03:52.01]You are good
[03:55.38]And Your love endures forever
[04:02.13]Cause You are good
[04:05.07]You are good
[04:08.39]And Your love endures forever
[04:15.14]Cause You are good
[04:17.26]
[04:18.25]You are good
[04:21.57]And Your love endures forever
[04:27.69].
[04:28.76]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[04:34.01]Open our eyes to the world
[04:36.51]At the end our pointing fingers
[04:40.88]Let our hearts be led by mercy
[04:47.32]Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
[04:54.44]Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
[04:57.76]Break our hearts for what breaks Yours
[05:02.26].
[05:10.15]And I was the lost cause
[05:13.33]And I was the outcast
[05:16.83]
[05:17.95]You died for sinners just like me
[05:26.20]A grateful leper at Your feet
[05:29.26].
