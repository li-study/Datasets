[00:21.06]Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
[00:25.43]In the lane, snow is glistening
[00:29.75]A beautiful sight,
[00:31.95]We're happy tonight,
[00:34.06]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:38.24]
[00:40.21]Gone away is the bluebird
[00:44.36]Here to stay is a new bird
[00:48.67]He sings a love song,
[00:50.92]As we go along,
[00:53.03]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:57.21]
[00:57.51]In the meadow we can build a snowman
[01:01.50]Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
[01:05.04]He'll say: Are you married?
[01:07.82]We'll say: No man,
[01:09.81]But you can do the job
[01:11.36]When you're in town
[01:13.54]
[01:13.98]Later on, we'll conspire
[01:17.78]As we dream by the fire
[01:20.48]To face unafraid
[01:24.74]The plans that we've made,
[01:26.74]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[01:30.68]
[02:05.51]In the meadow we can build a snowman,
[02:08.90]And pretend that he's Charlie Brown
[02:13.33]We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
[02:17.28]Until all the other children knock him down.
[02:23.14]When it snows, ain't it thrilling
[02:27.28]Though your nose gets a chilling
[02:31.99]We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
[02:36.18]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[02:39.93]
[02:40.45]Walking in a winter wonderland,
[02:44.74]Walking in a winter wonderland.
