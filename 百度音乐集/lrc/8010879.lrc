[00:03.02]
[00:10.02]Last call for regret and defeat
[00:12.23]To finish the bottle full of empty dreams
[00:14.74]Punch strong head that was straight out of line
[00:17.14]Another excuse with no alibi
[00:19.60]Hitchin on the road of decline
[00:21.95]With no name streets and no vital signs
[00:24.48]I pissed away the best of me and
[00:27.03]No one can help me!
[00:29.40]
[00:31.85]Misery\'s best friend
[00:33.03]Can\'t be a dead-end
[00:34.28]A bag full of regrets and I\'m coming clean
[00:36.66]So feel it
[00:37.95]Especially the rejects
[00:39.23]A bad habit
[00:40.33]Don\'t forget it you better
[00:41.60]Count your last blessings
[00:42.64]And fill up the wagon
[00:43.91]Chases this fee
[00:44.93]And now I\'m running out of time
[00:56.29]
[00:56.48]My hands are tied
[00:57.38]And nailed to the cross
[00:58.38]I\'m looking for all the composure I lost
[01:00.86]I\'m petulant with a bad attitude
[01:03.40]A poster-child vision of wasted youth
[01:05.88]I dodged the book and found the key
[01:08.33]I can\'t say the same for dignity
[01:10.80]I pissed away the best of me and
[01:13.33]No one can help me
[01:15.82]
[01:18.20]Misery\'s best friend

[01:23.28]So feel it
[01:24.26]Especially the rejects
[01:25.56]A bad habit
[01:26.64]Don\'t forget it you better
[01:27.83]Count your last blessings
[01:29.01]And fill up the wagon
[01:30.20]Chases this fee
[01:31.15]And now I\'m running out of time
[01:36.06]
[01:43.91]My own enemy
[01:46.28]I don\'t hear you now
[01:48.71]Perfect tragedy
[01:51.14]God bless us denial
[01:57.99]
[02:07.07]Misery\'s best friend
