[00:00.00]Now since my baby left me I've found a new place to dwell:
[00:05.00]down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel.
[00:11.00]I'm so lonely baby, I'm so lonely,
[00:17.00]I'm so lonely that I could die.
[01:43.00][00:21.00]And tho' it's always crowded you can still find some room
[01:48.00][00:26.00]for broken hearted lovers to cry there in the gloom
[01:54.00][00:31.00]and be so lonely baby, oh so lonely,
[01:59.00][00:36.00]oh so lonely they could die.
[00:41.00]The bell hop's tears keep flowing, the desk clerk's dressed in black.
[00:46.00]They been so long on Lonely Sreet they never will go back
[00:51.00]and they're so lonely baby, oh they're so lonely,
[00:57.00]they're so lonely they pray to die.
[01:02.00]So if your baby leaves and you have a tale to tell
[01:06.00]just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel
[01:11.00]where you'll be lonely and I'll be lonely,
[01:17.00]we'll be so lonely that we could die.
