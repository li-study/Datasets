New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
New New York Skyline
Wounds they heal in time
Don't crawl and don't despair
It's a new New York Today
I look across these city streets
My heart is numb, it still beats
Nothing to say
There's nothing to say
I look across this empty room
My heart is still in bloom
There's nothing to say
I only can pray
New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
New New York Skyline
Wounds they heal in time
Don't crawl and don't despair
It's a new New York Today
I look across these city streets
My heart is cold it beats
30th of may
Ground zero today
New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah
I get down on my knees and pray
For the heroes of the day
And no comfort I can find
For the loved ones left behind
They won't tear us apart
They won't tear us apart
They won't tear us apart
They won't tear us apart
No way
New day
New day
