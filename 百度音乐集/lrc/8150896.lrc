[00:32.06]Carry me away from
[00:35.46]this dark and lonely room
[00:40.01]Light me in your arms
[00:43.16]all I want to know is you
[00:48.02]Chase away the darkness
[00:51.53]with everything you are
[00:56.04]I will find my strengh
[00:59.08]in the beat of your heart
[01:08.07]Picture book of memories
[01:12.16]how we used to be
[01:15.57]Some people spend a lifetime
[01:20.14]waiting for their dreams
[01:23.95]But I don't find the answers
[01:27.61]by looking at the stars
[01:32.25]I can find my strengh
[01:35.19]in the beat of your heart
[01:40.26]Time held in our hands
[01:45.63]will change into years
[01:51.89]gone by
[01:56.24]If I can hold on to you
[02:02.26]I'll leave all my fears behind
[02:12.43]Holding on we drift
[02:15.30]like two flowers on the sea
[02:20.31]Riding on the waves
[02:23.37]lefting go of what will be
[02:28.40]I won't find the answers
[02:31.74]by staring at the stars
[02:36.51]I've found all my dreams
[02:39.45]in the beat of your heart
[02:44.44]I've found all my dreams
[02:47.44]in the beat beat of your heart
