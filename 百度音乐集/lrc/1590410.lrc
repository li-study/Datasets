[00:36.94]One snap for the dieing
[00:39.31]One click to end the day
[00:41.93]Another story with a mangled scene
[00:43.93]It couldn't happen any other way
[00:46.60]
[00:47.61]You wanna talk about it?
[00:50.00]I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
[00:54.51]Watch the clock 'til you unwind
[00:57.89]You wanna cry about it?
[01:00.36]It's making me just sentimental, lost my mind
[01:04.77]The way I see, you must be blind
[01:07.88]
[01:08.61]So this is the world you left behind
[01:13.83]This is the guilt that consumes you
[01:17.30]
[01:17.80]So die alone
[01:21.90]This is the one thing that I won't do
[01:27.68]So say your prayers
[01:32.44]Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[01:37.53]
[01:51.76]Can't bribe me with money
[01:54.51]Can't shower me with shame
[01:57.11]Another killer from a broken home
[01:59.32]Until you come on me with many things
[02:02.26]
[02:03.01]You wanna know about it?
[02:05.16]Well I'mma be fucking with you every time
[02:09.70]Story broken, you're behind
[02:13.09]Yeah when you ask about it?
[02:15.64]You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
[02:20.09]Seems we all have friends to find
[02:23.00]
[02:23.78]So this is the hate I've been born to
[02:29.09]Full of the tales of the untrue
[02:32.40]
[02:33.08]So die alone
[02:37.08]This is one thing that I won't do
[02:42.72]So say your prayers
[02:47.72]Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[02:52.93]
[03:17.70]And I'm waiting
[03:20.43]Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
[03:25.43](And all the promises I'll find)
[03:28.12]Don't hesitated, you've pulled the trigger
[03:32.25]Now your story's left behind
[03:35.80](I know you want to see me cry,)
[03:40.67]Lock my soul you hope to burn
[03:45.54]
[04:24.20]So die alone
[04:28.43]This is the one thing that I won't do
[04:34.31]So say your prayers
[04:39.30]Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[04:44.23]
[04:45.27]To die unknown
[04:49.67]Would crush the fish-lens we all see through
[04:55.33]To care the glare
[05:00.07]Expose the ugliness we hold true
[05:05.50]
