[00:04.65]Golden Brown
[00:07.20]
[00:21.81]Golden brown texture like sun
[00:24.75]Lays me down with my mind she runs
[00:29.14]Throughout the night
[00:30.66]No need to fight
[00:32.58]Never a frown with golden brown
[00:40.97]Every time just like the last
[00:43.91]On her ship tied to the mast
[00:47.85]To distant lands
[00:49.93]Takes both my hands
[00:52.17]Never a frown with golden brown
[01:19.60]Golden brown finer temptress
[01:20.68]Through the ages she\'s heading west
[01:23.86]From far away
[01:25.69]Stays for a day
[01:27.66]Never a frown with golden brown
[02:56.96]Never a frown
[03:03.45]With golden brown
[03:05.14]Never a frown
[03:06.22]With golden brown
[03:09.79]Repeat
