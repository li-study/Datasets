[00:00.08]Something'about out your eyes
[00:04.02]That I can not forget
[00:07.17]Something about out your smile
[00:10.39]Makes it hard for me to sleep at night
[00:14.16]Something about me
[00:18.52]Does't  work like normally
[00:21.08]Something about you
[00:24.15]That can't hold on to
[00:28.88]
[01:38.33][00:29.18]Am I waiting in vain?
[01:41.65][00:32.58]Do I deserve this pain?
[01:45.44][00:36.49]When will i see you again?
[01:49.74][00:40.64]Why did you talk to me ?that day
[01:56.55][00:47.31]Why did you say those things? that day
[02:03.32][00:53.67]Why did you come to me ?then walk away
[01:01.11]When there was something in the air
[01:05.12]Something in the way I meet you that day
[01:09.92]
[01:10.61]Still can feel the way you looked at me
[01:16.32]And I wonder how you stole my heart completely
[01:23.57]Something in the way you would hold my hand
[01:30.44]That I believe that fate will bring you back to me again
[02:10.74]When there was something, something in the air
[02:16.90]
[02:18.69]A guy like you belongs to somebody else
[02:25.09]A guy like you will never come back again
[02:31.08]Do you think of me now
[02:34.43]Do you ever wonder how
[02:37.35]We can meet again, meet again?
[02:43.06]
[02:43.92]Why did you talk to me ?that day
[02:50.10]Why did you say those things ?that day
[02:57.21]Why can I not forget that day
[03:04.23]Why can I not find words to say
[03:10.88]Why did you come to me ?then walk away
[03:18.05]When there was something in the air
[03:22.17]Something in the way I met you that day
[03:29.26]
