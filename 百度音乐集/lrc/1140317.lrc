[00:15.50]When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,
[00:22.50]we used to love while others used to play.
[00:31.50]Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,
[00:38.00]some one else moved in from far away.
[00:46.50]Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,
[00:53.50]and you don't ask the time of day.
[01:00.50]But you and I, our love will never die,
[01:07.50]but guess we'll cry come first of May.
[01:17.50]The apple tree that grew for you and me,
[01:26.50]I watched the apples falling one by one.
[01:31.50]And I recall the moment of them all,
[01:39.50]the day I kissed your cheek and you were gone.
[01:47.50]Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,
[01:54.50]and you don't ask the time of day.
[02:01.50]But you and I, our love will never die,
[02:09.50]but guess we'll cry come first of May.

[02:18.47]When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,
[02:26.05]do do do do do do do do do...
[02:34.73]Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,
[02:42.33]some one else moved in from far away.
