[00:06.18]Bjork
[00:07.58]Innocence
[00:18.16]I once had no fears
[00:20.41]None at all
[00:22.40]And then when
[00:24.41]I had some
[00:26.37]To my surprise
[00:28.39]I grew to like both
[00:30.65]Scared or brave
[00:32.67]Without them
[00:34.83]The thrill of fear
[00:38.71]Thought I'd never admit it
[00:43.54]The thrill of fear
[00:47.30]Now greatly enjoyed with courage
[00:51.70]When I once was
[00:53.59]Untouchable
[00:55.51]Innocence roared
[00:57.63]Still amazes
[01:00.04]When I once was
[01:01.94]Innocent
[01:03.87]It's still here
[01:05.80]But in different places
[01:15.88]Neurosis
[01:18.33]Only
[01:20.47]Attaches
[01:22.37]Itself to
[01:24.63]Fertile
[01:26.45]Ground
[01:28.58]Where it can flourish
[01:32.98]The thrill of fear
[01:36.65]Thought I'd never admit it
[01:40.90]The thrill of fear
[01:44.77]Now greatly enjoyed with courage
[01:48.84]When I once was
[01:51.10]Fearless
[01:53.20]Innocence roared
[01:55.11]Still amazes
[01:57.54]Untouchable
[01:59.43]Innocence
[02:01.54]It's still here
[02:03.35]But in different places
[02:04.92]Fear is a powerful drug
[02:13.82]Overcome it and
[02:17.36]You think that you can do
[02:26.28]Anything!
[02:43.79]Should I
[02:45.71]Save myself
[02:47.58]For later
[02:51.60]Or generously give?
[02:59.67]Fear of
[03:01.80]Losing
[03:03.84]Energy
[03:05.78]Is draining
[03:07.64]It locks up your chest
[03:09.84]Shuts down the heart
[03:11.80]Miserly
[03:13.91]And stingy
[03:15.82]Let's open up : share!
[03:24.58]When I once was
[03:26.11]Fearless
[03:28.27]Innocence roared
[03:30.18]Still amazes
[03:32.51]Untouchable
[03:34.20]Innocence
[03:36.33]It's still here
[03:38.24]But in different places
