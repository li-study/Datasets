[00:03.27]Sara Bareilles
[00:05.81]
[00:09.26]Head under the water
[00:11.86]And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
[00:16.74]The breathing gets harder, even I know that
[00:24.72]Made room for me but it’s too soon to see
[00:29.38]If I’m happy in your hands
[00:32.51]I’m unusually hard to hold on to
[00:40.55]Blank stares at blank pages
[00:44.17]No easy way to say this
[00:48.18]You mean well, but you make this hard on me
[00:53.79]I'm not gonna write you a love song
[00:56.75]'Cause you asked for it
[00:58.74]'Cause you need one, you see
[01:01.87]I'm not gonna write you a love song
[01:04.59]'Cause you tell me it's
[01:06.61]Make or breaking this
[01:08.58]If you’re on your way
[01:10.55]I'm not gonna write you to stay
[01:15.39]If all you have is leaving,I need a better reason to write you
[01:20.49]A love song
[01:22.39]Today
[01:23.21]
[01:26.42]Today,yeah...
[01:31.18]I learned the hard way
[01:33.76]That they all say things you wanna hear
[01:38.75]My heavy heart sinks deep down under you
[01:46.67]And your twisted words, your help just hurts
[01:51.30]You are not what I thought you were
[01:55.34]Hello to high and dry
[02:02.60]Convinced me to please you
[02:06.10]Made me think that I need this too
[02:10.10]I’m trying to let you hear me as I am
[02:15.79]I'm not gonna write you a love song
[02:18.68]'Cause you asked for it
[02:20.73]'Cause you need one, you see
[02:23.70]I'm not gonna write you a love song
[02:26.50]'Cause you tell me
[02:28.54]Make or breaking this
[02:30.58]If you’re on your way
[02:32.66]I'm not gonna write you to stay
[02:36.72]If all you have is leaving
[02:39.25]I need a better reason to write you a love song today
[02:46.19]Promise me you'll leave the light on
[02:53.56]To help me see,daylight my guide gone
[03:01.21]'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me because I say
[03:07.88]I won't write you a love song
[03:11.43]'Cause you asked for it
[03:13.48]'Cause you need one you see
[03:16.41]I'm not gonna write you a love song
[03:19.23]'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
[03:23.54]Is that why you wanted a love song
[03:27.02]'Cause you asked for it
[03:29.01]'Cause you need one you see
[03:32.04]I’m not gonna write you a love song
[03:34.80]'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
[03:38.92]If you’re on your way
[03:40.78]I’m not gonna write you to stay
[03:44.98]If your heart is nowhere in it
[03:47.16]I don’t want it for a minute
[03:49.22]Babe, I’ll walk the seven seas when I believe that there's a reason to
[03:53.02]Write you a love song
