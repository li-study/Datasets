[00:02.81]能把pop推嚮無底的深淵的力量
[00:04.52]
[00:05.80]rock'n'roll
[00:07.10]
[00:34.51]Catch your breath,
[00:37.56]Hit the wall,
[00:40.89]Scream out loud,
[00:43.95]As you start to crawl
[00:47.22]Back in your cage
[00:50.87]The only place
[00:53.85]Where they will
[00:57.30]Leave you alone.
[01:01.03]'Cause the weak will
[01:03.50]Seek the weaker til they've broken them.
[01:06.75]Could you get it back again?
[01:10.07]Would it be the same?
[01:14.78]Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
[01:20.28]Left you with no defense;
[01:24.04]They tore it down.
[01:26.68]
[01:27.55](Chorus):
[01:31.53]And I have felt the same as you,
[01:39.26]I've felt the same as you,
[01:46.78]I've felt the same.
[01:50.81]
[02:02.45]Locked inside
[02:05.32]The only place
[02:08.76]Where you feel sheltered,
[02:12.10]Where you feel safe.
[02:15.28]You lost yourself
[02:18.46]In your search to find
[02:22.02]Something else to hide behind.
[02:28.48]
[02:29.09]The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
[02:34.68]Did they see the consequence,
[02:38.09]when they pushed you around?
[02:42.45]The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
[02:48.16]Breaking them 'til they've become just another crown.
[02:56.46]
[02:59.46]And I have felt the same as you,
[03:08.42]I've felt the same as you,
[03:14.55]I've felt the same.
[03:26.67]
[03:27.22]Refuse to feel anything at all,
[03:33.28]Refuse to slip,
[03:36.53]Refuse to fall.
[03:40.04]Can't be weak,
[03:43.54]Can't stand still,
[03:46.77]You watch your back 'cause no one will.
[03:54.05]You don't know why they had to go this far,
[03:59.30]Traded your worth for these scars,
[04:02.46]For your only company.
[04:07.03]And don't believe the lies
[04:09.69]That they have told to you. Not one word was true
[04:16.49]you're alright, you're alright, you're alright.
[04:22.02]
[04:24.19]And I have felt the same as you,
[04:32.76]I've felt the same as you,
[04:38.96]I've felt the same.
[05:00.82]
