[00:11.52]You're everywhere and nowhere, baby,
[00:15.16]that's where you're at
[00:18.87]Going down the bumpy hillside in your hippie hat
[00:26.32]Flying across the country and getting fat
[00:33.62]Saying everything is groovy
[00:37.80]when your tires are flat
[00:40.20]
[00:40.36]And it's hi-ho silver lining
[00:45.24]anywhere you go now, baby
[00:48.94]I see your sun is shining but I will make a fuss
[00:55.72]Though it's obvious
[00:58.08]
[00:59.48]Flies are in your pea soup, baby
[01:02.90]they're waving at me
[01:06.60]Anything you want is yours now,
[01:10.09]only nothing's for free
[01:13.88]Life's a-gonna get you someday,
[01:17.57]just wait and see
[01:20.96]So put up your beach umbrella
[01:24.83]while you're watching TV
[01:26.81]
[01:27.57]And it's hi-ho silver lining
[01:33.04]anywhere you go, well, baby
[01:36.40]I see your sun is shining but I will make a fuss
[01:42.86]Though it's obvious
[01:45.20]......
[02:15.11]And it's hi-ho silver lining
[02:19.72]anywhere you go, well, baby
[02:23.53]I see your sun is shining but I will make a fuss
[02:29.91]Though it's obvious
[02:33.08]And it's hi-ho silver lining
[02:37.92]anywhere you go, well, baby
[02:41.62]I see your sun is shining but I will make a fuss
