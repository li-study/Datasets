[00:03.88]Your Song
[00:05.10]Music by Elton John
[00:05.69]
[00:06.18]Available on the album Elton John
[00:10.43]It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
[00:16.84]I'm not one of those who can easily hide
[00:25.13]I don't have much money but boy if I did
[00:31.37]I'd buy a big house where we both could live
[00:41.40]If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
[00:48.31]Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
[00:55.49]I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
[01:02.78]My gift is my song and this one's for you
[02:56.82][01:12.27]And you can tell everybody this is your song
[03:06.37][01:19.84]It may be quite simple but now that it's done
[03:32.14][03:12.69][01:27.73]I hope you don't mind
[03:33.44][03:15.04][01:30.33]I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[03:39.07][03:21.99][01:35.01]How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[01:54.69]I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
[02:02.05]Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
[02:08.91]But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
[02:16.13]It's for people like you that keep it turned on
[02:26.55]So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
[02:33.93]You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
[02:41.28]Anyway the thing is what I really mean
[02:47.32]Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
