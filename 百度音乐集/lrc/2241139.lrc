[00:02.09]
[00:13.47]I used to rule the world
[00:17.16]Seas would rise when I gave the word
[00:19.81]Now in the morning I sweep alone
[00:24.07]Sweep the streets I used to own
[00:27.53]
[00:41.18]I used to roll the dice
[00:44.84]Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
[00:47.94]Listen as the crowd would sing
[00:52.12]Now the old king is dead Long live the king!"
[00:54.85]One minute I held the key
[00:58.85]Next the walls were closed on me
[01:01.59]And I discovered that my castles stand
[01:05.82]Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
[01:08.74]
[01:09.58]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
[01:13.29]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[01:16.78]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[01:20.22]My missionaries in a foreign field
[01:23.71]For some reason I can't explain
[01:27.22]Once you go there was never, never an honest word
[01:33.84]That was when I ruled the world
[01:37.41]
[01:50.24]It was the wicked and wild wind
[01:54.49]Blew down the doors to let me in
[01:57.31]Shattered windows and the sound of drums
[02:01.71]People couldn't believe what I'd become
[02:04.80]Revolutionaries wait
[02:08.55]For my head on a silver plate
[02:11.47]Just a puppet on a lonely string
[02:15.54]Oh who would ever want to be king?
[02:19.36]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
[02:22.96]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[02:26.36]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[02:29.79]My missionaries in a foreign field
[02:33.21]For some reason I can't explain
[02:36.74]I know Saint Peter will call my name
[02:39.87]Never an honest word
[02:43.27]But that was when I ruled the world
[02:47.13]
[02:59.95](Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
[03:15.12]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
[03:18.52]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[03:22.02]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[03:25.37]My missionaries in a foreign field
[03:28.87]For some reason I can't explain
[03:32.42]I know Saint Peter will call my name
[03:35.58]Never an honest word
[03:38.91]But that was when I ruled the world
[03:42.25]
[03:42.93]Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh
