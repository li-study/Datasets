[00:01.18]You Could Be Happy

[00:16.63]You could be happy and I won't know
[00:24.54]But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
[00:31.16]
[00:33.28]And all the things that I wished I had not said
[00:41.81]Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head
[00:49.33]
[00:50.62]Is it too late to remind you how we were
[00:58.19]But not our last days of silent screaming blur
[01:05.45]
[01:07.73]Most of what I remember makes me sure
[01:14.35]I should have stopped you from walking out the door
[01:23.47]
[01:25.67]You could be happy, I hope you are
[01:33.78]You made me happier than I'd been by far
[01:40.90]
[01:42.46]Somehow everything I own smells of you
[01:50.75]And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
[01:57.79]
[01:59.70]Do the things that you always wanted to
[02:08.37]Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
[02:15.12]
[02:17.07]More than anything I want to see you, girl
[02:25.59]Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
