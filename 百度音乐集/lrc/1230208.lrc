[ti:Where The Streets Have No Name]

[al:]
[01:47]I want to run
[01:50]I want to hide
[01:54]I want to tear down the walls
[01:58]That hold me inside
[02:02]I want to reach out
[02:05]And touch the flame
[03:52][03:48][03:42][02:51][02:47][02:40][02:10]Where the streets have no name
[02:17]I want to feel, sunlight on my face
[02:25]See that dust cloud disappear without a trace
[02:32]I want to take shelter from the poison rain
[03:56][02:54]We're still building
[03:57][02:56]Then burning down love, burning down love
[04:04][03:03]And when I go there
[04:08][03:06]I go there with you...
[04:11][03:10]It's all I can do
[03:18]The cities a flood
[04:15][03:21]And our love turns to rust
[04:19][03:25]We're beaten and blown by the wind
[03:30]Trampled into dust
[03:33]I'll show you a place
[03:37]High on the desert plain
