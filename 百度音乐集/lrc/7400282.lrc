[00:01.22]Judas Priest-Before the dawn
[00:10.82]
[00:19.67]Before the dawn
[00:24.16]I hear you whisper
[00:29.31]In your sleep "don't let the morning take him"
[00:37.93]Outside the birds begin to call
[00:47.50]As if to summon up my leaving
[00:58.44]It's been a lifetime
[01:02.79]Since I found someone
[01:07.47]Since I found someonewho would stay
[01:16.55]I've waited too long
[01:21.73]and now you're leaving
[01:25.87]Oh please don't take it all away
[01:37.05]
[02:13.48]It's been a lifetime
[02:18.03]since I found someone
[02:22.40]since I found someonewho would stay
[02:31.74]I've waited too long
[02:36.46]and now you're leaving
[02:40.81]Oh please don't take it all away
[02:49.98]Before the dawn
[02:54.27]I hear you whisper
[02:59.08]In your sleep "don't let the morning take him"
