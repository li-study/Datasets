[00:10.24]You say the things you feel are right
[00:14.89]But I feel those things are wrong
[00:17.59]And for that we fight all night long
[00:22.37]There you go
[00:23.74]Trippin' on the things I say
[00:26.05]'Cause things ain't going your way

[01:45.01]'Cause you're the best I've ever known
[01:48.14]So tell me just how long it's gonna take to be
[01:52.46]Happy every day and every night just like we should
[01:57.53]'Cause to be happy with you all my life I know I could
[02:03.97]What must I do
[02:05.79]Do to make you trust in me
[02:08.26]Is that a possibility

[03:02.00]We'll put the past behind
[03:04.23]Let's not waste no time
[03:07.19]We can do it ohh all night
