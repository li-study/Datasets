[00:21.50]At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops with him on top
[00:28.50]Lemin yellow sun, arms raised in a V
[00:35.50]And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

[03:05.50]Jeremy spoke in class today, Jeremy spoke in class today...
[03:23.50]Jeremy spoke in, spoke in, Jeremy spoke in, spoke in...
