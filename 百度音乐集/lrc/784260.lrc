[00:00.00]The Vines - Braindead
[00:02.00]
[00:07.90]I want the world around me
[00:14.38]For it to be gone
[00:18.19]And it to be free
[00:22.08]
[00:25.70]Dead in the brain
[00:29.80]Is your claim to fame
[00:33.65]I live by the sound
[00:37.53]
[00:38.56]Thinkin' enough about it
[00:45.96]The spirit is gone
[00:49.28]In what I believe
[00:53.03]
[00:57.52]Dead in the brain
[01:00.92]Is your claim to fame
[01:04.88]I live by the sound
[01:08.97]
[01:09.96]Out in a dream
[01:12.05]When I feel sorrow
[01:17.21]Try make believin anyway
[01:25.78]
[01:43.15]Dead in the brain
[01:47.30]Is your claim to fame
[01:51.26]I live by the sound
[01:55.18]And nobody else
[02:00.55]
