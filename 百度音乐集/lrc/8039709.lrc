[00:09.60]Break through the undertow,
[00:11.97]your hands I can't seem to find,
[00:14.25]pollution burns my tongue,
[00:16.48]cough words I can't speak so I
[00:18.60]stop my struggling,
[00:21.25]then I float to the surface,
[00:23.28]fill my lungs with air,
[00:25.80]then let it out
[00:27.30]I give it all,
[00:31.81]now there's a reason why I sing,
[00:36.50]So give it all,
[00:41.15]and it's these reasons that belong to me
[00:45.74]
[00:49.33]Rock bottoms where we live,
[00:51.77]and still we dig these trenches,
[00:53.87]to bury ourselves in them,
[00:56.02]backs breaking under tension
[00:58.53]For far too long these voices,
[01:00.92]muffled by distances,
[01:03.02]it's time to come to our senses,
[01:05.40]up from the dirt
[01:07.02]We give it all,
[01:11.23]now there's a reason why I sing,
[01:16.07]So give it all,
[01:20.46]and it's these reasons that belong to me
[01:26.14]Breathe (breathe),
[01:27.37]the air we give (give),
[01:29.58]the life we live (live),
[01:31.77]our pulses racing distances, (breathe)
[01:36.52]so wet my tongue (give),
[01:38.84]break into song (live),
[01:41.19]through seas of competition
[01:45.17]So please believe your eyes, a sacrifice,
[01:50.47]is not what we had in our minds,
[01:54.61]I'm coming home tonight, home tonight
[02:02.26]We give it all,
[02:07.22]now there's a reason why I sing,
[02:11.99]So give it all,
[02:16.78]and it's these reasons that belong to me
[02:21.58]Today I offer all myself to this
[02:26.07]I'm living for my dying wish,
[02:30.62]I give it all,
[02:35.32]now there's a reason,
[02:37.65]there's a reason,
[02:39.74]to give it all
