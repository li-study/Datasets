[00:14.29]Song: Northern Sky Lyrics
[00:22.30]I never felt magic crazy as this
[00:27.51]I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
[00:32.67]I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
[00:37.63]Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
[00:42.15]But now you're here
[00:45.75]Brighten my northern sky.
[00:59.02]I've been a long time that I'm waiting
[01:04.85]Been a long that I'm blown
[01:10.22]I've been a long time that I've wandered
[01:14.84]Through the people I have known
[01:18.75]Oh, if you would and you could
[01:23.29]Straighten my new mind's eye
[01:28.44]
[02:16.21]Would you love me for my money
[02:21.86]Would you love me for my head
[02:26.81]Would you love me through the winter
[02:32.02]Would you love me 'til I'm dead
[02:36.40]Oh, if you would and you could
[02:39.60]Come blow your horn on high.
[02:53.17]I never felt magic crazy as this
[02:59.02]I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
[03:03.97]I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
[03:09.19]Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
[03:13.75]But now you're here
[03:18.01]Brighten my northern sky
