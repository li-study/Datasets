[00:04.13]词曲：张悬
[00:06.10]演唱：张悬
[00:09.06]
[00:26.91]也不是真的不要关心
[00:29.15]也不是真的不曾介意
[00:31.70]可偏我也不是真的拒绝这一切
[00:35.94]只留下自己
[00:38.46]也不是全都不理不听
[00:40.75]也不是真的无从继续
[00:43.37]可每一次我都试着坚强　
[00:46.79]都成不得已的哭泣
[00:51.35]I'm screaming, I'm losing all of it
[00:56.58]I'm trying to be mature someday
[00:59.80]but  'till now it's still in vain
[01:03.09]I'm bearing, I'm losing all of it
[01:08.05]I'm trying to go on this path
[01:11.02]but you said I haven't get the jest
[01:14.41]
[01:41.37]也不是真的不要关心
[01:43.55]也不是真的想尽办法任性
[01:46.61]而你懂不懂 我懂不懂
[01:49.62]其实我心底都珍惜
[01:52.98]也不是真的不理不听
[01:55.29]也不是硬要对方疏离
[01:57.90]可每一次我的试着靠近
[02:01.20]都成了你看见的抗议
[02:05.96]I'm screaming, I'm losing all of it
[02:11.00]I'm trying to be prefect someday
[02:14.32]but 'till now it's still in vain
[02:17.19]I'm  bearing, I'm losing all of it
[02:22.58]I'm trying to be understood
[02:25.73]but you said I haven't had seen it yet
[02:30.82]I'm screaming, I'm losing all of it
[02:35.91]I'm trying to go on this path
[02:39.24]but you said I haven't get the jest
[02:44.24]I'm losing all of it
[02:47.24]I'm trying to be understood
[02:50.85]but you said I haven't see the point
[02:55.69]I'm try it out, I'll try it out
[02:59.36]I'm trying it out sometime
[03:03.96]I'm trying it out someday
