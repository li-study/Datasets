[00:00.00]The Longest Time-Billy Joel
[00:00.34]
[00:00.54]Oh, oh, oh
[00:05.79]For the longest time
[00:08.83]Oh, oh, oh
[00:11.63]For the longest time
[00:13.56]If you said goodbye to me tonight
[00:18.84]There would still be music left to write
[00:24.95]What else could I do
[00:27.91]Im so inspired by you
[00:30.72]That hasnt happened for the longest time
[00:35.87]
[00:36.33]Once I thought my innocence was gone
[00:41.72]Now I know that happiness goes on
[00:47.78]Thats where you found me
[00:50.40]When you put your arms around me
[00:53.67]I havent been there for the longest time
[00:58.62]
[00:58.97]Oh, oh, oh
[01:03.24]For the longest time
[01:06.10]Oh, oh, oh
[01:08.87]For the longest time
[01:10.66]Im that voice youre hearing in the hall
[01:16.00]And the greatest miracle of all
[01:22.07]Is how I need you
[01:25.10]And how you needed me too
[01:28.03]That hasnt happened for the longest time
[01:33.21]
[01:33.54]Maybe this wont last very long
[01:39.02]But you feel so right
[01:41.71]And I could be wrong
[01:44.75]Maybe Ive been hoping too hard
[01:50.38]But Ive gone this far
[01:52.56]And its more than I hoped for
[01:54.94]
[01:56.20]Who knows how much further well go on
[02:01.73]Maybe Ill be sorry when youre gone
[02:07.63]Ill take my chances
[02:10.26]I forgot how nice romance is
[02:13.30]I havent been there for the longest time
[02:18.64]
[02:18.90]I had second thoughts at the start
[02:24.25]I said to myself
[02:27.19]Hold on to your heart
[02:31.02]Now I know the woman that you are
[02:35.26]Youre wonderful so far
[02:37.59]And its more than I hoped for
[02:40.94]
[02:41.21]I dont care what consequence it brings
[02:46.55]I have been a fool for lesser things
[02:52.54]I want you so bad
[02:55.45]I think you ought to know that
[02:58.42]I intend to hold you for the longest time
[03:03.51]
[03:03.74]Oh, oh, oh
[03:07.78]For the longest time
[03:10.69]Oh, oh, oh
[03:13.46]For the longest time
[03:17.02]Oh, oh, oh
[03:19.12]For the longest time
[03:22.07]Oh, oh, oh
[03:24.90]For the longest time
