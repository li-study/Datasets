[12:38.225]Frente! - Reflect
[08:59.332]
[04:44.691]Look, look in the mirror
[01:19.137]For the bounce and spark
[04:52.372]Of the butt you've thrown
[15:34.083]Don't turn around
[15:54.829]You're a long way from home
[00:56.993]
[03:06.012]When we are together
[01:19.064]We journey to the sea
[01:23.173]And I am always at the wheel
[01:19.904]Well that's what you say to me
[14:31.467]And can you tell me
[13:42.497]When we reach the water
[16:31.069]And can you tell me
[08:09.685]When my face is wet
[13:43.969]
[07:41.183]Look, look in the mirror
[00:40.735]For the bounce and spark
[10:25.874]Of the butt you've thrown
[05:07.905]Don't turn around
[05:04.929]You're a long way from home
[01:28.695]
[04:43.358]You look in my wardrobe
[01:15.071]And tell me what I've done
[13:33.913]You say that my mind
[01:25.558]Is as dark as trodden boards
[11:43.625]You say I don't understand
[11:18.760]But at least I know it
[17:28.054]Do you see yourself in me
[04:30.997]And hide away in fright?
[05:16.101]
[02:58.325]Look, look in the mirror
[14:37.355]For the bounce and spark
[05:10.950]Of the butt you've thrown
[13:45.629]Don't turn around
[16:00.822]You're a long way
[09:42.076]You're a long way
[09:03.913]You're a long, long way from home
[06:57.347]
