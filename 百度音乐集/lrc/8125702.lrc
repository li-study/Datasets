[00:11.45]
[00:14.95]I gotta take a little time,
[00:19.12]a little time to think things over
[00:23.14]I better read between the lines,
[00:32.08]in case I need it when I'm older.
[00:43.02]Now this mountain I must climb,
[00:54.30]feels like the world upon my shoulders
[01:00.49]Through the clouds I see love shine,
[01:04.65]it keeps me warm as life grows colder
[01:10.21]In my life there's been heartache and pain
[01:16.91]I don't know if I can face it again
[01:23.01]Can't stop now, I've travelled so far,
[01:28.23] to change this lonely life
[02:53.74][01:35.11]I want to know what love is,
[02:59.82][01:41.61]I want you to show me
[03:05.61][01:47.33]I want to feel what love is,
[03:11.67][01:53.35]I know you can show me
[02:00.55]Oh oh..............
[02:08.70]I'm gonna take a little time,
[02:12.77]a little time to look around me
[02:18.79]I've got nowhere left to hide,
[02:22.98]It looks like love has finally found me
[02:28.15]In my life there's been heartache and pain
[02:35.32]I don't know if I can face it again
[02:41.45]Can't stop now, I've travelled so far,
[02:46.63] to change this lonely life
[03:17.40]I want to know what love is,
[03:23.72] I want you to show me
[03:29.24]I want to feel what love is,
[03:35.21] I know you can show me
[03:41.66]Let's talk about love -
[03:43.88] I want to know what love is
[03:46.92]The love that you feel inside -
[03:50.26]I want you to show me
[03:53.71]And I'm feeling so much love -
