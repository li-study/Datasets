[00:08.82]Won't someone tell me what is happening to me?
[00:12.74]Why am I so misunderstood why can't they see?
[00:16.99]Now I'm caught between the devil and the angel that I used to be
[00:24.77]They say I'll understand it all in good time
[00:28.68]But age ain't nothing but a number in my mind

[00:36.43]Caught between wrong and right
[00:40.16]
[00:40.73]I wanna give into the woman in me
[00:44.26]I wanna be someone they don't want me to be
[00:48.28]The moral of the story is I got no choice
[00:53.11]I must not chase the boys

[01:51.54]
[01:52.13]They could try to make me write a thousand lines
[01:52.37]But that won't ever change the way I feel inside
[01:58.47]They got their opinions but I just don't care
