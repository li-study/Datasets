[00:19.19]Not even a wave
[00:21.47]As she boards the plane
[00:23.38]Looks over her shoulders
[00:25.65]As they closed the gate
[00:27.84]Heart on my sleeve
[00:29.68]Ring in my hand
[00:31.27]Last thing she said
[00:32.45]It's too late you'll never understand
[00:34.57]
[00:35.57]Baby girl bought a one way ticket
[00:37.57]Anywhere far away from me
[00:39.65]No suitcase packed
[00:40.61]Left just like that
[00:41.70]She's gone indefinitely
[00:43.97]If I just had one more chance
[00:45.86]Show you I'm a different man
[00:47.38]
[00:48.37]Now it's too late to see
[00:49.65]
[00:50.74]I would have gave the world to you
[00:54.76]This should have been a trip for two
[00:59.02]When girl I'm at the airport
[01:01.07]With nothing but my passport
[01:03.24]Left me standing here
[01:05.76]Took my heart as a souvenir [x3]
[01:17.15]
[01:18.10]Pulling away
[01:19.71]I'm taking the plane
[01:21.84]Cause you're taking off
[01:23.55]And the sky looks so grey
[01:26.15]You've left me behind
[01:28.02]Here on the ground
[01:29.68]Watching a part of me disappear with you in the clouds
[01:33.89]Baby girl bought a one way ticket
[01:35.77]Anywhere far away from me
[01:37.91]No suitcase packed
[01:39.26]Left just like that
[01:40.22]She's gone indefinitely
[01:42.08]If I just had one more chance
[01:44.15]Show you I'm a different man
[01:46.27]Now it's too late to see
[01:47.88]
[01:49.30]I would have gave the world to you
[01:53.05]This should have been a trip for two
[01:57.14]When girl I'm at the airport
[01:59.64]With nothing but my passport
[02:01.70]Left me standing here
[02:03.23]
[02:04.39]Took my heart as a souvenir [x3]
[02:15.37]
[02:16.27]You're flying away
[02:18.29]Into the sky
[02:20.52]I'm feeling so empty deep inside
[02:23.85]
[02:25.45]But if I'll never have you here
[02:27.88]
[02:29.81]Keep my heart as a souvenir
[02:32.29]
[02:39.19]I would have gave the world to you
[02:43.36]This should have been a trip for two
[02:47.86]When girl I'm at the airport
[02:49.66]With nothing but my passport
[02:51.71]Left me standing here
[02:53.19]
[02:55.00]Took my heart as a souvenir [x3]
[03:04.77]
[03:06.42]Not even a wave
[03:08.24]As she boards the plane
[03:10.31]Looks over her shoulders
[03:12.98]As they closed the gate
[03:14.86]
