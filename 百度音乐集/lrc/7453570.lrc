[00:03.56]Woah oh oh ohhh
[00:06.48]
[00:09.53]I had a dream last night
[00:11.11]I didn't know which floor to get off on, heyyyeyy
[00:18.21]The doors, they opened on 4 and 5 and 6
[00:21.60]And you were gone, all gone
[00:25.89]
[00:27.13]I didn't understand
[00:29.36]I didn't wanna know
[00:31.16]At least I took a chance
[00:33.67]I had to let it go
[00:35.59]
[00:36.07]Elevator goes up
[00:38.06]Elevator come down
[00:39.41]And you just go with the flow
[00:41.53]Until your feet are back on the ground
[00:43.82]It's an endless ride
[00:46.36]Sometimes it takes you up
[00:47.93]Sometimes it tears you down inside
[00:52.39]But it's the butterflies
[00:55.51]That keep you feeling so alive, so alive
[00:59.68]You gotta get back that high
[01:02.05]
[01:02.52]And in my dream last night
[01:04.07]The doors they finally shut and I was there, somewhere
[01:10.96]Alone in my reality inside an empty box
[01:14.65]That's filled with air
[01:16.80]But I don't care, noooo
[01:19.15]
[01:19.91]Next time I'll get it right
[01:22.15]Next time I'll be okay
[01:24.27]I'll have a different dream tonight
[01:26.63]Tomorrow's another day
[01:28.48]
[01:28.94]Elevator goes up (elevator goes up)
[01:30.92]Elevator come down
[01:32.47]And you just go with the flow
[01:34.50]Until your feet are back on the ground
[01:36.66]It's an endless ride
[01:39.26]Sometimes it takes you up
[01:40.78]Sometimes it tears you down inside
[01:45.27]But it's the butterflies
[01:48.59]That keep you feeling so alive, so alive
[01:52.07]You gotta get back that high
[01:54.75]
[01:55.35]You'll never know
[01:57.56]What you're gonna get
[01:59.59]What you don't expect will come and find you
[02:04.09]If you laugh or cry
[02:06.34]If you run and hide
[02:08.77]But it's all right
[02:38.38][02:12.51]
[02:39.23][02:13.04]Elevator goes up
[02:41.41][02:14.95]Elevator come down
[02:42.77][02:16.49]And you just go with the flow
[02:44.93][02:18.44]Until your feet are back on the ground
[02:47.29][02:21.01]It's an endless ride
[02:49.77][02:23.30]Sometimes it takes you up
[02:51.28][02:24.83]Sometimes it tears you down inside
[02:55.75][02:29.34]But it's the butterflies
[02:58.62][02:32.99]That keep you feeling so alive, so alive
[03:02.99][02:36.62]You gotta get back that high
