[00:02.00]The Script - I'm Yours
[00:07.00]
[00:17.97]You touch these tired eyes of mine
[00:24.04]And map my face out line by line,
[00:28.44]And somehow growing old feels fine.
[00:35.92]Listen close for I'm not smart:
[00:41.76]You wrap your thoughts in works of art,
[00:46.39]And they're hanging on the walls of my heart.
[00:52.48]
[00:54.24]I may not have the softest touch;
[00:58.30]I may not say the words as such,
[01:03.11]And though I may not look like much, I'm yours.
[01:11.95]And though my edges may be rough;
[01:16.79]I never feel I'm quite enough;
[01:21.70]It may not seem like very much, but I'm yours.
[01:29.36]
[01:49.05]You healed these scars over time:
[01:55.30]Embraced my soul, you loved my mind.
[01:59.69]You're the only angel in my life.
[02:08.35]The day news came my best friend died,
[02:13.34]my knees went weak; you saw me cry.
[02:17.80]Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes.
[02:24.04]
[02:26.02]I may not have the softest touch;
[02:29.67]I may not say the words as such,
[02:34.67]And though I may not look like much, I'm yours.
[02:43.67]And though my edges may be rough;
[02:48.19]I never feel I'm quite enough;
[02:53.15]It may not seem like very much, but I'm yours.
[03:04.42]
[03:42.63]I may not have the softest touch;
[03:47.65]I may not say the words as such,
[03:52.29]I know I don't fit in that much, but I'm yours.
[04:04.58]
