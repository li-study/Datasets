[00:00.40]Keren Ann - For You And I
[00:32.20]
[00:34.66]Somewhere late at night
[00:39.79]The merman called the breeze
[00:46.15]Found an out of sight
[00:51.17]And simply watched at ease
[00:57.64]The sea was cold as ice
[01:02.58]And lonely as it seems
[01:08.03]The wind came to my eyes
[01:13.96]And woke me from a dream
[01:17.73]
[01:18.71]And it's over now for you and I
[01:25.88]For you and I
[01:29.52]It's over now for you and I
[01:37.78]For you and I
[01:39.74]
[02:08.41]Out there in the sand
[02:13.36]I waited for the dawn
[02:18.94]To bring me thoughts from other lands
[02:24.67]And then you came along
[02:28.28]
[02:29.47]And it's over now for you and I
[02:37.25]For you and I
[02:40.90]It's over now for you and I
[02:49.10]For you and I
[02:51.59]
[03:19.63]Somewhere late at night
[03:24.73]The merman called the breeze
[03:30.03]Found an out of sight
[03:36.42]And simply watched at ease
[03:41.33]
