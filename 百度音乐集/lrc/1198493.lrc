[00:28.83]Fell no pain, but my life aint easy
[00:32.10]I know Im my best friend
[00:35.48]No one cares, but Im so much stronger
[00:38.83]Ill fight until the end
[00:42.45]To escape from the true false world
[00:45.65]Undamaged destiny
[00:49.06]Cant get caught in the endless circle
[00:52.23]Ring of stupidity
[00:54.43]
[00:56.11]Out of my own, out to be free
[01:02.78]One with my mind, they just cant see
[01:09.51]No need to hear things that they say
[01:16.12]Life is for my own to live my own way
[01:22.73]
[01:29.17]Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
[01:32.32]Dont tell my what to do
[01:35.71]I dont care now, cause Im on my side
[01:39.02]And I can see through you
[01:42.73]Feed my brain with your so called standards
[01:45.77]Who says that I aint right
[01:49.14]Break away from your common fashion
[01:52.39]See through your blurry sight
[01:55.02]
[01:56.57]Out of my own, out to be free
[02:03.34]One with my mind, they just cant see
[02:09.98]No need to hear things that they say
[02:16.55]Life is for my own to live my own way
[02:23.16]
[02:29.17]See they try to bring the hammer down
[02:35.57]No damn chains can hold me to the ground
