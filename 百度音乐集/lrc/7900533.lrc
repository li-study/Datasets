[00:11.72]
[00:13.72]Here I am
[00:16.49]Broken wings
[00:19.36]Quiet thoughts
[00:21.96]Unspoken dreams
[00:25.40]Here I am
[00:28.10]Alone again
[00:30.99]And I need her now
[00:33.58]To hold my hand
[00:35.29]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[00:43.04]She\'s the air I breath
[00:47.00]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[00:59.61]
[01:00.33]It\'s the way she makes me feel
[01:03.15]It\'s the only thing that\'s real
[01:06.09]It\'s the way she understands
[01:08.76]She\'s my lover, she\'s my friend
[01:12.17]And when I look into her eyes
[01:14.88]It\'s the way I feel inside
[01:17.86]Like the man I want to be
[01:20.55]She\'s all I\'ll ever need
[01:24.69]
[01:36.02]So much time
[01:38.54]So much pain(but)
[01:41.75]There\'s one thing
[01:44.74]That still remains (it\'s the)
[01:47.53]The way she cared
[01:50.31]The love we shared
[01:53.70]And through it all
[01:55.73]She\'s always been there
[01:57.85]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[02:05.59]In a world so cold, so empty
[02:09.63]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[02:21.98]
[02:22.76]It\'s the way she makes me feel
[02:25.64]It\'s the only thing that\'s real
[02:28.71]It\'s the way she understands
[02:31.30]She\'s my lover, she\'s my friend
[02:34.56]And when I look into her eyes
[02:37.45]It\'s the way I feel inside
[02:40.47]Like the man I want to be
[02:43.13]She\'s all I\'ll ever need
[02:50.45]
[03:08.63]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[03:16.37]The love to make me seen
[03:20.48]She\'s all, she\'s all I ever had
[03:31.92]
[03:33.76]It\'s the way she makes me feel
[03:36.41]It\'s the only thing that\'s real
[03:39.46]It\'s the way she understands
[03:42.09]She\'s my lover, she\'s my friend
[03:45.49]And when I look into her eyes
[03:48.12]It\'s the way I feel inside
[03:51.17]Like the man I want to be
[03:53.96]She\'s all I\'ll ever need
[03:57.42]It\'s the way she makes me feel
