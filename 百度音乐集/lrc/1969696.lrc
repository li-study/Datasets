[00:09.33]I need a sign to let me know you're here
[00:14.75]All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
[00:19.89]I need to know that things are gonna look up
[00:25.37]Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
[00:31.41]When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
[00:38.42]When you can feel the world shake from the words that I said
[00:43.81]And I'm calling all angels
[00:55.30]And I'm calling all you angels
[01:07.43]And I won't give up if you don't give up
[01:13.45]I won't give up if you don't give up
[01:19.09]I won't give up if you don't give up
[01:25.22]I won't give up if you don't give up
[01:29.78]I need a sign to let me know you're here
[01:35.17]Cause my tv set just keeps it all from being clear
[01:40.88]I want a reason for the way things have to be
[01:46.82]I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me
[01:52.83]And I'm calling all angels
[02:04.18]And I'm calling all you angels
[02:16.43]When children have to play inside so they don't disappear
[02:21.53]While private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years
[02:27.68]And football teams are kissing queens and losing sight of having dreams
[02:33.26]In a world where all we want is only what we want until it's ours
[02:50.45]And I'm calling all angels
[03:01.68]And I'm calling all you angels
[03:12.88]And I'm calling all angels
[03:15.10](I won't give up if you don't give up)
[03:24.83]And I'm calling all you angels
[03:26.43](I won't give up if you don't give up)
[03:37.34]Calling all you angels
[03:38.77](I won't give up if you don't give up)
[03:41.79]Calling all you angels
[03:43.34](I won't give up if you don't give up)
[03:47.23]Calling all you angels
