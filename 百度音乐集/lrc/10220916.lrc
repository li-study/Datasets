[00:02.56]Lately
[00:06.44]By Stevie Wonder
[00:08.06]
[00:15.89]Lately I have had this strangest feeling,
[00:22.67]with no vivid reasons here to find.
[00:29.06]Yet the thought of losing you's been ringing
[00:34.88]round my mind...
[00:42.54]Far more frequently you're wearing perfume,
[00:49.42]with you say, "No special place to go"
[00:55.64]But when I ask will you be coming back soon,
[01:01.73]you don't know, never know.
[01:09.43]Well, I'm a man of many wishes,
[01:13.39]I hope my premonition misses,
[01:16.69]but what I really feel
[01:19.23]my eyes won't let me hide,
[01:22.40]cause they always start to cry.
[01:36.22]cause this time could mean goodbye.
[01:57.05]Lately I've been staring in the mirror,
[02:03.79]very slowly picking me apart.
[02:10.55]Tryin' to tell myself I have no reason
[02:16.09]with your heart.
[02:23.79]Just the other night while you were sleeping,
[02:30.30]I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name.
[02:37.13]But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping,
[02:43.21]you just say, nothing's changed.
[02:51.16]Well, I'm a man of many wishes,
[02:54.70]I hope my premonition misses,
[02:58.13]but what I really feel
[03:00.45]my eyes won't let me hide,
[03:03.67]cause they always start to cry.
[03:17.48]cause this time could mean goodbye.
[03:30.73]Well, I'm a man of many wishes,
[03:35.36]I hope my premonition misses,
[03:38.89]but what I really feel
[03:41.06]my eyes won't let me hide,
[03:44.26]cause they always start to cry.
[03:57.83]cause this time could mean good, goodbye.
