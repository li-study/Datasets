[00:02.94]If I Should Fall Behind
[00:05.67]Faith Hill
[00:08.04]
[00:18.86]We said we'd walk together baby come what may
[00:30.09]That come the twilight should we lose our way
[00:39.20]If as we're walking a hand should slip free
[00:49.04]I'll wait for you
[00:52.26]And should I fall behind
[00:55.83]Wait for me
[01:00.43]We swore we'd travel darlin side by side
[01:08.93]We'd help each other stay in stride
[01:19.30]But each lover's steps fall so differently
[01:27.67]So I'll wait for you
[01:31.57]And should I fall behind
[01:34.74]Wait for me
[01:39.44]Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true
[01:48.14]But you and I know what this world can do
[01:55.51]So lets make our steps clear that the other may see
[02:05.49]And I'll wait for you
[02:08.74]Should I fall behind
[02:11.53]Wait for me
[02:54.82]Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
[03:05.28]And there neath the oak's bough, soon we will be wed
[03:14.44]Should we lose each other
[03:18.57]In the shadow of the evening trees
[03:24.30]I will wait for you
[03:27.94]And should I fall behind wait for me
[03:34.10]Darlin I will wait for you
[03:37.94]Should I fall behind
[03:40.74]Wait for me
[03:52.91]Oh, wait for me
