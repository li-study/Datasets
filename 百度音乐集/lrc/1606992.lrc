[00:14.83]Sometimes it′s wrong to walk away
[00:19.86]Though you think it′s over
[00:21.78]Knowing there′s so much more to say
[00:26.57]Suddenly the moment′s gone
[00:31.12]And all your dreams are upside down
[00:34.59]And you just want to change the way the world goes round
[00:39.83]
[00:40.24]Tell me
[00:42.06]Have you ever loved and lost somebody
[00:45.54]Wished there was a chance to say I′m sorry
[00:48.87]Can′t you see
[00:51.84]That′s the way I feel about you and me
[00:54.88]Baby have you ever felt your heart was breaking
[00:59.03]Looking down the road you should be taking
[01:02.40]I should know
[01:05.48]′Cos I loved and lost the day I let (you go)
[01:11.42]
[01:12.85]Can′t help but think that this is wrong
[01:17.67]We should be together
[01:19.63]Back in your arms where I belong
[01:24.62]Now I finally realise
[01:29.26]It was forever that I found
[01:32.74]I′d give it all to change the way the world goes round
[01:37.80]
[01:38.29]Tell me
[01:40.03]Have you ever loved and lost somebody
[01:43.43]Wished there was a chance to say I′m sorry
[01:46.77]Can′t you see
[01:49.78]That′s the way I feel about you and me
[01:52.85]Baby have you ever felt your heart was breaking
[01:57.08]Looking down the road you should be taking
[02:00.50]I should know ( I should know)
[02:03.56]′Cos I loved and lost the day I let (you go)
[02:08.42]
[02:08.66]I really want to hear you say
[02:10.48]That you know just how it feels
[02:14.08]To have it all and let it slip away
[02:17.19]Can′t you see
[02:20.28]I know the moment′s gone
[02:23.86]I′m still holding on somehow
[02:27.60]Wishing I could change the way the world goes round
[02:33.04]
[02:34.76]Tell me
[02:36.34]Have you ever loved and lost somebody
[02:39.69]Wished there was a chance to say I′m sorry
[02:43.03]Can′t you see
[02:46.12]That′s the way I feel about you and me
[02:49.10]baby have you ever felt your heart was breaking
[02:53.37]Looking down the road you should be taking
[02:56.76]I should know (I should know)
[03:00.18]′Cos I loved and lost the day I let (you go)
[03:03.78]Yes I loved and lost the day I let
[03:06.77]Yes I loved and lost the day I let you go
