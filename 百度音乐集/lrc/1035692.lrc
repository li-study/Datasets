[00:04.15]
[00:04.89]The precious moment goes by
[00:09.19]I didn't want you to say,"Don't go"
[00:12.98]Cuz I didn't wanna
[00:13.83]Put a hold on your life
[00:16.47]I hope you understand
[00:18.43]
[00:19.63]The last movie we watched
[00:23.66]隣にいたね
[00:26.17]Like nothing special 僕は
[00:29.90]居眠りしてた
[00:34.66]The last morning I saw
[00:38.31]微笑む君
[00:41.05]Couldn't take my eyes off 僕は
[00:44.68]わかったよ You are the one
[00:48.56]
[00:49.00](Stop the time, and bring it back
[00:52.62]Is it too late, wonder if you still care?)
[00:56.57]Out on a street, actin'like tough, pretendin' that I'm free
[01:03.15]
[01:03.31]Just a little bit,
[01:04.62]少しくらい
[01:06.63]I'm a little sad,
[01:08.59]you're not in my life
[01:11.57]音もない部屋で
[01:15.04]僕はただひとり
[01:18.04]Just a little bit,
[01:19.74]痛いくらい
[01:21.75]I'm a little sad,
[01:23.50]you're not in my life
[01:26.15]振り返るだけで
[01:29.94]I don't know.
[01:31.13]I'm missing you
[01:34.29]
[01:34.92]The last word you said
[01:38.40]元気でいてね
[01:41.44]Like you'll never see me 僕は
[01:44.99]苦笑いした
[01:49.70]The last dream I had
[01:53.27]君はそこにいて
[01:56.35]So warm and gentle 僕は
[02:00.07]気付いたよ You are the one
[02:03.78]
[02:04.11](Stop the time, and bring it back
[02:07.73]Is it too late, wonder if you still care?)
[02:11.74]Out on a street, lookin' around, pretendin' that I'm fine
[02:18.16]
[02:18.54]Just a little bit,
[02:19.71]終わりくらい
[02:21.81]I'm a little glad,
[02:23.52]you were in my life
[02:26.39]あれほどの恋は
[02:29.94]僕にただひとり
[02:33.15]Just a little bit,
[02:35.04] 痛いくらい
[02:36.84]I'm a little glad,
[02:38.51] that you were in my life
[02:41.38]失くした今では
[02:44.90] I don't know,
[02:46.16]I'm missing you
[02:48.18]
[02:50.11]見送った
[02:52.73]華奢な肩を
[02:55.70]今でも
[02:57.72]叶うなら抱きしめたいのに
[03:02.59]抜け殻の体で
[03:06.87]何を伝えられる?
[03:10.69]You had to go, I know
[03:13.07]愛してたよ
[03:15.03] more than you'll ever know
[03:18.36]
[03:18.56]Just a little bit, 少しくらい
[03:21.72]I'm a little sad, you're not in my life
[03:26.37]音もない部屋で 僕はただひとり
[03:33.00]Just a little bit, 痛いくらい
[03:36.84]I'm a little sad, you're not in my life
[03:41.44]振り返るだけで I don't know, I'm missing you
[03:48.29]
[03:48.58]Just a little bit, 終わりくらい
[03:51.86]I'm a little glad, you were in my life
[03:56.25]あれほどの恋は 僕にただひとり
[04:03.11]Just a little bit, 痛いくらい
[04:06.75]I'm a little glad, that you were in my life
[04:10.93]失くした今では I don't know, I'm missing you
[04:19.09]
[04:25.68]おわり
[04:26.60]
