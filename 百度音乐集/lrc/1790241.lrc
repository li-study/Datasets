[00:20.24]Lost in a dream
[00:24.73]Don′t know which way to go
[00:30.29]If you are all that you seem
[00:34.77]Then baby I′m movin′ way too slow
[02:41.21][01:31.09][00:40.76]I′ve been a fool before
[02:42.67][01:32.53][00:42.39]Wouldn′t like to get my love caught
[02:44.22][01:34.06][00:44.08]In the slammin′ door
[02:55.78][01:35.72][00:45.64]How about some information--please
[03:53.35][03:43.32][03:33.36][03:23.33][03:20.81][03:18.27][03:13.31][03:08.30][03:03.30][01:50.64][01:40.72][01:00.52][00:50.66]Straight up now tell me

[03:58.66][03:38.49][01:55.85][01:05.77]Are you just having fun
[01:10.28]Time′s standing still
[01:14.64]Waiting for some small clue
[01:20.29]I keep getting chills
[01:24.36]When I think your love is true
[02:00.97]You are so hard to read
[02:03.80]You play hide and seek
[02:06.07]With your true intentions
[02:10.94]If you′re only playing games
[02:13.68]I′ll just have to say--bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
[02:20.90]Do do you love me..........
[02:45.84]Are you more than hot for me
[02:47.52]Or am I a page in your history-book
[02:51.13]I don′t mean to make demands
[02:53.43]But the word and the deed go hand in hand
