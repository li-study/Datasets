[00:05.00]
[00:13.57]What if I said yes
[00:18.30]What if I'd gone out that night
[00:22.35]What if you'd turned left
[00:25.76]Everything would've turned out alright
[00:30.00]What if I'd spoke up
[00:33.18]What'd if I'd took the keys
[00:37.68]What if I had tried a little harder
[00:41.44]instead of always trying to please
[02:52.53][02:37.50][02:03.52][01:48.12][01:02.62][00:47.27]Joey I'm so sorry
[00:54.81]Ohh can you hear me
[01:14.56]What if I'd said no
[01:19.00]What if we'd never fell in love
[01:23.21]What if we'd gone slow
[01:26.00]Or a little be faster and broken up
[01:30.83]Would I know this hurt
[01:34.53]Would I feel this pain
[01:38.80]Do you know that with all I have left
[01:41.91]in my very last breath I will call your name
[01:55.67]Ohoohoh can you hear me?
[02:16.91]Were you sad
[02:18.35]Were you scared
[02:19.40]Did you wish for a prayer to be free
[02:24.96]Was it quiet and cold
[02:27.13]Was it light or too dark to see
[02:31.69]And did you reach for me
[02:44.82]Ohh can you hear me?
[03:00.53]Oohhhohh can you hear me
