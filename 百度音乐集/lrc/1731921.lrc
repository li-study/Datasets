[ti:All I Wanna Do]

[00:13.38]All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
[00:16.92]Says the man next to me out of nowhere
[00:21.55]apropos Of nothing
[00:23.30]He says his name's William
[00:25.29]but I'm sure He's Bill or Billy Mac or Buddy
[00:29.42]he's plain ugly to me
[00:31.88]And I wonder if he`s ever had fun in his life.
[00:37.86]We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
[00:41.03]In a bar that faces a giant car wash
[00:45.21]The good people of the world are washing their cars
[00:48.71]On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
[00:51.08]As best they can in skirts and suits
[00:54.08]They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
[00:57.99]Back to the phone company the record store
[01:01.69]Well they're nothing like Billy and me
[03:23.29][03:15.52][03:07.97][02:27.79][02:20.12][02:12.41][01:20.47][01:12.46][01:03.80]All I wanna do is have some fun
[03:28.45][03:19.43][03:11.67][02:24.09][02:16.11][01:16.12][01:07.66]I got a feeling I'm not the only one
[02:32.43][01:24.59]Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
[01:37.69]I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
[01:41.09]And Billy likes to peel the labels
[01:42.98]From his bottles of Bud
[01:45.59]and shred them on the bar
[01:47.10]Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
[01:50.22]Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
[01:55.88]Before blowing and cursing them out - and he's watching
[01:58.79]The Buds as they spin on the floor
[02:02.12]A happy couple enters the bar
[02:06.14]dangerously close to one another
[02:09.68]The bartender looks up from his want ads.
[02:54.33]Otherwise the bar is ours, and the day and the night
[02:59.62]And the car wash too, the matches and the Buds
[03:03.37]And the clean and dirty cars, the sun and the moon
