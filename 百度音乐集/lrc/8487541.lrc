[00:00.71]it's five o'clock this morning, and the sun is on the rise
[00:08.52]There's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes
[00:16.55]The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone
[00:24.01]And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come
[00:30.84]And it's goodbye again, i'm sorry to be leavin' you
[00:38.86]Goodbye again, as if you didn't know
[00:46.07]It's goodbye again, and i wish you could tell me
[00:50.78]Why do we always fight when i have to go
[01:02.46]It seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and warm
[01:09.27]I long to lay me down again, to hold you in my arms
[01:17.12]I long to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile
[01:24.69]Other voices beckon me, to go a little while
[01:31.58]And it's goodbye again, i'm sorry to be leavin' you
[01:39.23]Goodbye again, as if you didn't know
[01:46.46]It's goodbye again, and i wish you could tell me
[01:54.19]Why do we always fight when i have to go
[02:01.25]Have to go and see some friends of mine, some that i don't know
[02:09.64]Some who aren't familiar with my name,
[02:16.87]It's something that's inside of me not hard to understand
[02:24.57]It's anyone who listens to me sing
[02:33.03]And if your hours are empty now, who am i to blame
[02:39.89]You think if i were always here, our love would be the same
[02:48.11]As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone
[02:55.13]And lying by your side, the greatest peace i've ever known
[03:02.18]But it's goodbye again, i'm sorry to be leavin' you
[03:09.71]Goodbye again, as if you didn't know
[03:16.86]It's goodbye again, and i wish you could tell me
[03:24.73]Why do we always fight when i have to go
