[01:05.61]On a morning from a Bogart movie
[01:10.64]in a country where they turn back time
[01:15.35]you go strolling through the crowd
[01:17.47]like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime
[01:22.70]She comes out of the sun in a silk dress
[01:26.43]running like a watercolour in the rain
[01:32.02]Don't bother asking for explanations
[01:34.22]She'll just tell you that she came
[01:38.35]in the year of the cat
[01:40.01]
[01:55.83]She doesn't give you time for questions
[02:00.11]as she locks up your arm in hers
[02:04.67]and you follow till your sense
[02:06.92]of which direction completely disappears
[02:12.83]By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
[02:17.14]there's a hidden door she leads you to
[02:21.72]these days, she says, I feel my life
[02:24.90]just like a river running through
[02:28.03]the year of the cat
[02:32.95]
[02:45.23]Well, she looks at you so cooly
[02:49.55]And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
[02:52.55]She comes in incense and patchouli
[02:54.93]So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
[03:04.52]The year of the cat
[03:12.10]
[04:29.14]Well, morning comes and you're still with her
[04:32.69]and the bus and the tourists are gone
[04:35.45]and you've thrown away the choice
[04:38.45]and lost your ticket
[04:39.84]so you have to stay on
[04:44.93]But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
[04:47.30]in the rhythm of the new-born day
[04:53.01]You know sometime you're bound to leave her
[04:56.26]But for now you're going to stay
[04:58.62]in the year of the cat
[05:16.30]en~in the year of the cat
