[00:13.99]Someday he'll come along
[00:17.63]The man I love
[00:20.74]And he'll be big and strong
[00:24.14]The man I love
[00:26.58]And when he comes my way
[00:30.70]I'll do my best to make him stay
[00:40.37]He'll look at me and smile
[00:43.91]I'll understand
[00:47.21]And in a little while
[00:50.15]He'll take my hand
[00:52.89]And though it seems absurd
[00:56.57]I know we both won't say a word
[01:05.33]Maybe I shall meet him
[01:07.74]Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not
[01:17.58]Still I'm sure to meet him one day
[01:23.50]Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
[01:31.77]He'll build a little home
[01:34.67]Just meant for two
[01:37.67]From which I'd never roam
[01:41.06]Who would, would you?
[01:44.26]And so all else above
[01:47.34]I'm waiting for the man I love
[02:22.20]Maybe I shall meet him
[02:24.26]Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not
[02:31.65]Still I'm sure to meet him one day
[02:35.81]Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
[02:45.31]He'll build a little home
[02:48.29]Just meant for two
[02:51.38]From which I'd never roam
[02:54.40]Who would, would you?
[02:57.67]And so all else above
[03:00.80]I'm waiting for the man I love
