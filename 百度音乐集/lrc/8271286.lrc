[00:04.18]\"These Streets\"
[00:06.03]
[00:13.61]Cross the border,
[00:20.22]Into the big bad world
[00:23.62]Where it takes you \'bout an hour
[00:25.99]Just to cross the road
[00:27.76]Just to stumble across another poor old soul from
[00:32.17]The dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
[00:35.94]Eye fight with my brain to believe my eyes
[00:39.62]And it\'s harder than you think
[00:41.94]To believe this sadness
[00:44.10]That creeps up my spine
[00:46.45]And haunts me through the night
[00:48.41]And life is good and the girls are gorgeous
[00:52.38]Suddenly the air smells much greener now
[00:55.79]And I\'m wondering \'round
[00:57.94]With a half pack of cigarettes
[01:00.19]Searching for the change that I\'ve lost somehow
[01:03.86]
[01:04.09]These streets have too many names for me
[01:07.87]I\'m used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Arkie
[01:12.83]I\'ll get used to this eventually
[01:15.87]I know, I know
[01:18.61]
[01:19.43]Where\'d the days go? When all we did was play
[01:28.21]And the stress that we were under wasn\'t stress at all
[01:31.99]Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
[01:35.43]Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
[01:40.28]You see millions of people with millions of cares
[01:43.99]And I struggle to the train to make my way home
[01:47.98]I look at the people as they sit there alone
[01:51.41]
[01:51.67]Life is good, and the sun is shining
[01:56.58]Everybody flirts to their ideal place
[02:00.25]And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them
[02:04.30]Trying to pretend that they\'ve got some space
[02:08.03]
[02:08.39]These streets have too many names for me
[02:11.84]I\'m used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Arkie
[02:17.11]I\'ll get used to this eventually
[02:20.05]I know, I know
[02:23.47]
[02:23.71]These streets have too many names for me
[02:28.06]I\'m used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Arkie
[02:33.06]I\'ll get used to this eventually
[02:36.16]I know, I know
[02:40.25]
[02:40.44]Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous
[02:44.66]Suddenly the air smells much greener now
[02:48.69]And I\'m wondering \'round
[02:50.20]With a half pack of cigarettes
[02:52.56]Searching for the change that I\'ve lost somehow
[02:55.97]
[02:56.17]These streets have too many names for me
[02:59.96]I\'m used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Arkie
[03:05.79]I\'ll get used to this eventually
[03:08.28]I know, I know
[03:10.32]
[03:10.55]These streets have too many names for me
[03:17.03]I\'m used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in our Arkie
[03:22.15]I\'ll get used to this eventually
[03:25.46]I know, I know
[03:30.06]I know, I know
[03:35.87]I know```````````
