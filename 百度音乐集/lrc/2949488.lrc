[00:03.22]Gaelic Storm
[00:04.53]
[00:24.76]As I came down through Dublin City
[00:26.54]At the hour of twelve at night
[00:28.54]Who should I see but the Spanish Lady
[00:30.57]Washing her feet by candlelight
[00:32.49]First she washed them, then she dried them
[00:34.66]Over a fire of amber coal
[00:36.83]
[00:38.73]In all my life I ne’er did see
[00:41.59]A maid so sweet about the soul
[00:43.56]Whack for the toora loora laddy
[00:45.83]Whack for the toora loora lay
[00:47.66]Whack for the toora loora laddy
[00:49.73]Whack for the toora loora lay
[00:52.03]
[00:59.06]As I came back through Dublin City,
[01:01.67]At the hour of half past eight
[01:03.86]Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
[01:05.80]Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
[01:07.72]First she tossed it, then she brushed it
[01:09.86]On her lap was a silver comb
[01:11.56]
[01:14.52]In all my life I ne’er did see
[01:16.62]A maid so fair since I did roam
[01:18.59]Whack for the toora loora laddy

[01:27.13]
[01:33.60]As I went back through Dublin City
[01:36.58]As the sun began to set
[01:38.81]Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
[01:40.67]Catching a moth in a golden net
[01:42.40]When she saw me, then she fled me
[01:44.82]Lifting her petticoat over her knee
[01:46.72]
[01:49.25]In all my life I ne’er did see
[01:51.51]A maid so shy as the Spanish Lady
[01:53.49]Whack for the toora loora laddy
[01:55.73]Whack for the toora loora lay
[01:57.74]Whack for the toora loora laddy
