[00:09.54]Oh Mr. Pit, oh Mr. Pit, Mr. Pitiful
[00:13.75]Who let you down?
[00:17.30]Who let you down?
[00:18.81]Who let you down?
[00:20.99]
[00:23.39]You still don't believe, you don't believe
[00:26.54]You don't believe, and your grievances show
[00:32.29]When your soapbox unfolds
[00:35.14]
[00:35.60]But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
[00:41.00]I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
[00:46.50]
[00:46.99]I just want to know how you've been
[00:50.49]It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
[00:54.41]Mulling it all over in my head
[00:57.37]I hope that you see through your picket
[01:01.59]I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
[01:10.00]To make amends
[01:14.27]And still be friends, still be my friend
[01:21.23]
[01:23.23]So where did you go? Where did you go?
[01:26.30]Where did you go while I was out?
[01:31.22]While I was out? While I was out?
[01:37.68]Well I don't believe, I don't believe
[01:40.28]I don't believe everything I see
[01:45.00]And if you don't like the movie then quit acting
[01:49.00]
[01:49.60]But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
[01:54.86]I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
[01:59.91]
[02:01.66]I just want to know how you've been
[02:05.97]It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
[02:09.32]Mulling it all over in my head
[02:12.52]I hope that you see through your picket
[02:16.68]I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
[02:24.88]To make amends
[02:29.24]And still be friends, still be friends
[02:36.30]
[02:38.18]Still be my friend
[02:42.59]Still be my friend
