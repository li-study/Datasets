[00:22.97]Hey Nikita is it cold
[00:28.03]In your little corner of the world
[00:34.20]You could roll around the globe
[00:39.54]And never find a warmer soul to know
[00:43.71]
[00:45.55]Oh I saw you by the wall
[00:50.59]Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
[00:55.81]With eyes that looked like ice on fire
[01:01.44]The human heart a captive in the snow
[01:05.65]
[01:07.53]Oh Nikita You will never know
[01:13.54]anything about my home
[01:17.31]I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
[01:24.42]Nikita I need you so
[01:29.79]Oh Nikita is the other side
[01:35.55]of any given line in time
[01:40.03]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
[01:44.75]Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
[01:49.98]
[02:00.01]Do you ever dream of me
[02:05.00]Do you ever see the letters that I write
[02:11.11]When you look up through the wire
[02:16.13]Nikita do you count the stars at night
[02:20.50]
[02:22.64]And if there comes a time
[02:27.80]Guns and gates no longer hold you in
[02:33.31]And if you're free to make a choice
[02:38.62]Just look towards the west and find a friend
[02:43.49]
[02:44.44]Oh Nikita You will never know
[02:50.62]anything about my home
[02:54.24]I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
[03:01.22]Nikita I need you so
[03:06.57]Oh Nikita is the other side
[03:12.51]of any given line in time
[03:17.05]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
[03:21.78]Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
[03:31.25]
[04:18.42]Oh Nikita You will never know
[04:23.54]Never know anything about my home
[04:28.64]I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
[04:35.66]Nikita I need you so
[04:40.89]Oh Nikita is the other side
[04:46.96]of any given line in time
[04:51.42]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
[04:56.04]Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
[05:08.00]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
[05:18.94]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
[05:30.24]Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
