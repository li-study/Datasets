[00:16.43]Word came through in a letter,
[00:22.15]One of us changing our minds.
[00:29.88]You won't need to guess who, since I usually do,
[00:36.98]Not send letters to me that are mine.
[00:43.13]
[00:45.60]Told you I saw this coming,
[00:52.45]That I'd practically packed up my things.
[01:00.35]Was glad at the time that I'd said I was fine but,
[01:08.64]All honesty knows, I wasn't ready, no.
[01:14.56]
[01:16.41]And so here we go bluebird,
[01:23.26]Back to the sky on your own.
[01:31.01]Oh let him go bluebird,
[01:38.55]Ready to fly,
[01:43.68]You and I,
[01:45.67]Here we go.
[01:54.07]Here we go.
[01:57.34]
[02:01.68]This pair of wings worn and rusted,
[02:09.71]Too many years by my side
[02:17.60]They can carry me swear to be,
[02:21.71]Sturdy and strong but see,
[02:25.71]Turning them on still means goodbye.
[02:33.50]
[02:33.89]And so here we go bluebird,
[02:40.90]Gather your strength and rise up.
[02:48.33]Oh let him go bluebird.
[02:55.92]Oh let him go bluebird.
[03:04.03]Oh let him go bluebird.
[03:11.31]Ready to fly,
[03:15.68]You and I,
[03:18.06]Here we go.
[03:25.97]Here we go...
