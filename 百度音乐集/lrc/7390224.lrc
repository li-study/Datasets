[00:17]They made up their minds
[00:20]And they started packing
[00:25]They left before the sun came up that day
[00:33]An exit to eternal summer slacking
[00:41]But where were they going Without ever knowing the way?
[00:49]They drank up the wine
[00:51]And they got to talking
[00:56]They now had more important things to say
[01:04]And when the car broke down They started walking
[01:12]Where were they going without ever knowing the way?
[01:19]Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold
[01:24]And It's always summer, they'll never get cold
[01:28]They'll Never get hungry
[01:30]They'll never get old and gray
[01:36]You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere
[01:40]They won't make it home
[01:42]But they really don't care
[01:44]They wanted the highway
[01:46]They're happy there today , today
[01:54]The children woke up
[01:57]And they couldn't find 'em
[02:02]They Left before the sun came up that day
[02:10]They just drove off
[02:13]And left it all behind 'em
[02:18]But Where were they going Without ever knowing the way?
[03:17][02:25]Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold
[03:19][02:30]And It's always summer, they'll never get cold
[03:23][02:34]They'll Never get hungry
[03:25][02:36]They'll never get old and gray
[03:31][02:41]You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere
[03:35][02:46]They Won't make it home
[03:39][02:47]But they really don't care
[03:41][02:50]They wanted the highway
[03:42][02:55][02:52]They're happy there today , today (repeat)
