[00:11.62]You lift me up, then knock me down
[00:17.66]I’m never sure just what to feel when you’re around
[00:23.71]I speak my heart, but don’t know why
[00:29.93]Coz you don’t ever really say what’s on your mind
[00:35.53]
[00:35.94]It’s like I’m walking on broken glass
[00:42.40]I wanna know but I don’t wanna ask

[00:57.48]Do the talking
[01:00.36]Just say you want me
[01:03.45]Oh you don’t need me

[01:21.41]
[01:24.73]You let me in, but then sometimes
[01:30.69]Your empty eyes just make me feel so cold inside
[01:36.68]When I’m with you, it’s like rolling dice
