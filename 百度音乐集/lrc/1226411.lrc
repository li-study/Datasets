[ti:Tell Her About It]
[ar:Billy Joel]
[al:]

[00:11.99]Listen boy
[00:13.20]Don't want to see you let a good thing
[00:15.51]Slip away
[00:16.70]
[00:17.07]You know I don't like watching
[00:18.23]Anybody make the same mistakes
[00:20.55]I made
[00:21.84]
[00:22.27]She's a real nice girl
[00:23.29]And she's always there for you
[00:27.27]But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
[00:31.82]
[00:32.88]Listen boy
[00:34.03]I'm sure that you think you got it all
[00:36.20]Under control
[00:37.55]
[00:38.05]You don't want somebody telling you
[00:40.00]The way to stay in someone's soul
[00:42.35]
[00:43.13]You're a big boy now
[00:44.31]You'll never let her go
[00:48.20]But that's just the kind of thing
[00:50.38]She ought to know
[00:52.35]
[00:53.93]Tell her about it
[00:56.10]Tell her everything you feel
[00:59.18]Give her every reason to accept
[01:02.31]That you're for real
[01:03.50]
[01:04.49]Tell her about it
[01:06.62]Tell her all your crazy dreams
[01:09.70]Let her know you need her
[01:11.69]Let her know how much she means
[01:14.70]
[01:25.55]Listen boy
[01:26.92]It's not automatically a certain guarantee
[01:30.60]To insure yourself
[01:31.71]You've got to provide communication constantly
[01:35.21]
[01:35.91]When you love someone
[01:36.99]You're always insecure
[01:40.92]And there's only one good way
[01:42.59]To reassure
[01:45.19]
[01:46.59]Tell her about it
[01:48.61]Let her know how much you care
[01:51.59]When she can't be with you
[01:53.53]Tell her you wish you were there
[01:56.59]
[01:57.19]Tell her about it
[01:58.92]Every day before you leave
[02:01.84]Pay her some attention
[02:03.92]Give her something to believe
[02:06.93]
[02:08.29]'Cause now and then
[02:09.42]She'll get to worrying
[02:12.34]Just because you haven't spoken
[02:14.58]For so long
[02:18.10]Though you may not have done anything
[02:23.14]Will that be a consolation when she's gone
[02:27.76]
[02:28.89]Listen boy
[02:29.98]It's good information from a man
[02:31.88]Who's made mistakes
[02:32.69]
[02:33.79]Just a word or two that she gets from you
[02:36.16]Could be the difference that it makes
[02:38.20]
[02:38.90]She's a trusting soul
[02:40.07]She's put her trust in you
[02:43.71]But a girl like that won't tell you
[02:46.05]What you should do
[02:47.86]
[02:49.40]Tell her about it
[02:51.42]Tell her everything you feel
[02:54.52]Give her every reason
[02:56.49]To accept that you're for real
[02:59.78]
[03:00.40]Tell her about it
[03:01.92]Tell her all your crazy dreams
[03:04.98]Let her know you need her
[03:06.96]Let her know how much she means
[03:10.00]
[03:10.69]Tell her about it
[03:13.25]Tell her how you feel right now
[03:15.53]Tell her about it
[03:18.19]The girl don't want to wait too long
[03:20.78]You got to tell her about it
[03:23.49]Tell her now and you won't go wrong
[03:26.03]You got to tell her about it
[03:28.86]Before it gets too late
[03:30.69]You got to tell her about it
[03:33.81]You know the girl don't want
[03:36.20]To wait--you got to
[03:37.09]Tell her about it
[03:38.52]
