[00:00.00]
[00:05.13]You're an angel, I'm a devil
[00:09.23]But we'll meet somewhere in between.
[00:13.09]Heaven, Hell, or the bedroom,
[00:16.36]I'll take you away from everything.
[00:20.99]You're a dream and I'm a nightmare
[00:24.80]But we'll meet somewhere in between.
[00:28.87]Your sheets, your covers, and the headboard.
[00:32.78]I'll be a king if you are a queen.
[00:36.27]
[00:36.89]I just fell in love for the first time,
[00:40.91]Watch as I move myself up off the ground.
[00:45.57]In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight,
[00:48.85]Can You see me now?
[00:51.89]
[00:52.87]I turn my back
[00:53.93]And walk away, away from the pain.
[00:57.01]Screaming loud,
[00:57.89]Drowning out from the sound of the rain
[01:01.10]Listen up,
[01:01.81]I've had enough of all this waiting.
[01:04.50]I need you more right now than I ever did.
[01:08.60]
[01:09.13]You're the minutes, I'm the hours.
[01:12.37]But we'll meet somewhere in between.
[01:16.85]Never, now, or too soon,
[01:20.82]I say we meet at a quarter till three.
[01:24.18]
[01:24.89]I just fell in love for the first time,
[01:28.91]Watch as I move myself up off the ground.
[01:33.33]In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight,
[01:36.80]Can You see me now?
[01:39.99]
[01:40.64]I turn my back
[01:42.01]And walk away, away from the pain.
[01:44.97]Screaming loud,
[01:45.92]Drowning out from the sound of the rain
[01:49.11]Listen up,
[01:49.82]I've had enough of all this waiting.
[01:52.83]I need you more right now than I ever did.
[01:56.72]
[02:29.09]I turn my back
[02:30.06]And walk away, away from the pain.
[02:33.31]Screaming loud,
[02:34.18]Drowning out from the sound of the rain
[02:37.32]Listen up,
[02:38.07]I've had enough of all this waiting.
[02:41.06]I need you more right now than I ever did.
[02:44.84]
[02:45.46]I turn my back
[02:46.46]And walk away, away from the pain.
[02:49.73]Screaming loud,
[02:50.86]Drowning out from the sound of the rain
[02:53.71]Listen up,
[02:54.45]I've had enough of all this waiting.
[02:57.22]I need you more right now than I ever did.
[03:00.71]
[03:00.98]I turn my back
[03:01.90]And walk away, away from the pain.
[03:04.98]Screaming loud,
[03:05.96]Drowning out from the sound of the rain
[03:09.22]Listen up,
[03:10.01]I've had enough of all this waiting.
[03:13.00]I need you more right now than I ever did.
