[00:09.50]- Neil Diamond
[00:17.50]
[00:19.90]Tonight you're mine completely
[00:29.84]You give your love so sweetly
[00:38.68]Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
[00:49.73]But will you love me tomorrow
[00:58.79]Tomorrow
[01:01.93]
[01:04.47]Is this a lasting treasure
[01:14.40]Or just a moment's pleasure
[01:23.55]Can I believe the magic of your sighs
[01:34.19]Will you still love me tomorrow
[01:41.87]
[01:44.03]Tonight with words unspoken
[01:54.06]You say that I'm the only one
[02:03.89]But will my heart be broken
[02:12.63]When the night meets the morning sun
[02:20.86]
[02:24.04]I'd like to know that your love
[02:33.82]Is love I can be sure of
[02:42.09]So tell me now, and I won't ask again
[02:53.30]Will you still love me tomorrow
[03:08.21]Will you still love me tomorrow
