[00:00.00]Lene Marlin - Story
[00:18.47]
[00:20.47]I heard about your story from a friend
[00:25.75]To let go and make an end, that's what you did
[00:32.85]You left some words saying now it would be good
[00:37.84]
[00:41.00]You knew they'd cry, but you hoped they understood
[00:49.34]Things you've had to face, what you have seen
[00:54.41]To make it through each day, you tried,
[00:58.50]Without the tears
[01:00.80]
[01:01.65]They tried to help, but they didn't see you crawl
[01:09.79]They knew you fought, but they never
[01:12.72]Thought you'd fall
[01:15.93]They never thought you'd fall.
[01:19.04]
[01:22.24]Tell them please, how could they know
[01:26.28]Hurts inside, no scars to show
[01:30.32]You played the lead, and never once you failed
[01:35.89]
[01:38.28]And the place from where you watch us now
[01:42.72]Hope you've found your peace somehow,
[01:49.04]Peace somehow
[01:51.95]
[01:55.05]I heard about your story through the years
[02:00.27]Know 'bout all your hurt and fears
[02:04.33]I won't forget
[02:07.45]I wrote a song that I wish for you to hear
[02:15.59]It's about yourself and the life you couldn't bear
[02:20.76]
[04:15.04][03:42.19][02:28.08]Tell them please, how could they know
[04:19.08][03:46.20][02:32.27]Hurts inside, no scars to show
[04:23.07][03:50.24][02:36.20]You played the lead, and never once you failed
[04:28.73][03:55.99][02:41.83]
[04:31.11][03:58.10][02:44.08]And the place from where you watch us now
[04:35.55][04:02.64][02:48.57]Hope you've found your peace somehow,
[04:50.15][04:42.25][04:08.94][02:55.03]Peace somehow
[04:53.66][04:46.10][04:12.25][02:58.10]
[03:01.99]I wanna remember all there's about you,
[03:06.72]And I know there's so much
[03:10.12]I see all the faces, the tears and embraces
[03:17.17]Wish you could be here to see it too
[03:26.61]
[03:31.47]Could be here to see it too
[03:34.91]
