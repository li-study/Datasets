[00:01.38]Look at me
[00:05.17]Look into my eyes
[00:07.77]Tell me, do you see that I am always by your side?
[00:15.41]Or has the world got you down on your knees?
[00:22.61]Come to me
[00:29.60]Look at you
[00:32.24]Look into your heart
[00:35.91]Tell me is there room for you to make a brand new start?
[00:43.44]Or has the world gotten to you and made you dark?

[00:56.17]
[00:56.94]’Cuz when you cry, all your tears I will wipe away
[01:04.01]And when you laugh, who you think got you that way?
[01:11.47]And when you dream,
[01:17.54]when you wake up, is it me you want to see?
[01:52.53]’Cuz when you cry, all your tears I will wipe away
[01:59.62]and when you laugh, who you think got you that way?
[02:06.31]And when you dream,
[02:13.26]when you wake up, is it me you want to see?
[02:20.37]Look at us
[02:23.12]Look around the world
[02:26.75]’Cuz all you seem to find are unhappy boys—unhappy girls
[02:33.91]and tell me … is that what you want for you and me?
[02:40.97]Don’t you want to be happy?
[02:47.42]’Cuz when you cry, all your tears I will wipe away
[02:54.53]and when you laugh, who you think got you that way?
[03:01.50]And when you dream,
[03:08.49]when you wake up, is it me you want to see?
[03:15.74]Baby
