[00:23.21]What can I compare you to,
[00:25.80]a favorite pair of shoes?
[00:28.38]Maybe my bright red boots
[00:31.13]if they had wings
[00:33.82]Funny how we animate
[00:36.77]colorful objects saved
[00:39.37]Funny how it's hard to take
[00:42.14]a love with no sting.
[00:44.18]But come on take it, come on take it,
[00:46.77]take it from me
[00:49.61]But come on take it, come on take it,
[00:52.37]take it from me
[00:55.10]But come on take it, come on take it,
[00:58.12]take it from me
[00:59.67](we've got a good life)
[01:07.04]What can I compare you to,
[01:09.73]a window the sun shines through?
[01:12.06]Maybe the silver moon
[01:15.00]a smile rising
[01:17.88]The magic of the fading day
[01:20.13]satellites on parade
[01:22.90]A toast to the plans we've made
[01:26.04]to live like kings.
[01:27.78]But come on take it, come on take it,
[01:30.35]take it from me
[01:33.17]But come on take it, come on take it,
[01:35.75]take it from me
[01:38.70]But come on take it, come on take it,
[01:41.41]take it from me
[01:43.02](we've got a good life)
[01:50.20]I lose my breath
[01:52.91]despite the air
[01:55.60]When the rain falls down
[01:57.85]I give in to despair
[02:01.04]Pink magnolia in winter
[02:04.13]she doesn’t care
[02:06.43]if you don’t show up
[02:08.62]to have another cup.
[02:34.00]What can I compare you to,
[02:36.68]when everything looks like you?
[02:39.51]I get a bit confused with every Spring
[02:44.96]Flowers that bloom your eyes
[02:47.88]hummingbirds side by side
[02:50.15]My heart won't stay entirely in this rib caging
[02:55.15]But come on take it, come on take it,
[02:57.59]take it from me
[03:00.59]But come on take it, come on take it,
[03:03.21]take it from me
[03:06.21]But come on take it, come on take it,
[03:08.75]take it from me
[03:10.19](we've got a good life)
[03:13.98]
