[00:00.00]Jennifer Lopez - Until It Beats No More
[00:00.50]
[00:05.07]I was down for the count
[00:08.66]Feeling like I've come to the end
[00:13.47]Nothing really mattered
[00:18.09]Nothing left for me to meant
[00:22.60]
[00:24.27]And then you came
[00:25.24]And I still couldn't see
[00:27.51]Til you tore down every wall in me
[00:32.41]How you healed me with your patience
[00:38.38]If it's all I ever do
[00:40.81]I never stop loving you
[00:43.13]
[00:43.44]Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
[00:48.06]And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
[00:52.88]I'm in love
[00:55.32]And it's all because of you
[00:57.67]I was fading but you pulled me through
[01:02.54]I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
[01:07.22]And there ain't no doubt about it
[01:09.88]It's love and I have found it
[01:12.01]Feel the beat again, stronger than before
[01:16.76]I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more
[01:25.58]
[01:26.48]I was in place full of pain
[01:29.91]With a broken down heart in despair
[01:34.87]He took away my feelings
[01:39.60]And made it hard for me to care
[01:44.18]But then you crashed through the door, to my soul
[01:49.45]Put back all the pieces and made me home
[01:54.25]I was living in the past
[01:57.03]Oh no
[02:00.03]Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back
[02:04.54]
[02:04.84]Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
[02:09.60]And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
[02:14.38]I'm in love
[02:16.88]And it's all because of you
[02:19.27]I was fading but you pulled me through
[02:24.14]Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
[02:28.81]And there ain't no doubt about it
[02:31.42]It's love and I have found it
[02:33.43]Feel the beat again, stronger than before
[02:38.48]I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more
[02:47.18]
[02:52.90]Whatever you want me to
[02:55.48]I'm gonna see you through
[02:57.90]All I ever do
[03:00.48]Never stop loving you
[03:04.64]
[03:04.92]Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
[03:09.26]And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
[03:14.29]I'm in love
[03:16.89]And it's all because of you
[03:19.30]I was fading but you pulled me through
[03:24.25]I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
[03:28.83]And there ain't no doubt about it
[03:31.27](There's just no doubt)
[03:33.69]I'm much stronger
[03:35.75]So much stronger than before
[03:38.39]I'm gonna give u my heart
[03:40.85]Until it beats no more
