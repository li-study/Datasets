[00:14.05]This is the greatest and best song in the world... Tribute.
[00:22.61]
[00:25.08]Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
[00:30.39]we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
[00:36.37]All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon... in the middle... of the road.
[00:45.88]And he said:
[00:47.71]
[00:48.64]"Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul)
[00:53.24]
[00:58.73]Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
[01:03.39]and we each said... "Okay."
[01:07.60]
[01:08.66]And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
[01:11.18]Just so happened to be,
[01:13.53]The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
[01:15.32]
[01:19.03]Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
[01:22.20]One and one make two, two and one make three,
[01:24.35]It was destiny.
[01:26.87]Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
[01:28.99]When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
[01:32.43]And the grass doth grow...
[01:34.14]
[01:37.63]Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
[01:40.49]Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
[01:45.01]And the beast was done.
[01:48.06]He asked us: "(snort) Be you angels?"
[01:53.41]And we said, "Nay. We are but men."
[01:56.68]Rock!
[01:57.73]Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
[02:02.19]Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
[02:06.74]
[02:08.51]This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.
[02:14.05]This is just a tribute.
[02:18.19]Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.
[02:23.38]This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,
[02:31.77]All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,
[02:36.34]All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.
[02:42.04]
[03:01.06]And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
[03:04.28]the song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound
[03:06.42]anything like this song.
[03:07.70]
[03:09.22]This is just a tribute! You gotta believe me!
[03:13.08]And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
[03:19.17]Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
[03:22.87]So surprised to find you can't stop it.
[03:24.13]
[03:33.60]All right! All right!
[03:44.15]
