[00:06.40]
[00:06.65]Time and again I’ve longed for adventure
[00:10.12]Something to make my heart beat the faster
[00:14.45]What did I long for?
[00:17.03]I never really knew
[00:19.19]
[00:23.72]Finding your love I’ve found my adventure
[00:27.87]Touching your hand
[00:29.61]My heart beats the faster
[00:32.61]All that I want in all of this world is you
[00:38.50]
[00:43.35]You are the promised kiss of springtime
[00:51.20]That makes the lonely winter seem long
[00:57.18]You are the breathless hush of evening
[01:08.37]That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
[01:13.28]
[01:16.28]You are the angel glow that lights a star
[01:24.70]The dearest things I know are what you are
[01:33.57]Some day my happy arms will hold you
[01:42.70]And some day I’ll know that moment divine
[01:51.27]When all the things you are
[01:56.13]Are mine
[01:58.25]
[02:34.33]You are the angel glow that lights a star
[02:42.60]The dearest things I know are what you are
[02:51.99]Some day my happy arms will hold you
[02:59.90]And some day I’ll know that moment divine
[03:09.03]When all the things you are
[03:14.91]Are mine
[03:30.08]Are mine
[03:31.64]
[03:35.75]All the things you are
[03:38.79]Are mine
[03:40.99]
