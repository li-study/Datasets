
[00:12.64]Words are falling form your lips like
[00:15.39]Christmas to my hips
[00:18.43]So dangerous the strangest feeling of being
[00:23.98]I want willow trees and melodies and flowers counting
[00:29.53]Hours till he\'s breathing leaving the rest behind
[00:36.21]Cause I’m full of love
[00:49.83]Like waves washes sands clean
[00:55.83]And the sun sparkles meadows green
[01:15.76]I want kisses and dresses
[01:19.07]A late night message that cradles, halos me to sleep
[01:28.60]Cause I’m full of love
[01:39.57]Yeah I’m full of the above
[01:52.85]Like a mother leaves her cubs astray
[01:59.25]And a teacher leaves at the end of each day
[02:05.03]I’ll stay
[02:41.82]So cover me but lover please be patient
[02:46.34]Loves ancient but not for me
[02:53.37]Cause I’m full of love
[03:05.43]Yeah I’m full of the above
[03:18.78]Like Christmas stays with you
[03:24.91]Walk through darkened streets as we lay true
[03:30.94]Lights from your heart lead me to you
