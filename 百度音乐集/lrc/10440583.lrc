[00:01.50]Uptown Girl
[00:03.05]Westlife
[00:05.41]
[00:08.39]Uptown girl
[00:10.72]She's been living in her uptown world
[00:14.46]I bet she never had a back street guy
[00:18.16]I bet her mama never told her why
[00:21.85]I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
[00:25.52]She's been living in her white bread world
[00:29.41]As long as anyone with hot blood can
[00:33.07]And now she's looking for a downtown man
[00:36.75]That's what I am
[00:38.60]And when she knows what
[00:41.73]She wants from her time
[00:46.99]And when she wakes up
[00:49.17]And makes up her mind
[00:53.35]She'll see I'm not so tough
[00:56.96]Just because
[00:58.91]I'm in love with an uptown girl
[01:02.85]You know I've seen her in her uptown world
[01:06.58]She's getting tired of her high class toys
[01:10.42]And all her presents from her uptown boys
[01:13.98]She's got a choice
[01:15.99]
[01:29.66]Uptown girl
[01:32.55]You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
[01:36.34]But maybe someday when my ship comes in
[01:40.12]She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
[01:43.66]And then I'll win
[01:45.39]And when she's walking
[01:48.69]She's looking so fine
[01:53.12]And when she's talking
[01:56.09]She'll say that she's mine
[02:00.29]She'll say I'm not so tough
[02:04.04]Just because
[02:05.85]I'm in love
[02:07.49]With an uptown girl
[02:09.69]She's been living in her white bread world
[02:13.57]As long as anyone with hot blood can
[02:17.33]And now she's looking for a downtown man
[02:20.93]That's what I am
[02:22.65]Uptown girl
[02:24.70]She's my uptown girl
[02:28.06]You know I'm in love
[02:29.68]With an uptown girl
