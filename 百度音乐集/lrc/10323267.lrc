[00:15.35]Anthony works in the grocery store
[00:18.35]Saving his pennies for someday.
[00:21.92]Momma Leoni left a note on the door.
[00:25.27]She said, "Sonny, move out to the country.
[00:29.05]Working too hard can give you a heart attack;
[00:32.60]You oughtta know by now.
[00:36.40]Who need a house out in Hackensack?
[00:39.75]Is that all you get for your money?"
[00:43.31]It seems such a waste of time.
[00:47.00]If that's what it's all about...
[00:49.95]Momma, if that's moving up, than I'm moving out.

[01:10.87]Seargeant O'Leary is walking the beat.
[01:14.30]At night, he becomes a bartender.
[01:17.60]He works at Mr. Cacciatorre's down on Sullivant Street,
[01:21.45]Across from the medical center,
[01:24.77]And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac.
[01:28.54]You oughtta know by now,
[01:32.13]If he can't drive with a broken back,
[01:35.56]At least he can polish the fenders.
[01:38.83]And it seems such a waste of time,
[01:42.72]If that's what it's all about...
[01:45.41]Momma, if that's moving up, than I'm moving out.
[01:52.57]
[02:06.84]You should never argue with a crazy mind.
[02:10.22]You oughtta know by now,
[02:13.82]You can pay Uncle Sam with overtime
[02:17.35]Is that all you get for your money?
[02:20.87]And it seems such a waste of time.
[02:24.70]If that's what it's all about...
[02:28.03]Good luck moving up, cause I'm moving out.
