[00:05.50]Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,
[00:23.37]There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
[00:43.37]Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue,
[01:03.93]And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.
[01:24.18]Someday I'll wish upon a star
[01:29.12]And wake up where the clouds are far behind me,
[01:44.93]Where troubles melt like lemon drops.
[01:49.87]Away beyond the chimney tops
[01:55.30]That's where you'll find me.
[02:07.07]Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly,
[02:26.32]Birds fly over the rainbow,
[02:37.31]Why then, oh why can't I?
[03:04.50]Where troubles melt like lemon drops.
[03:07.07]Away beyond the chimney tops
[03:12.07]That's where you'll find me
[03:23.64]Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly,
[03:43.88]Birds fly over the rainbow,
[03:55.75]Why then, oh why can't I?
[04:04.64]If happy little bluebirds fly
[04:07.70]Beyond the rainbow,
[04:15.32]Why oh why can't I? you.
