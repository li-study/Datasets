[00:19.08]The dawn is breaking
[00:24.15]A light shining through
[00:29.49]You're barely waking
[00:34.10]And I'm tangled up in you
[00:38.57]Yeah
[00:41.07]
[00:51.88]But I'm open, you're closed
[00:55.04]Where I follow, you'll go
[01:00.49]I worry I won't see your face
[01:07.84]Light up again
[01:10.33]
[01:10.73]Even the best fall down sometimes
[01:15.25]Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
[01:20.40]Out of the doubt that fills my mind
[01:24.43]I somehow find, you and I collide
[01:33.01]
[01:42.47]I'm quiet, you know
[01:46.80]You make a first impression
[01:52.53]I've found I'm scared to know
[01:56.40]I'm always on your mind
[01:59.89]
[02:00.92]Even the best fall down sometimes
[02:05.87]Even the stars refuse to shine
[02:11.07]Out of the back you fall in time
[02:15.89]You somehow find, you and I collide
[02:24.17]
[02:27.72]Don't stop here
[02:30.35]I've lost my place
[02:35.29]I'm close behind
[02:38.45]
[02:55.91]Even the best fall down sometimes
[03:02.02]Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
[03:07.51]Out of the doubt that fills your mind
[03:11.92]You finally find, you and I collide
[03:19.71]
[03:24.68]You finally find
[03:26.35]You and I collide
[03:34.15]You finally find
[03:36.54]You and I collide
