[00:-1.67]Mamma mia

[00:02.78]A Teens
[00:15.43]I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
[00:21.83]So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
[00:28.68]Look at me now, will I ever learn?
[00:33.29]I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
[00:38.63]There's a fire within my soul
[00:42.19]Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
[00:45.69]One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
[00:50.37]Mamma mia, here I go again
[00:53.66]My my, how can I resist you?
[00:57.03]Mamma mia, does it show again?
[01:00.44]My my, just how much I've missed you
[01:03.68]Yes, I've been brokenhearted
[01:07.18]Blue since the day we parted
[01:10.44]Why, why did I ever let you go?
[01:13.84]Mamma mia, now I really know
[01:17.19]My my, I could never let you go
[01:20.66]Mamma mia, now I really know
[01:24.05]My my, I could never let you go
[01:28.93]
[01:39.69]I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
[01:45.28]I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
[01:51.90]And when you go, when you slam the door
[01:56.98]I think you know that you won't be away too long
[02:02.22]You know that I'm not that strong
[02:06.04]Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
[02:09.32]One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
[02:14.07]Mamma mia, here I go again
[02:17.42]My my, how can I resist you?
[02:20.69]Mamma mia, does it show again?
[02:23.75]My my, just how much I've missed you
[02:27.44]Yes, I've been brokenhearted
[02:30.82]Blue since the day we parted
[02:34.14]Why, why did I ever let you go?
[02:37.53]Mamma mia, even if I say
[02:40.91]Bye bye, leave me now or never
[02:44.29]Mamma mia, it's a game we play
[02:47.59]Bye bye doesn't mean forever
[02:51.11]Mamma mia, here I go again
[02:54.44]My my, how can I resist you?
[02:57.73]Mamma mia, does it show again?
[03:01.09]My my, just how much I've missed you
[03:04.41]Yes, I've been brokenhearted
[03:08.01]Blue since the day we parted
[03:11.16]Why, why did I ever let you go?
[03:14.42]Mamma mia, now I really know
[03:17.93]My my, I could never let you go
[03:21.31]Mamma mia, now I really know
[03:24.68]My my, I could never let you go
[03:28.13]Mamma mia, now I really know
[03:31.43]My my, I could never let you go
