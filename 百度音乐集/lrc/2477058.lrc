[00:02.20]Intro:
[00:02.70](Don't forget about us)
[00:04.10]Don't baby, donâ€™t baby, don't let it go
[00:07.30]No baby, no baby, no baby no
[00:10.70]Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
[00:13.60]My baby boy...
[00:15.60](Verse I)
[00:17.00]Just let it die
[00:18.60]With no goodbyes
[00:20.30]Details don't matter
[00:21.90]We both paid the price
[00:23.60]Tears in my eyes
[00:25.30]You know sometimes
[00:26.80]It'd be like that baby
[00:28.50](Bridge I)
[00:31.90]Now everytime I see you
[00:35.30]I pretend I'm fine
[00:38.30]When I wanna reach out to you
[00:41.90]But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
[00:45.40]Baby I must confess
[00:48.70]We were bigger than anything
[00:52.10]Remember us at our best
[00:55.80]And don't forget about
[00:57.80]Late nights, playin' in the dark
[01:00.70]And wakin' up inside my arms
[01:03.80]Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
[01:07.10]I can see it in your eyes
[01:08.60]You still want it
[01:09.50]So don't forget about us
[01:10.90]I'm just speaking from experience
[01:14.00]Nothing can compare to your first true love
[01:18.40]So I hope this will remind you
[01:20.90]When it's for real, it's forever
[01:22.20]So don't forget about us
[01:24.10](Verse II)
[01:24.50]Oh they say
[01:25.60]That you're in a new relationship
[01:27.40]But we both know
[01:28.90]Nothing comes close to
[01:30.60]What we had, it perseveres
[01:34.20]That we both can't forget it
[01:36.00]How good we used to get it
[01:37.20](Bridge II)
[01:38.80]There's only one me and you
[01:42.20]And how we used to shine
[01:45.50]No matter what you go through
[01:48.70]We are one, that's a fact
[01:50.50]That you can't deny
[01:52.30]So baby we just can't let
[01:55.60]The fire pass us by
[01:58.90]Forever we'd both regret
[02:02.80]So don't forget about
[02:03.60](Chorus)
[02:04.20]Late nights, playin' in the dark
[02:06.80]And wakin' up inside my arms
[02:09.80]Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
[02:14.30]I can see it in your eyes
[02:15.20]You still want it
[02:16.20]So don't forget about us
[02:17.40]I'm just speaking from experience
[02:21.00]Nothing can compare to your first true love
[02:24.50]So I hope this will remind you
[02:27.50]When it's for real, it's forever
[02:29.00]So don't forget about us
[02:29.70](Rap)
[02:31.20]And if she's got your head all messed up now
[02:33.00]That's the trickery
[02:34.30]She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
[02:37.80]I bet she can't do like me
[02:39.60]She'll never be MC
[02:41.30]Baby don't you, don't you forget about us
[02:43.30](Chorus)x2
[02:45.80]Late nights, playin' in the dark
[02:47.50]And wakin' up inside my arms
[02:50.80]Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
[02:53.90]I can see it in your eyes
[02:55.30]You still want it
[02:56.00]So don't forget about us
