[00:12.75]God, I feel like hell tonight
[00:17.35]Tears of rage I cannot fight
[00:21.55]I'd be the last to help you understand
[00:26.00]Are you strong enough to be my man?
[00:31.10]
[00:49.85]Nothing's true and nothing's right
[00:54.10]So let me be alone tonight
[00:59.00]Cause you can't change the way I am
[01:03.05]Are you strong enough to be my man?
[01:08.20]Lie to me
[01:12.60]I promise I'll believe
[01:17.55]Lie to me
[01:21.90]But please don't leave
[01:27.15]
[01:45.55]I have a face I cannot show
[01:49.95]I make the rules up as I go
[01:54.30]It's try and love me if you can
[01:58.60]Are you strong enough to be my man?
[02:03.00]......
[02:22.00]When I've shown you that I just don't care
[02:26.50]When I'm throwing punches in the air
[02:31.00]When I'm broken down and I can't stand
[02:35.55]Will you be strong enough to be my man?
[02:41.00]Lie to me
[02:44.90]I promise I'll believe
[02:50.20]Lie to me
[02:54.55]But please don't leave
[03:01.10]
