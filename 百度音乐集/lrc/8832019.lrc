[00:01.13]WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM - Expose
[00:02.48]
[00:27.28]I've never known someone before
[00:31.04]Who feels the way you do
[00:33.45]All my dreams somehow became true with you
[00:38.17]And I've never wanted someone more
[00:42.10]As much as I want you
[00:44.74]Love will last forever it's true with you
[00:50.97]I will always fear/Awaking in the night
[00:56.07]And not having you by my side
[01:00.90]It's not a dream
[01:03.36]We all need love and understanding
[01:06.82]We must break thru
[01:08.95]And make a love that's everlasting
[01:12.59]We'll be as one/I can see it in your eyes
[01:17.68]When I looked at him/And he turned to me
[01:23.23]He said you're more than a friend to love to need
[01:28.80]When I looked at him/And he held me so tight
[01:34.49]When I looked at him it's love eternally
[01:52.30]They say I should be acting cool
[01:55.95]They tell me I'm a fool
[01:58.26]They don't see the things I see in you
[02:04.57]We cannot forget the changes we've been thru
[02:09.80]I could never love someone new
[02:14.82]Don't say good-bye/It would tear in two my heart
[02:20.43]The time is right/We could never be apart
[02:26.13]We'll be as one I can see it in you eyes
[02:31.15]When I looked at him/And he turned to me
[02:36.46]He said you're more than a friend to love to need
[02:42.17]When I looked at him/And he held me so tight
[02:47.89]When I looked at him it's love eternally
[03:05.86]It's not a dream
[03:07.83]We all need love and understanding
[03:11.42]We must break thru
[03:13.36]And make a love that's everlasting
[03:17.11]We'll be as one/I can see it in your eyes
[03:26.34]When I looked at him/And he turned to me
[03:31.73]He said you're more than a friend to love to need
[03:37.55]When I looked at him/And he held me so tight
[03:43.03]When I looked at him it's love eternally
[03:48.82]When I looked at him/And he turned to me
[03:54.33]He said you're more than a friend to love to need
[03:59.97]When I looked at him/And he held me so tight
[04:05.69]When I looked at him it's love eternally
