[00:13.70]This is not the way I wanted things to be
[00:19.43]I hope someday you'll understand
[00:24.10]My heart beats stronger when I know I'm close to you
[00:29.97]It's helped me to be a better man
[00:34.29]
[00:36.87]Why must all of the love come falling
[00:42.64]Why don't we just take our chance
[00:47.11]I could walk this road again with you my love...oh, oh
[00:54.30]Why can't you come to me
[00:59.26]Don't save your love for some elusive dream
[01:06.01]Why can't you find your way
[01:11.02]I will fall for you no matter where it leads
[01:16.66]
[01:18.43]This is not the way we started, you and I
[01:23.89]How was it that I lost my way
[01:29.58]Two souls can drift apart without a word
[01:35.18]Were those the words I did not say
[01:40.71]
[01:41.80]Why must all of the dreams come falling
[01:47.67]Why don't we just take this chance

[02:21.05]
[02:45.43]I could walk this road again with you my love
[03:15.51][02:52.22]Why can't you come to me
[03:20.92][02:57.32]Don't save your love for some elusive dream
[03:27.50][03:03.93]Why can't you find your way
[03:32.98][03:09.35]I will fall for you no matter where it leads
