[00:07.46]
[00:09.79]If our love was a fairy tale
[00:13.49]I would charge in and rescue you
[00:17.31]On a yacht baby we would sail
[00:21.06]To an island where we’d say I do
[00:24.87]And if we had babies they would look like you
[00:28.77]It’d be so beautiful if that came true
[00:32.62]You don’t even know how very special you are
[00:37.48]Chorus
[00:38.51]You leave me breathless
[00:43.08]You’re everything good in my life
[00:46.09]You leave me breathless
[00:50.77]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[00:54.06]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[00:58.13]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[01:02.49]Breathless
[01:07.26]And if our love was a story book
[01:11.08]We would meet on the very first page
[01:14.98]The last chapter would be about
[01:18.70]How I’m thankful for the life we’ve made
[01:22.56]And if we had babies they would have your eyes
[01:27.06]I would fall deeper watching you give life
[01:30.32]You don’t even know how very special you are
[01:36.51]You’re everything good in my life
[01:43.70]You leave me breathless
[01:48.42]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[01:51.53]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[01:55.77]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[02:00.49]You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
[02:06.05]You’re like an angel
[02:08.70]The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
[02:13.62]You’re something special
[02:15.84]I only hope that I’ll one day deserve what you’ve given me
[02:21.10]But all I can do is try
[02:25.47]Every day of my life
[02:33.89]You leave me breathless
[02:38.42]You’re everything good in my life
[02:41.36]You leave me breathless
[02:46.09]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[02:49.17]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[02:53.45]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[02:57.81]Breathless
[02:59.98]You leave me breathless
[03:01.48]You’re everything good in my life
[03:04.50]You leave me breathless
[03:09.28]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[03:12.21]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[03:16.57]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[03:21.11]Breathless
