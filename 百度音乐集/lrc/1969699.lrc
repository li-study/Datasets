[00:01.81]When I Look To The Sky
[00:03.27]Train
[00:04.78]By Pevy Jane
[00:06.32]『When I look to the sky, I can see you Craig...』
[00:09.30]
[00:12.35]When it rains it pours and opens doors
[00:15.28]And floods the floors we thought would always
[00:19.53]keep us safe and dry
[00:24.09]And in the midst of sailing ships
[00:27.21]we sink our lips into the ones we love
[00:31.03]That have to say goodbye
[00:33.89]
[00:36.40]And as I float along this ocean
[00:42.24]I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go
[00:47.79]
[00:48.36]Cause when I look to the sky
[00:51.33]something tells me you're here with me
[00:55.79]And you make everything alright
[00:59.91]And when I feel like I'm lost
[01:02.73]something tells me you're here with me
[01:06.76]And I can always find my way when you are here
[01:11.43]
[01:23.74]And every word I didn't say
[01:26.78]that caught up in some busy day
[01:29.93]And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
[01:35.71]And every sunset that we'll miss
[01:38.62]I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
[01:41.68]And pick you up in all of this when I sail away
[01:46.60]
[01:48.02]While I float upon this ocean
[01:54.04]I can feel you like a notion that I hope for, I believe
[01:59.40]
[01:59.81]Cause when I look to the sky
[02:02.85]something tells me you're here with me
[02:07.59]And you make everything alright
[02:11.74]And when I feel like I'm lost
[02:14.76]something tells me you're here with me
[02:19.74]And I can always find my way
[02:22.66]
[02:23.30]Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead
[02:29.78]Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
[02:34.83]But with you I can spread my wings
[02:37.79]to see me over everything
[02:40.58]that life may send me when I am hoping it won't pass me by
[02:47.09]
[02:47.99]And when I feel like there is no one
[02:51.76]that will ever know me
[02:54.75]there you are to show me
[02:57.96]
[02:59.80]Cause when I look to the sky
[03:02.81]something tells me you're here with me
[03:07.63]And you make everything alright
[03:11.60]And when I feel like I'm lost
[03:14.68]something tells me you're here with me
[03:19.63]And I can always find my way when you are here
[03:22.84]
[03:23.77]Cause when I look to the sky
[03:26.83]something tells me you're here with me
[03:31.45]And I can always find my way when you are here
[03:35.66]And when I feel like I'm lost
[03:38.54]something tells me you're here with me
[03:43.48]And I can always find my way when you are here
[03:50.24]
[03:56.99]End
