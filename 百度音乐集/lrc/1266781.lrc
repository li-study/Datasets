[00:07.18]Mandy Moore - Gardenia
[00:28.80]Well, I put so much thought into getting ready
[00:36.42]Now I know that was the best part
[00:42.53]It's so easy to get caught up in what I'm regretting
[00:50.04]Forget what I got from a wounded heart
[00:56.71]I'm the one who likes Gardenia
[01:03.45]I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
[01:10.53]I don't want to hang up the phone yet
[01:17.74]It's been good
[01:21.30]Getting to know me more
[01:36.71]I've been seeing all my old friends in the city
[01:43.94]Walking alone in Central Park
[01:50.64]Doing all the things that I've neglected
[01:57.21]Traded 'em all in
[01:59.74]To be in your arms
[02:04.28]I'm the one who likes Gardenia
[02:10.82]I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
[02:17.81]I don't want to hang up the phone yet
[02:24.99]It's been good
[02:28.55]Getting to know me more
[02:57.65]Well, I hear my own voice
[03:00.80]Sounds so silly
[03:04.26]Keep on telling my story all around
[03:11.57]Everything I lost seems so different
[03:18.47]Well, this is how everybody gets found
[03:25.41]I'm the one who likes Gardenia
[03:32.78]I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
[03:39.37]I don't want to hang up the phone yet
[03:46.61]It's been good
[03:49.93]Getting to know me more
