[00:06.61]The book of love
[00:10.29]Peter Gabriel
[00:14.29]
[00:21.61]The book of love is long and boring
[00:26.69]No one can lift the damn thing
[00:32.39]Its full of charts facts and figures
[00:37.89]And instructions for dancing
[00:41.59]
[00:43.18]But I....I love it when you read to me
[00:53.87]And y..o..u  you can read me anything
[01:03.07]
[01:04.88]The book of love has music in it
[01:09.79]In fact that where music comes from
[01:15.55]Some of it is just transcendental
[01:21.49]Some of its just really dumb
[01:25.09]
[01:26.18]But I....I love it when you sing to me
[01:37.11]And y..o..u  you can sing me anything
[01:50.11]
[02:10.61]The book of love is long and boring
[02:16.19]and written very long ago
[02:21.89]Its full of flowers and heart shape boxes
[02:27.89]And things we are all to young to know
[02:31.09]
[02:32.38]But I....I love it when you give me things
[02:43.27]And y..o..u ought to give me wedding rings
[02:53.91]And I....I love it when you give me things
[03:05.27]And y..o..u ought to give me wedding rings
[03:17.27]
[03:22.88]You ought to give me wedding rings
[03:30.08]
[03:32.18]The end
