[00:12.93]("If I had a world of my own, everything will be nonsense")
[00:17.12]("Nothing will be what it is, because everything will be what it isn't")
[00:22.08]I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time
[00:27.52]And every creature lens themselves to change your state of mind
[00:32.20]And the girl that chase the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill
[00:37.29]Has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels
[00:43.26]To stand outside your virtue
[00:48.14]No one can ever hurt you
[00:53.25]Or so they say
[00:56.81]Her name is Alice (Alice)
[01:02.07]She crawls into the window
[01:05.20]Shaped in shadows
[01:07.81]Alice (Alice)
[01:12.22]And even though she is dreaming, she knows
[01:17.29]Sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain
[01:22.76]And every ounce of innocence is left inside her brain
[01:27.82]And through the looking glass we see she's painfully returned
[01:32.80]But now off with her head I fear is everyone's concern
[01:38.75]You see there's no real ending
[01:44.13]It's only the beginning
[01:48.76]Come out and play
[01:52.67]Her name is Alice (Alice)
[01:57.58]She crawls into to the window
[02:00.85]Shapes in shadows
[02:03.30]Alice (Alice)
[02:07.52]And even though she is dreaming
[02:10.61]She's a locked for meaning for you
[02:14.50]This kingdom good riddance good freedom and innocence
[02:24.18]Has brought this whole thing down
[02:33.18]Her name is Alice (Alice)
[02:37.83]She crawls into to the window
[02:41.27]Shapes in shadows
[02:43.78]Alice (Alice)
[02:48.10]And even though she is dreaming
[02:51.03]She's a locked for meaning
[03:10.61]She's a locked for meaning for you
[03:17.61]("In contrary was what it is it wouldn't be")
[03:21.45]("And what it wouldn't be it would")
[03:23.83]("You see?")
[03:28.24]End.
