[00:07.47]Once upon a time in a town no different to ours
[00:15.51]Where the stars don't shine and the birds don't sing
[00:22.90]And the only thoughts are that of stealing cars
[00:29.74]Or taking the next phone that rings
[00:36.42]You pull together in different ways
[00:43.21]Just to make it through the day
[00:49.94]And the people rise where the sun don't set
[00:56.96]And that's about as good as it gets
[00:59.87]But that's the way it is…
[01:03.52]
[01:17.62]Here's a story of a man and his volatile crimes
[01:20.29]He makes a quick getaway as the church bell chimes
[01:22.85]Looks down at his watch as his life flies by
[01:25.22]As the mother's they scream and they cry
[01:27.57]
[01:27.77]He's never really looked in the mirror before
[01:30.32]He's afraid of what he might see
[01:32.85]You know you get what you pay for
[01:35.24]And you don't get nothing for free
[01:37.83]In this life
[01:39.37]
[01:47.93]He's a short young man, living a short young life
[01:50.92]He wants to pay for his life of strife
[01:53.27]He knows what he's doing and he knows it's wrong
[01:55.55]But hey, it gives you reason to sing your song
[01:57.94]He's never really looked in the mirror before
[02:00.59]He's afraid of what he might see
[02:03.64]You know you get what you pay for
[02:05.57]And you don't get nothing for free
[02:08.14]But that's the way it is…
[02:19.79]
[02:33.45]And the boys in blue, well what do they do
[02:36.16]If it doesn't hurt you, then it doesn't affect you
[02:38.60]And these cunts hang out in groups on ten
[02:40.88]They like to hurt you when you hang out with your friends
[02:44.11]They never really look in the mirror before
[02:46.20]They're afraid of what they might see
[02:48.78]You know you get what you pay for
[02:51.09]And you don't get nothing for free
[02:53.30]But that's the way it is
[03:05.06]
[03:44.14]I can do what I wanna do
[03:46.76]I can see what I wanna see
[03:49.09]I can live how I wanna live
[03:51.30]I can be who I wanna be
[03:53.93]I can go where I wanna go
[03:56.51]I can know what I wanna no
[03:59.05]I'll be who I wanna be
[04:01.50]See who I wanna see
[04:05.08]
[04:08.74]End
[04:16.57]
