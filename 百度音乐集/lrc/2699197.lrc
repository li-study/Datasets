[00:00.90]SMASHING PUMPKINS LYRICS - Galapogos
[00:30.82]Ain't it funny
[00:38.60]how we pretend we're still a child
[00:47.14]Softly stolen under our blanket skies
[01:05.80]And rescue援救 me from me,
[01:11.52]and all that I believe
[01:15.65]I won't deny the pain
[01:23.64]I won't deny the change
[01:29.55]And should I fall from grace here with you
[01:33.45]Will you leave me too?
[01:51.80]Carve out your heart
[01:58.95]for keeps in an old oak橡树 tree
[02:07.69]And hold me for goodbyes-
[02:12.23]and whispered lullabyes
[02:25.49]And tell me I am still
[02:31.14]The man I'm supposed to be
[02:35.27]I won't deny the pain
[02:43.07]I won't deny the change
[02:48.80]And should I fall from grace here with you
[02:54.45]Will you leave me too?
[03:32.26]Too late to turn to turn back now,
[03:34.74]I'm running out of sound
[03:39.58]And I'm changing, changing
[03:47.36]And if we died right now,
[03:51.08]this fool you loved somehow
[03:54.80]Is here with you
[04:00.91]I won't deny the pain
[04:08.61]I won't deny the change
[04:14.48]And should I fall from grace
[04:17.85]here with you
[04:22.28]Would you leave me too?
[04:30.34]谨以此献给我热爱的碎瓜乐队！
