[00:01.47]I Honestly Love You
[00:09.77]
[00:22.10]Maybe i hang around here
[00:24.72]A little more than i should
[00:28.44]We both know i got somewhere else to go
[00:34.26]But i got something to tell you
[00:39.32]That i never thought i would
[00:43.31]But i believe you really ought to know
[00:50.39]
[00:52.29]I love you
[00:56.78]I honestly love you
[01:01.03]
[01:05.10]You don't have to answer
[01:07.83]I see it in your eyes
[01:11.07]Maybe it was better left unsaid
[01:17.71]This is pure and simple
[01:22.24]And you should realize
[01:25.49]That it's coming from my heart and not my head
[01:32.86]
[01:34.76]I love you
[01:39.40]I honestly love you
[01:45.86]
[01:47.76]I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
[01:53.66]I'm not trying to make you anything at all
[01:59.85]But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
[02:07.67]And you shouldn't blow the chance
[02:11.93]When you've got the chance to say
[02:15.82]
[02:17.54]I love you
[02:21.90]I love you
[02:29.25]I honestly love you
[02:34.22]
[02:37.42]If we both were born
[02:40.68]In anoother place and time
[02:43.72]This moment might be ending in a kiss
[02:51.29]But there you are with yours
[02:54.24]And here i am with mine
[02:57.95]So i guess we'll just be leaving it at this
[03:05.66]
[03:07.63]I love you
[03:11.12]I honestly love you
[03:19.32]I honestly love you
