[00:07.10]
[00:17.35]From the first time that I heard you I knew
[00:24.37]I'd be hooked on you forever like the blues
[00:31.47]People told me you would hurt me, so untrue
[00:36.89]Cos after all these years, you're the one thing thats still here
[00:45.33]Cos of you there's no alone
[00:48.78]You've been with me through it all
[02:49.23][01:54.01][00:51.04]
[03:18.35][02:50.09][01:54.30][00:51.28]Never Never Never Never gonna give you up
[03:22.79][02:54.81][01:58.90][00:56.11]running through my blood
[03:24.91][02:56.91][02:00.96][00:58.20]Never Never Never Never leaving you behind
[03:29.85][03:01.88][02:05.97][01:03.17]Always on my mind
[03:31.85][03:03.91][02:07.98][01:05.12]Can't get enough of your highs and your lows
[03:35.35][03:07.42][02:11.35][01:08.65]You take me places where nobody goes
[03:38.62][03:10.65][02:14.68][01:11.90]And if you went away, I would never be the same
[03:46.52][01:20.33]
[01:20.80]Oh your sweetness is like sugar on my lips
[01:27.24]When you're not around its your melody that I miss
[01:34.30]Like an old friend you come back to me so quick
[01:39.74]And after all this time I've still got you in my life
[01:47.06]You and me we're going strong
[01:51.68]You and me we still belong
