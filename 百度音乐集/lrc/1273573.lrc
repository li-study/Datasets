[00:11.10]It\'s so hard to say that I\'m sorry I\'ll make everything alright
[00:21.93]all these things that I\'ve done now what have I become and where they go wrong
[00:32.68]I dont mean to hurt just to put you first I wont tell you lies (I\'m sorry)
[00:43.75]I will stand accused with my hand on my heart, I\'m just trying to say;
[00:51.14]
[00:52.29]I\'m sorry, it\'s all that I can say
[01:01.65]you mean so much and I\'d fix all that I\'ve done, if I could start again
[01:12.58]I threw it all away, to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me
[01:32.22]
[01:42.81]I know that I can\'t take back all the of the mistakes but I will try
[01:53.77]although it\'s not easy I know you believe me cause I would not lie
[02:02.25]
[02:04.22]don\'t believe the lies, told from jealous eyes they dont understand (I\'m sorry)
[02:15.20]I will break your heart, I will bring you down, but I will have to say;
[02:22.49]
[02:23.77]I\'m sorry, it\'s all that I can say
[02:33.32]you mean so much and I\'d fix all that I\'ve done, if I could start again
[02:43.91]I threw it all away, to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me
[03:03.20]
[03:30.49]I\'m sorry, it\'s all that I can say
[03:39.98]you mean so much and I\'d fix all that I\'ve done, if I could start again
[03:50.67]I threw it all away, to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me
