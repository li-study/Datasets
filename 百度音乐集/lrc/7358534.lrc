[00:09.92]Quincy Jones and JamesIngram
[00:11.76]
[00:13.76]I did my best
[00:16.35]But i guess my best wasn't good enough
[00:19.46]'Cause here me are back where we were before
[00:25.44]Seems nothing ever changes
[00:29.72]We're back to being strangers
[00:33.33]Wondering if we ought to stay
[00:36.07]Or head on out the door
[00:41.41]Just once
[00:44.35]can we figure out what we Keep doing wrong
[00:50.81]Why we never last for very long
[00:57.16]What are we doing wrong
[01:00.61]Just once
[01:04.44]can we find a way to finally make it right
[01:10.99]To make the magic last for more than just one night
[01:17.91]If we could just get to it
[01:21.40]I know we could break through it
[01:30.89]
[01:38.62]I gave my all
[01:41.27]But I think my all may have been too much
[01:44.35]'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
[01:50.21]Seems we're always blowing Whatever we got going
[01:57.77]And it seems at times with all we've got
[02:00.99]We haven't got a prayer
[02:06.92]Just once
[02:09.28]Can we figure out what we keep doing wrong
[02:14.28]Why the good times never last for long
[02:22.22]What are we doing wrong
[02:25.30]Just once
[02:29.30]Can we find a way to finally make it right
[02:34.81]To make the magic last for more than just one night
[02:42.56]I know we could break through it
[02:45.98]If we could just get to it just once
[02:52.34]I want to understand
[02:55.37]why it always comes back to goodbye
[03:03.32]Why can't we give ourselves a hand
[03:08.52]and admit to one another
[03:12.61]We're no good without each other
[03:16.22]Take the best and make it better
[03:19.30]Find a way to stay together
[03:22.88]Just once
[03:26.51]Can we find a way to finally make it right
[03:31.96]To make the magic last for more than just one night
[03:39.38]I know we could break through it If we could just get to it
[03:45.25]Just once
[03:54.26]Oh we can get to it
[04:01.00]Just once
[04:10.27]
