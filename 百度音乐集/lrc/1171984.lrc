[00:05.72]
[00:07.72]Young girl, don't cry
[00:10.24]I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
[00:21.31]Young girl, it's all right
[00:23.81]Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly
[00:29.92]
[00:34.20]When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream
[00:40.93]Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
[00:47.84]No one ever wants or bothers to explain
[00:54.63]Of the heartache life can bring and what it means
[01:01.25]
[03:39.96][02:30.42][01:01.57]When there's no one else
[03:43.44][02:33.69][01:04.77]Look inside yourself
[03:47.22][02:37.44][01:08.71]Like your oldest friend
[03:50.43][02:40.07][01:11.77]Just trust the voice within
[03:53.98][02:44.08][01:15.30]Then you'll find the strength
[03:57.04][02:47.12][01:18.54]That will guide your way
[04:01.14][02:50.94][01:22.39]If you will learn to begin
[04:04.08][02:54.15][01:25.80]To trust the voice within
[04:12.94][02:59.42][01:34.24]
[01:36.59]Young girl, don't hide
[01:39.07]You'll never change if you just run away
[01:50.06]Young girl, just hold tight
[01:52.86]And soon you're gonna see your brighter day
[01:59.33]
[02:02.81]Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
[02:09.66]It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid
[02:16.46]No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
[02:23.34]When you're lost outside look inside to your soul
[02:30.22]
[03:01.46]Yeah...
[03:12.84]Life is a journey
[03:14.58]It can take you anywhere you choose to go
[03:19.11]As long as you're learning
[03:21.26]You'll find all you'll ever need to know
[03:25.03]
[03:26.12]You'll make it
[03:27.56]You'll make it
[03:29.57]Just don't go forsaking yourself
[03:34.82]No one can stop you
[03:36.17]You know that I'm talking to you
[03:38.80]
[04:15.87]Young girl don't cry
[04:17.87]I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
[04:24.37]
