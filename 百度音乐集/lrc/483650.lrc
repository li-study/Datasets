[00:02.39]Miranda Lambert
[00:03.64]
[00:20.69]I know they say you can't go home again
[00:27.68]I just had to come back one last time
[00:33.29]Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam
[00:39.11]But these handprints on the front steps are mine
[00:43.64]
[00:44.42]Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
[00:50.65]Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
[00:56.68]I bet you didn't know under that live oak
[01:02.59]My favorite dog is buried in the yard
[01:07.28]
[01:08.75]I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
[01:14.58]This brokenness inside me might start healing
[01:20.41]Out here it's like I'm someone else
[01:23.58]I thought that maybe I could find myself
[01:29.61]If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
[01:34.38]Won't take nothing but a memory
[01:38.08]From the house that built me
[01:44.18]
[01:47.13]Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
[01:53.22]From Better Homes and Gardens magazine
[01:58.50]Plans were drawn and concrete poured
[02:01.36]Nail by nail and board by board
[02:05.96]Daddy gave life to mama's dream
[02:09.68]
[02:10.96]I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
[02:16.75]This brokenness inside me might start healing
[02:22.61]Out here it's like I'm someone else
[02:25.64]I thought that maybe I could find myself
[02:31.81]If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
[02:36.75]Won't take nothing but a memory
[02:40.28]From the house that built me
[02:47.27]
[02:49.50]You leave home and you move on and you do the best you can
[02:55.48]I got lost in this old world and forgot who I am
[03:03.62]
[03:04.53]I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
[03:10.15]This brokenness inside me might start healing
[03:15.90]Out here it's like I'm someone else
[03:19.23]I thought that maybe I could find myself
[03:25.39]If I could walk around I swear I'll leave
[03:30.03]Won't take nothing but a memory
[03:33.51]From the house that built me
[03:40.99]
