[00:03.86]Natasha Bedingfield
[00:06.36]Backyard
[00:12.87]It's been too long
[00:14.40]Don't think I've seen you smile
[00:16.74]at me for quite a while
[00:19.73]And we're too busy doing things
[00:22.95]We haven't noticed what's missing
[00:26.17]Where's the fun we used to have?
[00:29.50]My childish ways and your sarcasm
[00:32.53]Silly jokes and fairy tales
[00:36.04]Where did we leave them?
[00:39.44]Lost in the backyard
[00:46.22]Your lasso my tiara
[00:50.00]My wand, your plastic bazooka
[00:53.58]Why can't we be how we were
[00:56.59]In the backyard
[00:59.99]Your cowboy hat, my tutu
[01:03.27]You hide and seek, I catch you
[01:06.75]Why can't we be how we
[01:09.50]were in the backyard
[01:16.57]Simple days of hand in hand
[01:19.60]And drawing our names in the sand
[01:23.03]Somehow life just complicates
[01:25.91]Our buried treasure it just waits
[01:29.89]Lost in the backyard
[01:36.76]Your lasso my tiara
[01:40.76]My wand, your plastic bazooka
[01:44.12]Why can't we be how we were
[01:47.13]In the backyard
[01:50.68]Your cowboy hat, my tutu
[01:54.08]You hide and seek, I catch you
[01:57.38]Why can't we be how we
[02:00.43]were in the backyard
[02:03.17]in the backyard
[02:07.45]Hah hah hah hah...
[02:22.46]Lost you in the backyard
[02:33.00]You can still meet me in the garden
[02:36.49]You and I and hide behind the rosebed
[02:43.29]You and I
[02:44.47]You and I
[02:45.57]Lost in the backyard again
[02:51.29]Your lasso my tiara
[02:54.34]My wand, your plastic bazooka
[02:57.77]Why can't we be how we were
[03:00.85]In the backyard
[03:04.37]Your cowboy hat, my tutu
[03:07.59]You hide and seek, I catch you
[03:11.05]Why can't we be how we were
[03:14.35]In the backyard
[03:17.17]In the backyard
[03:20.62]End
