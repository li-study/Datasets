[00:03.72]Brought to you by McSilence
[00:08.50]Blue moon,
[00:16.10]you saw me standing alone
[00:22.33]without a dream in my heart
[00:28.30]
[00:30.68]without a love on my own.
[00:34.94]
[00:39.91]Blue moon,
[00:45.68]you knew just what I was there for
[00:52.74]you heard me saying a prayer for
[00:59.69]someone I realy could care for.
[01:07.99]
[01:10.47]And then there suddenly appeared before me,
[01:19.36]the only one my arms could ever hold
[01:26.40]I heard somebody whisper,
[01:31.63]"Please adore me."
[01:34.70]and when I looked,
[01:37.59]the moon had turned to gold.
[01:43.27]Blue moon,
[01:47.52]now I'mno longer alone
[01:55.70]without a dream in my heart
[02:04.57]without a love on my own.
[02:11.73]
[02:45.41]Blue moon,
[02:51.96]now I no longer alone
[03:00.18]without a dream in my heart
[03:08.47]without a love on my own.
[03:14.78]
[03:17.62]without a dream in my heart
