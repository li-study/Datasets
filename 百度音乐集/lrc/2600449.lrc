[00:13.26]I woke up and he was screaming
[00:21.66]I'd left him dreaming
[00:25.56]I roll over and shake him tightly
[00:31.48]And whisper "if they want you
[00:34.52]Oh they're gonna have to fight me"
[00:37.71]Oh fight me
[00:40.35]
[00:43.07]I woke up on a bench on Shepherds Bush green
[00:48.75]Oh a candle at my chest and a hand on his knee
[00:55.83]I got up it was dark
[00:57.88]Theres no one in the park at this time
[01:00.20]How do I keep finding myself here?
[01:04.91]Oh fight me
[01:07.54]
[01:10.30]If I look back and he's screaming
[01:18.62]I'd left him dreaming, the dangers fade
[01:22.72]And I roll back and shake him tightly
[01:29.16]And scream "if they want him oh they're gonna have to fight me"
[01:35.37]Oh fight me
[01:38.19]
[01:40.36]But if I wake up on a bench on Shepherds Bush green
[01:46.53]Oh a candle at my chest and a hand on his knee
[01:53.48]I'll roll over and hold him tightly
[02:00.66]And scream "if you want him oh your gonna have to fight me"
[02:07.61]Oh fight me
[02:10.10]
