[00:01.83]And I Love You So
[00:03.47]Don McLean
[00:05.84]
[00:11.16]And I love you so
[00:16.81]The people ask me how
[00:21.65]How I've lived till now
[00:26.77]I tell them I don't know
[00:31.82]I guess they understand
[00:36.65]How lonely life has been
[00:42.41]But life began again
[00:47.36]The day you took my hand
[00:51.19]
[00:54.46]And yes I know how lonely life can be
[01:06.17]The shadows follow me
[01:09.65]And the night won't set me free
[01:11.78]
[01:17.05]But I don't let the evening get me down
[01:26.31]Now that you're around me
[01:32.88]
[02:09.01]And you love me too
[02:14.07]Your thoughts are just for me
[02:20.00]You set my spirit free
[02:25.21]I'm happy that you do
[02:27.28]
[02:30.89]The book of life is brief
[02:36.17]And once a page is read
[02:42.02]All but love is dead
[02:47.77]That is my believe
[02:50.43]
[02:54.17]And yes I know how loveless life can be
[03:06.11]The shadows follow me
[03:09.99]And the night won't set me free
[03:11.98]
[03:17.24]And I don't let the evening bring me down
[03:26.48]Now that you're around me
[03:36.93]And I love you so
[03:43.27]The people ask me how
[03:48.05]How I've lived till now
[03:53.09]I tell them...I don't know
[04:02.55]
