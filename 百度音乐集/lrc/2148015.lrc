[00:00.00]Backstreet Boys---Spanish Eyes
[00:16.00]Here we are in the arms of one another
[00:23.00]And we still go on searching for each other
[00:29.00]Knowing that hate is wrong
[00:33.00]and love is right for us tonight
[00:41.00]When I look into your Spanish eyes
[00:48.00]I know the reason why I am alive
[00:55.00]And the world is so beautiful tonight
[01:00.00]It's a place I've never been
[01:03.00]And it comes from deep within
[01:07.00]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
[01:14.00]Knowing all I have to do
[01:17.00]Is reach out my hand to you
[01:21.00]Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
[01:30.00]Let it be if nothing more than dreamers
[01:37.00]Who believe that we see no wall between us
[01:44.00]How can they be in my heart and in my mind
[01:51.00]when all I could find
[01:55.00]When I look into your Spanish eyes
[02:03.00]I know the reason why I am alive
[02:10.00]And the world is so beautiful tonight
[02:14.00]It's a place I've never been
[02:18.00]And it comes from deep within
[02:22.00]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
[02:29.00]Knowing all I have to do
[02:32.00]Is reach out my hand to you
[02:36.00]Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
[02:45.00]I loved you from a distance thought
[02:49.00]I couldn't reach that far
[02:52.00]I can't believe how close that we are
[02:59.00]When I look into your Spanish eyes
[03:10.00]And the world is so beautiful tonight
[03:15.00]It's a place I've never been
[03:18.00]And it comes from deep within
[03:22.00]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
