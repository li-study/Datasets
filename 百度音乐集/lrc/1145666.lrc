[00:00.00]Eric Clapton - old Love
[00:01.00]
[00:34.84]I can feel your body
[00:41.10]When I'm lying in bed
[00:48.94]There's too much confusion
[00:56.09]Going around through my head
[00:59.42]
[01:03.11]And it makes me so angry
[01:09.03]To know that the flame still burns
[01:17.23]Why can't I get over?
[01:22.51]When will I ever learn?
[01:25.53]
[01:29.64]Old love
[01:36.71]leave me alone
[01:44.11]Old love
[01:50.62]just go on home
[01:52.88]
[02:00.65]I can see your face
[02:07.88]But I know that it's not real
[02:14.96]It's just an illusion
[02:21.83]Caused by how I used to feel
[02:26.89]
[02:28.40]And it makes me so angry
[02:33.76]I know that the flame will always burn
[02:38.75]the flame will always burn
[02:43.19]I'll never get over
[02:48.73]I know now that I'll never learn {^never learn^}
[02:51.43]
[02:55.92]Old love
[03:03.06]leave me alone
[03:10.30]Old love
[03:16.66]just go on home {^go on home^}
[03:22.00]
