[00:00.00]You're sleeping i'm not sleeping and there's miles of night
[00:05.00]I see something shining where there is no light
[00:09.00]I just want to bury it and throw away the weeds when they grow
[00:15.00][00:29.00][00:48.00][01:02.00][01:41.00][01:55.00][02:09.00]What makes me so mad?
[00:19.00][02:00.00]That scream to wake the birds is only my heart beating
[00:33.00]Translucent skin i'm looking in i feel a ghost
[00:38.00]Scared away and left the one i need the most
[00:43.00]I just want to bury it and leave my tears to sink in the grave
[00:53.00]The shouting in my room is only my heart beating
[01:07.00]The heart beat calls my name the pattern on my thumb
[01:16.00]The waiting and the dream have all turned into one
[01:25.00]You're sleeping i'm not sleeping and i wonder why
[01:30.00]I love to think about the time before the light
[01:35.00]I didn't want to bury it and lift my head up into the sky
[01:45.00]The bass drum through the floor is only my heart beating
