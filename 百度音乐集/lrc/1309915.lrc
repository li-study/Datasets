[00:00.00]Sheryl Crow - Over You
[00:13.00]
[00:27.74]I feel like cherry wine
[00:30.02]Like Valentines
[00:31.98]Like a Spring is coming
[00:35.03]And everything is all right
[00:41.26]I've got a love that's new
[00:43.85]I hear you're happy too
[00:45.50]That's the way it should be
[00:48.44]But lately I feel like crying
[01:56.96][00:55.05]I wanna get over you
[02:01.67][00:58.98]But you're everywhere
[02:03.21][01:00.66]And I just can't get away
[02:10.17][01:07.58]I gotta get over you
[02:15.22][01:12.31]Cause it's just not fair
[02:16.81][01:14.27]That I can still see your face
[01:20.05]
[01:29.25]I heard your name today
[01:31.22]AndI walked away
[01:32.86]Cause everyone's still talking
[01:35.94]I don't need that in my life
[01:42.39]Got better things to do
[01:44.68]Than worry about you
[01:46.36]I'm gonna keep on walking
[01:49.37]But sometimes I don't know why
[02:22.13]
[02:24.44]Well we had a good time
[02:27.06]But time goes on
[02:31.02]You didn't really want me until I was gone
[02:39.24]
[03:04.42]I wanna get over you
[03:09.07]Before you get over me
[03:13.77]Over me
[03:18.20]I wanna get over you
[03:22.12]But you just want let me
[03:24.59]And I get away
[03:31.65]I gotta get over you
[03:36.17]But I can't forgive you
[03:38.24]Since that I said
[03:41.80]It's still ringing my ear
[03:45.15]And I wanna get over you
[03:49.98]But you always ?
[03:52.25]And I,I just cant' get away
[03:59.27]I want get over you
[04:04.04]Cause someone find that
[04:06.69]I still can see your face
[04:12.68]
