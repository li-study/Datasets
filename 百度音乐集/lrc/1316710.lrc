[00:15.51]Yeah. Yeah.
[00:17.62]Ooh, Ooh, Ohh
[00:24.97]
[00:25.49]If you see me walking down the street
[00:27.71]Or in the pages of your magzine
[00:29.90]Looking just a little differently
[00:32.37]Showing off a softer side of me
[00:35.06]
[00:35.44]They saying I'm looking like a lady
[00:37.45]They saying that love is going to change me
[00:39.99]But don't be fooled by everything you see
[00:42.65]Gotta let the naughty in me free
[00:45.07]
[00:45.55]There's a woman inside of all of us
[00:47.76]Who never quite seems to get enough
[00:50.38]Trying to play by the rules is rough
[00:53.03]Cause sooner or later something's going to erupt
[00:55.82]
[00:56.19]Cause I still got that nasty in me
[00:58.16]Still got that dirrty degree (still got it)
[01:00.79]And if you want some more sexy
[01:03.12]Still got that freak in me
[01:05.82]I still got that nasty in me
[01:08.36]Still got that dirrty degree (oh yeah)
[01:11.00]And if you want some more sexy
[01:13.32]Still got that freak in me
[01:15.69]
[01:16.28]No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
[01:18.59]And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
[01:21.06]No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
[01:23.43]Still got that freak in me
[01:25.32]
[01:25.80]Why is a woman's sexuality
[01:28.09]Always under so much scrutiny?
[01:30.41]Why can't she do exactly as she please
[01:33.22]Without being called a million things?
[01:35.69]
[01:36.08]They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know)
[01:38.51]'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh)
[01:41.02]But don't be fooled a moment, I can't hold (I can't hold)
[01:43.81]I'm letting loose, 'cause then I'd probably choke (don't you know)
[01:47.00]
[01:47.22]There's some women out there who talk and stare
[01:49.02]Who never seem to let down their hair
[01:51.13]Like to past judgement, but they're just scared
[01:53.60]And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware
[01:56.32]
[01:56.57]'Cause I still got that nasty in me
[01:58.60]Still got that dirrty degree (ooh)
[02:01.14]And if you want some more sexy
[02:03.74]Still got that freak in me
[02:06.45]I still got that nasty in me
[02:08.77]Still got that dirrty degree (oh yeah)
[02:11.36]And if you want some more sexy
[02:13.87]Still got that freak in me (oh yeah)
[02:16.30]
[02:16.70]No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
[02:19.15]And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
[02:21.63]No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
[02:23.99]Still got that freak in me
[02:26.16]
[02:26.56]Don't tell me to behave
[02:28.85]'Cause I'll never play that game (no)
[02:31.35]Don't tell me what to do
[02:33.85]'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
[02:36.80]Don't look at me that way
[02:39.10]'Cause I ain't never gonna change
[02:41.60]And if you're talking about my life
[02:44.11]You're only wasting your own time
[02:46.41]
[02:46.67]If I want to wear lingere outside of my clothes
[02:49.36]If I want to be erotic in my own videos
[02:51.77]If I want to be provacative, well that ain't a sin
[02:54.24]Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin
[02:56.76]
[02:57.11]I still got that nasty in me
[03:02.05]Still got that dirrty degree (in me)
[03:02.43]And if you still want some more sexy
[03:04.29]Still got that freak in me
[03:06.85]I still got that nasty in me
[03:09.43]Still got that dirrty degree (in me)
[03:12.26]And if you still want some more sexy
[03:14.61]Still got freak in me
[03:17.05]
[03:17.44]Ooh, yeah.
[03:19.33]Hey, hey, hey.
[03:22.35]Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh.
[03:28.19]
