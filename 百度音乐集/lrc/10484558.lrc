[00:05.58]There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
[00:14.73]A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
[00:23.77]She is a special one, she's never seen the sun
[00:29.20]She only comes out when the moon is on the run
[00:32.65]And all the stars are gleaming
[00:39.76]She's growing in the street right up through the concrete
[00:45.62]But soft and sweet and dreamin'
[00:53.19]There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
[01:02.65]A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
[01:11.71]With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
[01:16.89]And starts a fire there and then I lose control
[01:20.63]I have to beg your pardon
[01:27.91]I'm going to pick that rose and watch her as she grows
[01:34.33]in my garden
[01:41.00]
[02:27.28]There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
[02:35.91]A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
[02:44.94]With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
[02:50.08]And starts a fire there and then I lose control
[02:53.69]I have to beg your pardon
[03:00.47]I'm going to pick that rose and watch her as she grows
[03:07.49]in my garden
[03:13.65]I'm going to pick that rose and watch her as she grows
[03:20.74]in my garden
