[00:05.00]There are many many crazy things
[00:11.70]That will keep me loving you
[00:18.80]And with your permission
[00:21.80]May I list a few
[00:29.00]The way you wear your hat
[00:33.95]The way you sip your tea
[00:38.30]The memory of all that
[03:21.19][03:06.10][00:42.50]No they can't take that away from me
[00:48.35]The way your smile just beams
[00:53.05]The way you sing off key
[00:57.90]The way you haunt my dreams
[01:40.50][01:02.00]No no, they can't take that away from me
[02:35.50][01:09.25]We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
[02:44.30][01:18.50]But I'll always, always keep the memory of
[02:52.35][01:26.70]The way you hold your knife
[02:57.15][01:31.55]The way we danced till three
[03:01.90][01:36.30]The way you changed my life
[01:47.10]Nooo, they can't take that away from me
[03:11.90]Nooo, they can't take that away
[03:17.30]No they cannot take that away
