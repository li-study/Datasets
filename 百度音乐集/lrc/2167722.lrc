[00:26.57]It's not easy
[00:30.09]Trying to understand
[00:32.52]How the world can be so cold
[00:35.24]Stealing the souls of man
[00:39.09]Cloudy skies rain down
[00:42.03]On all your dreams
[00:44.94]You wrestle with the fear and doubt
[00:47.05]Sometimes it's hard, but you gotta believe
[00:50.30]
[00:50.94]There's a better place
[00:54.24]Where our Father waits
[00:57.47]And every tear
[00:59.72]He'll wipe away
[01:03.60]The darkness will be gone
[01:06.38]The weak shall be strong
[01:09.83]Hold on to your faith
[01:14.76]There will come a day
[01:21.37]There will come a day
[01:25.72]
[01:28.12]Wars are raging
[01:31.17]Lives are scattered
[01:34.52]Innocence is lost
[01:36.65]And hopes are shattered
[01:40.50]The old are forgotten
[01:44.42]The children are forsaken
[01:46.68]In this world we're living in
[01:49.06]Isn't anything sacred
[01:51.83]
[01:52.88]There's a better place
[01:55.98]Where our Father waits
[01:58.64]And every tear
[02:01.55]He'll wipe away
[02:05.42]The darkness will be gone
[02:08.44]The weak shall be strong
[02:12.16]Hold on to your faith
[02:16.52]There will come a day
[02:23.05]There will come a day
[02:26.89]
[02:45.70]Song will ring out
[02:48.72]Down those golden streets
[02:51.71]The voices of earth
[02:53.98]The angels will sing
[02:58.26]Every knee will bow
[03:01.44]Sin will have no trace
[03:05.44]In the glory of His amazing grace
[03:10.21]Every knee will bow
[03:13.21]Sin will have no trace
[03:16.67]In the glory of His amazing grace
[03:22.09]There will come a day
[03:28.05]There will come a day
[03:32.72]Oh, there will come a day
[03:38.30]There will come a day
[03:41.14]I know there's coming a day
[03:43.18]Coming a day
