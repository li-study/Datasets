[00:00:00]Breaking The Habit
[00:02:00]Linkin park
[00:06:00]

[00:20.17]Memories concern
[00:22.69]Like opening the wound
[00:25.22]I'm picking me apart again
[00:29.50]You all assume
[00:32.20]I'm safer in my room
[00:34.63]Unless I try to start again
[00:38.70]I don't want to be the one
[00:40.87]Who battles always choose
[00:43.05]Course  inside I realize
[00:45.63]That I'm the one confused
[00:47.96]I don't know what's worth fighting for
[00:50.43]Or why I have to scream
[00:52.68]I don't know why I instigate
[00:55.16]And say what I don't mean
[00:57.40]I don't know how I got this way
[01:00.03]I know it's not alright
[01:01.92]So I'm breaking the habit
[01:07.08]I'm breaking the habit tonight
[01:12.44]
[01:17.44]Cultured my cure
[01:20.46]I tightly lock the door
[01:22.64]I try to catch my breath again
[01:27.37]I hurt much more
[01:29.97]Than anytime before
[01:32.15]I have no options left again
[01:36.26]I dont want to be the one
[01:38.39]Who battles always choose
[01:40.64]Course inside I realize
[01:43.08]That I'm the one confused
[01:45.48]I don't know what's worth fighting for
[01:47.92]Or why I have to scream
[01:50.20]I don't know why I instigate
[01:52.68]And say what I don't mean
[01:54.93]I don't know how I got this way
[01:57.59]I'll never be alright
[01:59.50]So, I'm breaking the habit
[02:04.64]I'm breaking the habit tonight
[02:10.77]I'll paint it on the walls
[02:15.40]Course I'm the one that falls
[02:20.27]I'll never fight again
[02:25.16]And this is how it ends
[02:28.66]I don't know what's worth fighting for
[02:31.25]Or why I have to scream
[02:33.46]But now I have some clarity
[02:35.93]to show you what I mean
[02:38.18]I don't know how I got this way
[02:40.81]I'll never be alright
[02:42.68]So, I'm breaking the habit
[02:47.74]I'm breaking the habit
[02:52.62]I'm breaking the habit tonight
[02:58.22]
