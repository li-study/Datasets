[00:02.00]Broken Bells - The High Road
[00:10.00]
[00:24.67]We're bound to wait all night.
[00:28.68]She's bound to run amok.
[00:31.43]Invested enough in it anyhow,
[01:47.22][00:35.14]To each his own...
[00:37.42]The Garden needs sorting out.
[00:40.53]She curls her lips on the bow,
[00:43.61]And I don't know if I'm dead or not,
[01:59.27][00:47.06]To anyone...
[00:49.18]Come on and get the minimum,
[02:04.61][00:52.55]Before you open up your eyes.
[00:55.61]This army has so many heads,
[00:58.91]To analyze...
[02:13.79][01:01.92]Come on and get your overdose.
[02:16.51][01:04.64]Collect it at the borderline,
[02:19.36][01:07.46]And they want to get up in your head...
[02:23.77][01:11.54]Cause they know and so do I.
[02:29.32][01:17.21]The high road is hard to find.
[02:35.29][01:23.50]A detour to your new life.
[02:41.37][01:29.55]Tell all of your friends goodbye.
[01:36.76]The dawn to end all nights,
[01:40.50]That's all we hoped it was.
[01:43.32]A break from the warfare in your house,
[01:49.27]A soldier is bailing out.
[01:52.67]He curled his lips on the barrel.
[01:55.55]And I don't know if the dead can talk,
[02:01.68]Come on and get the minimum.
[02:07.49]This army has so many hands,
[02:10.44]Are you one of us?
[03:35.52][03:24.06][03:11.70][02:59.56]It's too late to change your mind,
[03:41.01][03:29.10][03:17.12][03:05.21]You let loss be your guide.
