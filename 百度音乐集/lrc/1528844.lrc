[00:00]MINORITY
[00:02]Compose / Lyrics / Vocal / Green Day.
[00:04]
[00:06]I want to be the minority
[00:10]I don't need your authority
[00:14]Down with the moral majority
[00:17]`cause I want to be the minority
[00:20]I pledge allegiance to the underworld
[00:24]One nation under dog
[00:25]There of which I stand alone
[00:27]A face in the crowd
[00:29]Unsung, against the mold
[00:31]Without a doubt,
[00:32]Singled out
[00:33]The only way I know
[00:34]I want to be the minority
[00:38]I don't need your authority
[00:41]Down with the moral majority
[00:45]`cause I want to be the minority
[00:48]Stepped out of the line
[00:52]Like a sheep runs from the herd
[00:55]Marching out of time
[00:59]To my own beat now
[01:02]The only way I know
[01:54][01:04]One light, one mind
[01:56][01:05]Flashing in the dark
[01:58][01:07]Blinded by silence of a thousand broken hearts
[02:01][01:11]"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me
[02:05][01:14]A free for all
[02:06][01:15]Fuck em all
[02:07][01:16]"you are your own sight"
[02:08][01:18]I want to be the minority
[02:12][01:21]I don't need your authority
[02:15][01:25]Down with the moral majority
[02:18][01:28]`cause I want to be the minority
[02:27]
[02:31]BEYOND再见理想
