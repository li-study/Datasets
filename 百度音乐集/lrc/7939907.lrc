[00:39.49]There was no one that you wanted more
[00:48.71]Don't go you know you will break my heart
[00:56.44]She won't love you like I will
[01:03.65]I'm the one who'll stay
[01:07.50]When she walks away
[01:11.43]And you know I'll be standing here still
[03:43.81][02:23.13][01:19.54]I'll be waiting for you

[04:00.98][02:39.64][01:35.53]You will see I can give you
[04:05.57][02:44.08][01:40.22]Everything you need
[04:08.86][02:47.70][01:43.46]Let me be the one to love you more
[01:52.56]See me as if you never knew

[03:31.68][02:11.72]I will make you see
[03:35.98][02:15.36]All the things that your heart needs to know
[02:56.56]And some way all the love that we had can be saved
[03:05.29]Whatever it takes we'll find a way
