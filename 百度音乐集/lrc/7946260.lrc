[00:06.88]Three is a magic number,
[00:10.81]Yes it is, it's a magic number.
[00:14.97]Somewhere in the ancient, mystic trinity
[00:18.58]You get three as a magic number.
[00:24.27]The past and the present and the future.
[00:26.67]Faith and Hope and Charity,
[00:28.97]The heart and the brain and the body,
[00:31.05]Give you three as a magic number.
[00:35.43]It takes three legs to make a tripod
[00:37.83]Or to make a table stand.
[00:39.69]It takes three wheels to make a vehicle
[00:42.42]Called a tricycle.
[00:44.28]Various Artists
[00:45.70]Every triangle has three corners,
[00:47.02]Every triangle has three sides,
[00:48.76]No more, no less.
[00:49.65]You don't have to guess.
[00:52.16]When it's three, you can see
[00:54.67]It's a magic number.
[00:57.74]A man and a woman had a little baby,
[01:01.89]Yes, they did.
[01:04.95]They had three in the family,
[01:09.43]And that's a magic number.
[01:12.83]3-6-9, 12-15-18, 21-24-27, 30.
[01:23.33]3-6-9, 12-15-18, 21-24-27, 30.
[01:32.08]Now the Multiples of 3
[01:42.91]come up three times in each set of 10.
[01:43.92]3 x 10 is 30, 3 x 9 is 27, 3 x 8 is 24, 3 x 7 is 21,
[01:52.02]3 x 6 is 18, 3 x 5 is 15, 3 x 4 is 12,
[01:58.58]And 3 x 3 is 9, and 3 x 2 is 6,
[02:01.98]And 3 x 1 is 3 of course.
[02:05.69]Now dig the pattern once more:
[02:07.88]3-6-9

[02:56.38]A man and a woman had a little baby,
[02:59.67]They had three in the family,
[03:04.82]That's a magic number.
