[00:02.00]Crazy In Love
[00:04.19]Eminem
[00:05.19]
[00:06.69]You always thought that I was doing alright
[00:09.34]But nothing that was through a night
[00:12.17]But I’m crazy over you
[00:15.27]Crazy Over you
[00:17.80]Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu
[00:23.69]Can't you see what you do to me baby?
[00:25.43]You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
[00:29.81]I’m like a lunatic, you make me sick
[00:31.65]You truly are the only one who can do this to me
[00:34.24]You just make me get so crazy.
[00:35.75]I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
[00:38.80]One minute I want to slit your throat
[00:40.47]The next I want sex.
[00:41.77]You make me crazy,
[00:42.59]the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac
[00:44.94]We fuck like 2 jackrabbits
[00:46.36]And maybe that’s a bad habit.
[00:47.80]Cuz the next day we’re right back at it
[00:49.58]In the same exact pattern
[00:51.00]What the fuck is the matter with us
[00:52.42]We can’t figure out if it’s
[00:53.87]Lust or it’s love
[00:55.04]What’s sad is what’s attracting us to each other
[00:56.86]They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
[01:00.04]Which would explain why you’re such a motherfucking bitch
[01:02.31]But I stay and still stick it out
[01:03.88]with you even though I just hit you today
[01:06.11]But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
[01:09.00]Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.
[01:12.06]But if there’s one thing about you I admire its, baby,
[01:14.97]Because you stay with me, maybe, because you’re as crazy as I am
[01:18.10]Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
[01:21.01]But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.
[01:24.03]Like a devil in disguise,
[01:25.50]You’re always full of surprises
[01:26.96]Always pullin’ devises
[01:28.46]Out your personal vibrators and dildos
[01:30.87]You fucked yourself so much
[01:32.13]You barely feel those anymore
[01:33.50]You’re only 24 but you’re plenty more now.
[01:35.85]Sure than those other little hoes
[01:37.70]Who just act like little girls
[01:39.20]Like they’re in middle school still
[01:40.61]You’re crazy sexy cool, chillin
[01:42.31]You play your position
[01:43.36]You never step out of line
[01:44.84]Even though I stay in your business
[01:46.41]You’ve always kept out of mine.
[01:47.97]I wonder whats on your mind
[01:49.37]Sometimes they say love is blind
[01:50.86]Maybe that’s why the first time I dotted your eye
[01:53.15]You ain’t see a sign.
[01:54.48]Or maybe you did Maybe you like me and stuff
[01:57.32]Maybe cuz we’re crazy in loooove
[02:00.40]Crazy Over you
[02:03.32]Crazy Over you
[02:05.84]Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu
[02:12.10]You’re the ink to my paper
[02:13.24]Where my pen is to my pad
[02:14.79]The moral, the very fiber
[02:16.21]The whole substance to my rap.
[02:17.77]You are my reason for being
[02:19.32]The meaning of my existence
[02:20.80]If it wasn’t for you
[02:21.83]I would never be able to spit this
[02:23.84]These sentences I do wit me I am me
[02:25.56]Is you rely on me as much
[02:27.37]as I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
[02:29.86]You provide me the lighterfluid to fuel my fire
[02:32.67]You’re my entire supply
[02:34.10]Gas, the match, the igniter.
[02:35.80]The only way that I am able to stay so stable
[02:38.03]Is you’re the legs to my table
[02:39.55]If you were to break I’d fall on my face.
[02:41.71]But I’m always going to make you feel
[02:43.30]I don’t need you as much as I really need you
[02:45.43]So you don’t use it to your advantage.
[02:47.67]But you’re essential to me
[02:48.97]You’re the air I breathe
[02:50.01]I believe if you ever leave me
[02:51.44]I’d probably have no reason to be.
[02:53.62]You are the Kim to my Marshall
[02:55.05]You’re the Slim to my Shady
[02:56.30]The Dre to my Eminem
[02:57.89]The Alaina to my Hailey.
[02:59.60]You are the word I am looking for when
[03:01.40]I’m trying to describe how I feel inside
[03:03.27]And the right one just won’t come to my mind.
[03:05.58]You’re like the pillar that props me up
[03:07.48]The beam that supports me
[03:08.56]The bitch who never took half,
[03:10.00]The wife who never divorced me.
[03:11.51]You’re like the root to my evil
[03:12.95]You let my devil come out me
[03:14.59]You let me beat the shit out you
[03:16.08]Before you beat the shit out me.
[03:17.82]And no matter how much
[03:19.24]Too much is never enough
[03:21.01]Maybe cuz we’re crazy in loooove
[03:23.95]I’m Crazy Over you
[03:26.92]Crazy Over you
[03:29.48]Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu
