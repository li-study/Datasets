[00:00.00]Fireflight - Stay Close
[00:07.49]
[00:09.49]I want to know you
[00:11.58]There's so much at stake
[00:14.78]Can't face the memories
[00:16.82]They bend me till I break
[00:20.01]Hiding from the past
[00:22.00]But it's eating me alive
[00:25.38]Can't block it out
[00:27.06]When it's coming from inside
[00:31.87]Every turn leads me to a new dead end
[00:37.68]Lost again, I'm screaming your name
[00:42.25]Come close, come close
[00:44.91]And call my name
[00:47.53]How can you turn your back on me
[00:50.23]When you know my pain
[00:52.85]Stay close, stay close
[00:55.48]Light up the night
[00:58.38]Save me from the part of me
[01:00.74]That's begging to die
[01:04.47]
[01:08.16]Precious denial, a stone to break my back
[01:13.38]The chains I carry won't cut me any slack
[01:18.74]Imprisoned by fear with no room for my heart
[01:24.06]My only hope, only you can heal the scars
[01:30.52]Every turn leads me to a new dead end
[01:36.33]Lost again, I'm screaming your name
[01:40.92]Come close, come close
[01:43.49]And call my name
[01:46.19]How can you turn your back on me
[01:48.88]When you know my pain
[01:51.91]Stay close, stay close
[01:54.14]Light up the night
[01:57.02]Save me from the part of me
[01:59.40]That's begging to die
[02:05.10]
[02:08.39]Stay by my side
[02:11.09]If you leave me I will die
[02:13.78]Stay by my side
[02:16.41]If you leave me I will die
[02:19.12]Stay by my side
[02:21.88]If you hold me I will fly
[02:24.50]If you hold me I will fly
[02:27.16]Will you hold me
[02:51.57][02:30.02]Come close, come close
[02:54.08][02:32.88]And call my name
[02:56.87][02:35.53]How can you turn your back on me
[02:59.59][02:38.32]When you know my pain
[03:02.13][02:40.81]Stay close, stay close
[03:04.76][02:43.40]Light up the night
[03:07.65][02:46.35]Save me from the part of me
[03:10.07][02:48.76]That's begging to die
[03:15.78]
