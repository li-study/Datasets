[00:27.40]I feel so unsure
[00:33.20]As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[00:40.15]As the music dies, Something in your eyes,
[00:46.00]Calls to mind a silver screen And all it's sad good-bye
[00:53.17]I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[00:59.08]Though it's easy to pretend,
[01:00.06]I know you're not a fool
[01:03.40]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[01:06.97]And waste the chance that I've been given
[01:10.54]So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
[01:29.31]Time can never mend The careless whisper of a good friend
[01:42.63]To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
[01:48.37]There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find
[01:55.65]I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:05.73]Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
[02:07.38]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[02:10.24]And waste the chance that I've been given
[02:14.09]So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
[02:45.98]Tonight the music seem so loud
[02:47.83]I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way
[02:54.44]We hurt each other with the things we want to say
[02:57.58]We could have been so good together
[03:00.79]We could have lived this dance forever
[03:03.95]But now who's gonna dance with me, Please stay
[03:11.36]I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:16.52]Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
[03:21.81]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[03:25.01]And waste the chance that I've been given
[03:28.59]So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
[03:49.66]Now that you're gone now that you're gone
[04:05.81]Was what i did so wrong, so wrong
[04:08.47]That you have to leave me along
