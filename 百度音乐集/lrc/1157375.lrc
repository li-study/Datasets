[00:17.97]When you're out in front
[00:25.11]And your life is unsure
[00:31.53]What have you got going for you
[00:38.41]After every road you turn
[00:43.94]It's magic when you tell me
[00:51.58]And run your fingers through my hair
[00:55.55]
[00:57.89]I don't need your persuasion
[01:05.84]Cos I'm already there
[01:11.00]
[01:15.56]I've just read it through and I said to myself
[01:28.47]That's not really you, I'll keep myself to myself
[01:41.32]It's magic when you tell me
[01:48.82]And write the words I want to see
[01:51.87]
[01:54.56]When I reach the last line,
[02:01.45]It's just empty for me
[02:08.24]I've been learning so long,
[02:14.82]About the things you do
[02:21.66]I've been learning so long
[02:27.07]About you, about you
[02:35.78]Empty pages I've read you all through
[02:48.84]Empty pages filled with spaces all filled in and not filled in
[03:02.20]Empty pages I've read you all through
[03:15.56]Empty pages filled with spaces all filled in and not filled in
