[00:07.62]Mistletoe and holly deck the halls
[00:15.55]But you don't come around and you don't call
[00:23.21]Well it's just like the season to be lonely
[00:30.59]And my heart is beating for you only
[00:37.89]
[00:38.94]Take my heart this Christmas
[00:42.80]And wrap it in a ribbon and a bow
[00:46.67]Yes take my heart this Christmas
[00:50.54]Take it where ever you go
[00:55.43]
[01:02.11]Everybody has someone to hold
[01:09.81]Nestle by the fire in from the cold
[01:17.31]But I don't hear the carols they are singing
[01:24.71]And I've only got one thing good for giving
[01:31.51]
[01:32.57]So take my heart this Christmas
[01:36.76]And wrap it in a ribbon and a bow
[01:40.70]Yes take my heart this Christmas
[01:44.70]Take it where ever you go
[01:47.90]
[01:48.81]All my bells are ringing just for you
[01:56.04]And I got no desire for someone new
[02:02.61]
[02:03.58]So take my heart this Christmas
[02:07.94]And wrap it in a ribbon and a bow
[02:11.74]Yes take my heart this Christmas
[02:15.65]Take it where ever you go
[02:19.51]Take it where ever you go
[02:27.02]
