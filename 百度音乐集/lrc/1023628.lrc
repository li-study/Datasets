[00:03.17]Tamia - Officially Missing You
[00:10.56]
[00:20.40]All I hear is raindrops, falling on the rooftop
[00:27.26]Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go
[00:31.34]'Cause this pain I feel, it won't go away
[00:36.73]And today I'm officially missing you
[00:43.68]
[00:44.46]I thought that from this heartache, I could escape
[00:50.77]But I've fronted long enough to know
[00:55.33]There ain't no way
[00:58.45]And today I'm officially missing you
[01:04.38]
[01:05.08]Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
[01:12.08]Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
[01:17.77]Said it stays on my mind
[01:20.27]And I-I'm officially...
[01:24.68]
[01:25.10]All I do is lay around, two years full of tears
[01:31.14]From looking at your face on the wall
[01:35.48]Just a week ago you were my baby
[01:40.93]Now I don't even know you at all, I don't know you at all
[01:46.90]
[01:47.49]Well, I wish that you would call me right now
[01:52.05]So that I could get through to you somehow
[01:56.82]But I guess it's safe to say, baby, safe to say
[02:03.13]That I-I'm officially missing you
[02:08.96]
[02:11.23]Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
[02:16.75]Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
[02:22.21]Said it stays on my mind
[02:24.29]And I-I'm officially
[02:29.09]
[02:29.69]Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby
[02:34.69]But I see that's something I just can't do
[02:41.16]From the way you would hold me
[02:43.64]To the sweet things you told me
[02:49.19]I just can't find a way to let go of you
[02:53.61]
[02:56.63]Ooh...can't nobody do it like you
[03:02.18]Said every little thing you do, hey, baby
[03:07.53]Said it stays on my mind
