[01:16.43]Forgive me father
[01:19.93]For I have sinned
[01:24.61]Find me guilty of the life I feel within
[01:31.53]
[01:32.30]When I'm branded
[01:36.45]This mark of shame
[01:40.82]So I look down disgraced for saying I know that you must feel

[04:15.99][02:57.45]For I am shadows and will follow you whatever see my way

[03:42.42]I do your time
[03:44.37]I take your fall
[03:46.77]I'm branded guilty for a soul
[03:54.57]
[04:29.14]I am, I am your secrets
[04:35.10]I am, I am your sin
[04:41.30]I am, I am your guilty
[04:47.51]And I, I am the thorn within
[04:58.16]I am the thorn within
