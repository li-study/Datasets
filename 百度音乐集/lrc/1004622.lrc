[00:00.00]Tori Amos - Sleeps with Butterflies
[00:14.79]Airplanes
[00:17.58]Take you away again
[00:21.16]Are you flying
[00:24.32]Above where we live
[00:27.62]Then I look up a glare in my eyes
[00:33.74]Are you having regrets about last night
[00:40.07]I'm not but I like rivers that rush in
[00:49.62]So then I dove in
[00:52.99]Is there trouble ahead
[00:56.15]For you the acrobat
[00:59.44]I won't push you unless you have a net
[01:04.99]
[02:40.48][02:15.09][01:05.32]You say the word
[02:41.60][02:16.22][01:06.11]You know I will find you
[02:43.73][02:18.47][01:08.13]Or if you need some time
[02:45.52][02:19.94][01:09.86]I don't mind
[02:47.14][02:21.76][01:11.74]I don't hold on
[02:24.10][01:14.08]To the tail of your kite
[02:27.43][01:17.49]I'm not like the girls that you've known
[02:30.92][01:20.93]But I believe I'm worth coming home to
[02:34.47][01:24.25]Kiss away night
[02:37.00]This girl,this girl
[01:26.82]This girl only sleeps with butterflies
[01:35.61]With butterflies
[01:41.45]So go on and fly then boy
[01:48.90]
[01:50.80]Balloons
[01:53.19]Look good from on the ground
[01:56.70]I fear with pins and needles around
[02:03.16]We may fall then stumble
[02:06.15]Upon a carousel
[02:09.30]It could take us anywhere
[02:52.98]I'm not like the girls that you've known
[02:56.43]But I believe I'm worth coming home to
[02:59.80]Kiss away night
[03:02.51]This girl only sleeps with butterflies
[03:11.13]With butterflies
[03:17.61]With butterflies
[03:23.47]So go on and fly boy
