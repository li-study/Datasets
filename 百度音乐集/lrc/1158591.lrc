[00:-0.08]
[00:00.00]I'm not afraid of anything
[00:03.85]I just need to know that I can breath
[00:07.85]And I don't need much of anything
[00:11.72]But suddenly suddenly
[00:14.45]
[00:15.93]I am small and the world is big
[00:19.80]All around me is fast moving
[00:24.06]Surrounded by so many things
[00:28.14]Suddenly suddenly
[00:30.66]

[00:58.17]And I am free
[01:00.52]But I get tired and I get weak
[01:04.80]I get lost and I can't sleep
[01:08.60]But suddenly suddenly

[01:43.13]Would you cry with me
[01:48.83]Ah ah ah
[02:06.46]I am small
