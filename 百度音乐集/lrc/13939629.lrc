[00:02.55]Take Me Away
[00:05.76]Avril Lavigne
[00:08.72]
[00:12.55]I cannot find a way
[00:15.79]To describe it
[00:17.27]It's there
[00:18.21]Inside
[00:19.64]All I do is hide
[00:22.05]I wish
[00:23.19]That it
[00:24.35]Would just go away
[00:26.76]What would
[00:27.90]You do?
[00:29.09]You do?
[00:30.09]If you knew...
[00:32.19]What would you do?
[00:35.13]
[00:35.42]All the pain
[00:36.56]I thought I knew
[00:37.71]All these thoughts lead back to you
[00:40.26]Back to what
[00:41.38]Was never said
[00:42.86]Back and forth
[00:43.99]Inside my head
[00:46.04]I can't handle this confusion
[00:50.87]I'm unable
[00:53.36]Come and take me away
[00:56.73]
[01:00.88]I feel
[01:02.01]Like I
[01:03.90]Am alone
[01:05.54]All by
[01:06.68]Myself
[01:07.91]I need to get around this
[01:10.34]My words
[01:11.46]Are cold
[01:12.76]I don't want them to hurt you
[01:15.22]If I
[01:16.16]Show you
[01:17.28]I don't think you'd understand
[01:19.71]Cause no one understsands
[01:23.18]
[01:23.80]All the pain
[01:24.91]I thought I knew
[01:26.21]All these thoughts lead back to you
[01:28.50]Back to what
[01:29.75]Was never said
[01:31.10]Back and forth
[01:32.13]Inside my head
[01:34.16]I can't handle this confusion
[01:38.91]I'm unable
[01:41.37]Come and take me away
[01:46.17]
[01:46.60]I'm going nowhere
[01:48.43]Off and on and...
[01:51.50]I'm getting nowhere
[01:53.36]Off and on and...
[01:54.88]Take me away
[01:56.60]I'm going nowhere
[01:58.03]Off and on and...
[02:00.57]Off and on and
[02:03.49]Off and on
[02:04.41]
[02:04.95]All the pain
[02:06.13]I thought I knew
[02:07.44]All these thoughts lead back to you
[02:09.68]Back to what
[02:10.93]Was never said
[02:12.25]Back and forth
[02:13.30]Inside my head
[02:15.27]I can't handle this confusion
[02:20.02]I'm unable
[02:22.45]Come and take me away
[02:28.62]Take me away
