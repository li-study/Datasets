[00:04.71]All And Everyone
[00:05.14]PJ Harvey
[00:05.75]
[00:46.90]Death was everywhere,
[00:51.29]in the air and in the sounds
[00:55.43]coming off the mounds of Bolton's Ridge.
[01:00.75]Death's anchorage.
[01:04.16]When you rolled a smoke or told a joke,
[01:08.60]it was in the laughter and drinking water
[01:13.62]It approached the beach
[01:15.17]as strings of cutters,
[01:17.32]Dropped into the sea and lay around us.
[01:22.40]Death was in the ancient fortress,
[01:26.24]shelled by a million bullets
[01:28.76]from gunners, waiting in the copses
[01:34.27]with hearts that threatened to pop their boxes,
[01:38.44]as we advanced into the sun
[01:43.78]death was all and everyone.
[01:48.09]death was all and everyone.
[01:56.37]As we, advancing in the sun
[02:11.70]As we, advancing every man
[02:24.27]As we, advancing in the sun
[02:34.44]
[02:35.83]Death hung in the smoke and clung
[02:40.48]to 400 acres of useless beachfront.
[02:45.82]A bank of red earth, dripping down death
[02:50.11]now, and now, and now
[02:53.31]Death was everywhere,
[02:57.85]in the air and in the sounds
[03:01.99]coming off the mounds of Bolton's Ridge.
[03:08.25]Death's anchorage.
[03:10.70]Death was in the staring sun,
[03:14.96]fixing its eyes on everyone.
[03:19.13]It rattled the bones of the Light Horsemen
[03:23.53]still lying out there in the open
[03:28.57]As we, advancing in the sun
[03:42.88]As we, advancing every man
[03:55.58]As we, advancing in the sun
[04:08.10]Sing Death to all and everyone.
