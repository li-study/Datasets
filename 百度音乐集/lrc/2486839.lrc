[00:09.12]The Breakthrough
[00:09.86]
[00:11.24]Is it getting better
[00:16.38]Or do you feel the same
[00:21.84]Will it make it easier on you now
[00:26.64]You got someone to blame
[00:30.26]You say...
[00:32.21]One love
[00:34.93]One life
[00:37.60]When it's one need
[00:40.00]In the night
[00:42.22]One love
[00:44.69]We get to share it
[00:47.00]Leaves you darling if you
[00:49.60]Don't care for it
[01:03.50]Did I disappoint you
[01:08.17]Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
[01:13.19]You act like you never had love
[01:18.52]And you want me to go without
[01:22.00]Well it's...
[01:23.48]Too late
[01:26.06]Tonight
[01:28.44]To drag the past out into the light
[01:33.37]We're one, but we're not the same
[01:37.69]We get to
[01:38.82]Carry each other
[01:40.34]Carry each other
[01:42.80]One...
[02:05.03]Have you come here for forgiveness
[02:09.57]Have you come to raise the dead
[02:14.84]Have you come here to play Jesus
[02:20.27]To the lepers in your head
[02:24.29]Did I ask too much
[02:27.80]More than a lot
[02:30.19]You gave me nothing
[02:32.01]Now it's all I got
[02:35.25]We're one
[02:37.27]But we're not the same
[02:39.68]Well we
[02:40.82]Hurt each other
[02:42.42]Then we do it again
[02:44.54]You say
[02:45.96]Love is a temple
[02:47.52]Love a higher law
[02:50.31]Love is a temple
[02:52.59]Love the higher law
[02:55.54]You ask me to enter
[02:57.34]But then you make me crawl
[03:00.53]And I can't be holding on
[03:04.56]To what you got
[03:06.06]When all you got is hurt
[03:09.53]One love
[03:12.11]One blood
[03:14.47]One life
[03:15.80]You got to do what you should
[03:19.57]One life
[03:21.68]With each other
[03:24.44]Sisters and my brothers
[03:29.88]One life
[03:31.55]But we're not the same
[03:33.85]We get to
[03:34.93]Carry each other
[03:36.72]Carry each other
[03:39.26]One...life
