[00:13.79]And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
[00:24.38]I see us inside of each other
[00:33.73]I feel my unconscious merge with yours
[00:38.94]And I hear a voice say
[00:42.27]"What's his is hers"
[00:46.19]I'm falling into you
[00:51.42]This dream could come true
[00:56.36]And it feels so good falling into you
[01:06.32]I was afraid to let you in here
[01:15.92]Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
[01:25.78]The walls begin to tumble down
[01:31.07]And I can't even see the ground
[01:38.18]I'm falling into you
[01:43.65]This dream could come true
[01:48.08]And it feels so good falling into you
[01:57.33]Falling like a leaf
[02:01.81]Falling like a star
[02:07.93]Finding a belief
[02:13.19]Falling where you are
[02:19.57]Catch me, don't let me drop!
[02:24.97]Love me, don't ever stop!
[02:41.44]
[02:47.84]So close your eyes and let me kiss you
[02:57.63]And while you sleep I will miss you
[03:07.68]I'm falling into you
[03:13.00]This dream could come true
[03:17.47]And it feels so good falling into you
[03:26.62]Falling like a leaf
[03:31.29]Falling like a star
[03:37.85]Finding a belief
[03:42.72]Falling where you are
[03:51.74]Falling into you
[03:56.08]Falling into you
[04:01.10]Falling into you
