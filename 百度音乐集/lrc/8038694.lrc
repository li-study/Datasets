[00:01.12]Baby, behave, we'll make it work ~~~
[00:09.15]Are you with me? ~~
[00:16.42]You're not golden
[00:18.17]And I'm getting tired
[00:20.13]Act like you own the place
[00:21.69]When really you've only just arrived
[00:23.83]I caught first glimmers
[00:25.33]In hides and skins
[00:27.47]Look who's all grown up
[00:28.81]Black swanning about the solar winds
[00:31.27]
[00:31.70]You're gonna lose it all
[00:32.95]And find yourself on your knees
[00:35.06]So, get a grip and you might
[00:36.53]Flow, reverse the great, slow bleed
[00:39.11]I've tried patience, but
[00:40.56]You always want a war
[00:42.33]This house won't tolerate any more
[00:45.29]Stop this right away
[00:47.40]
[00:49.18]Put that down and clean this mess up
[00:52.94]End of conversation
[00:56.27]Put your back in it and
[00:58.04]Make it up to me now
[01:00.25]
[01:01.96]The cold shoulder
[01:02.97]Folded arms and looking up
[01:05.05]You've never listened
[01:06.86]And carry on careless, regardless
[01:09.25]This is not a fire drill and
[01:10.92]If we hold any hope
[01:12.33]It's harmonic connection
[01:14.35]And stereos in biosis
[01:16.39]
[01:18.36]Choking out mine now
[01:20.19]You're everywhere, everywhere
[01:22.27]Multiplying around me, child
[01:25.35]
[01:25.72]A strain on my heart
[01:27.43]This rock can't tolerate any more
[01:30.49]Stop this right away
[01:33.63]
[01:34.28]Put that down and clean this mess up
[01:38.36]End of conversation
[01:41.81]Put your back in it and

[02:25.96]You're only what you give back
[02:27.51]You're only what you give back
[02:29.47]You're only what you give back
[02:30.92]Back
[02:31.51]Stop this right away
