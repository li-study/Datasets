[00:00.00]Third Eye Blind - Bonfire
[00:05.00]
[00:14.95]A little early in spring, a bonfire ring
[00:17.78]She's shivering alone
[00:20.30]I bumped into you somehow
[00:23.84]But you can wear
[00:25.21]
[00:25.76]My duct-taped vest
[00:27.09]It's a party best
[00:28.53]It's really all I own
[00:31.52]Everything's changing now
[00:33.35]
[00:36.58]And I am high like a star that's flying
[00:39.60]Cassiopeia
[00:42.22]Everything's changing now
[00:44.54]
[00:45.16]She said it's alright
[00:48.18]She said no don't die alone
[00:51.23]There's no goodbyes
[00:53.82]
[00:56.86]Lightning comes and lightning goes
[00:59.19]And it's all the same to me
[01:01.75]Let it in
[01:02.77]Cuz I want you so
[01:05.19]I can hardly breathe or release
[01:08.21]Into one thousand pieces
[01:10.39]I have broke into
[01:12.47]Over you
[01:13.62]The chain will soon be gone,
[01:15.95]I keep burning on and on and on
[01:19.13]
[01:19.74]If nothing else I am myself
[01:22.30]That's all I have to give
[01:25.28]Everything's changing now
[01:27.15]
[01:30.45]Oh we could live like kings
[01:32.47]If we take a risk
[01:33.72]Or we could live in doubt
[01:36.26]Everything's changing now
[01:38.05]Oh now
[01:38.55]Come on, come on
[01:40.38]And lightning comes and lightning goes
[01:42.47]And it's all the same to me
[01:44.71]Let it in
[01:46.17]Cuz I want you so
[01:48.31]I can hardly breathe or release
[01:50.98]Into one thousand pieces
[01:53.57]I have broke into
[01:55.56]Over you
[01:56.95]The chain will soon be gone,
[01:58.99]And I keep burning on and on
[02:02.21]This, this is, this is the last time,
[02:07.57]This, this is, this is your goodbye
[02:12.77]This, this is, this is the last time
[02:18.42]This, this is, this is your goodbye
[02:23.52]
[02:29.90]Some girls will break you down
[02:32.16]Just to see you come undone
[02:35.55]Everything's changing now
[02:37.38]
[02:40.62]Maybe you and I are cursed
[02:43.20]Maybe you and I are one
[02:46.13]And that's the universe
[02:48.02]Around, around she drags you
[02:50.29]Lightning comes and lightning goes
[02:52.90]It's all the same to me
[02:54.92]Let it in
[02:56.16]Cuz I want you so
[02:58.13]I can hardly breathe or release
[03:01.54]Into one thousand pieces
[03:03.81]I have broke into
[03:05.71]Over you
[03:07.04]We'll stop the flames at dawn,
[03:09.18]I keep burning on and on and on
[03:11.55]I really love you!
[03:12.77]
[03:15.87]Did you get what you wanted?
[03:21.16]Did you get what you wanted?
[03:26.51]Did you get what you wanted?
[03:30.12]
