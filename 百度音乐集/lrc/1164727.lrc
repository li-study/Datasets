[00:05.81]Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb
[00:12.50][00:44.32][03:45.49]
[00:55.17]I'm 'round the corner from anything that's real
[01:00.58]I'm across the road from hope
[01:05.85]I'm under a bridge in a rip tide
[01:10.09]That's taken everything I call my own
[01:15.80][01:20.87][01:47.84][01:52.99][01:58.46][02:52.42][02:57.58][03:02.99][03:13.62][03:18.94][03:24.34]One step closer to knowing
[01:27.37]I'm on an island at a busy intersection
[01:32.79]I can't go forward, I can't turn back
[01:38.07]Can't see the future
[01:40.75]It's getting away from me
[01:43.28]I just watch the tail lights glowing
[02:03.42]Knowing, knowing
[02:31.77]I'm hanging out to dry
[02:34.45]With my old clothes
[02:37.36]Finger still red with the prick of an old rose
[02:42.56]Well the heart that hurts
[02:45.05]Is a heart that beats
[02:47.74]Can you hear the drummer slowing?
[03:07.72]To knowing
[03:29.14]To knowing, to knowing
[03:33.47][03:36.69]
