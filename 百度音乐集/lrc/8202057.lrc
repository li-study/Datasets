
[00:11.00]There's every good reason
[00:16.00]For letting you go
[00:20.00]She's sneaky and smoked out
[00:24.00]And it's starting to show
[00:28.00]I never let you go
[00:32.00]I never let you go
[00:37.00]I never let you go
[00:41.00]I never let you...
[00:42.00]Turn around your back on each other
[00:46.00]That's a good idea
[00:48.00]Break a promise to your mother
[00:50.00]Turn around your back on each other
[01:02.00]You said that I changed
[01:06.00]Well maybe I did
[01:10.00]But even if I changed
[01:14.00]What's wrong with it?
[01:19.00]I never let you go
[01:23.00]I never let you go
[01:27.00]I never let you go
[01:31.00]I never let you...
[01:32.00]Turn around your back on each other
[01:36.00]That's a good idea
[01:38.00]Break a promise to your mother
[01:41.00]Turn around your back on each other
[01:53.00]And all our friends are gone, are gone
[01:57.00]And all the time moves on and on
[02:02.00]And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
[02:06.00]And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
[02:13.00]If there's a reason
[02:17.00]It's lost on me
[02:22.00]Maybe we'll be friends
[02:26.00]I guess we'll see
[02:30.00]I never let you go
[02:34.00]I never let you go
[02:38.00]I never let you go
[02:43.00]I never let you go
[02:44.00]Turn around your back on each other
[02:47.00]That's a good idea
[02:49.00]Break a promise to your mother
[02:52.00]Turn around
[02:54.00]Let's turn on each other
[02:56.00]Good idea, break a promise to your mother
[03:01.00]Turn around your back on each other
[03:04.00]That's a good idea
[03:06.00]Break a promise to your mother
[03:09.00]Turn around your back on each other
[03:13.00]What a good idea
[03:25.00]I remember the stupid things
[03:27.00]The mood rings, the bracelets and the beads
[03:30.00]The nickels and dimes, yours and mine
[03:32.00]Did you cash in all your dreams?
[03:33.00]You don't dream for me, no
[03:36.00]You don't dream for me, no
[03:38.00]But I still feel you pulsing like sonar
[03:40.00]From the days in the waves
[03:42.00]That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save
[03:45.00]That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save
[03:45.00]That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save
[03:48.00]She's like a sunburn
[03:50.00]She's like a sunburn
