[00:07.46]生命不止 希望不灭
[00:08.20]
[00:11.00]I never meant to be so bad to you
[00:15.79]One thing I said that I would never do
[00:20.55]One look from you and I would fall from grace
[00:25.29]And that would wipe this smile right from my face
[00:31.12]
[00:32.32]Do you remember when we used to dance
[00:36.57]And incidence arose from circumstance
[00:41.25]One thing lead to another we were young
[00:46.02]And we would scream together the songs unsung
[00:50.68]
[00:51.72]It was the heat of the moment
[00:55.67]telling me what your heart meant
[00:59.16]Heat of the moment shone in your eyes
[01:06.32]
[01:06.80]And now you find yourself in 82
[01:11.14]The disco hotspots hold no charm for you
[01:15.56]You can't cincern yourself with bigger things
[01:20.20]You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings
[01:22.20]
[01:25.42]it was heat of the moment
[01:29.70]heat of the moment
[01:33.22]heat of the moment shone in your eyes
[01:44.26]
[02:10.95]And when your looks are gone and you're alone
[02:15.23]How many night's you sit beside the phone
[02:19.71]What were the things you wanted for yourself
[02:24.15]Teenage ambition you remember well
[02:25.15]
[02:29.49]It was the heat of the moment
[02:33.63]telling me what your heart meant
[02:36.78]Heat of the moment shone in your eyes
[02:43.49]It was the heat of the moment
[02:46.92]heat of the moment
[03:10.94]Heat of the moment shone in your eyes
