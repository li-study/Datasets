[00:04.39]Gonna stay in bed today
[00:08.28]\'Cause I can\'t stand the light
[00:10.76]Don\'t know why I get so down
[00:17.60]I won\'t be much fun tonight
[00:22.05]And I can\'t believe you still wanna hang around me
[00:30.99]It\'s not so pretty all the time
[00:35.47]You don\'t mind
[00:38.71]To you it\'s alright
[00:43.89]As I am is how you take me
[00:49.32]Never try to push or make me different
[00:53.91]When I talk you listen to me
[00:57.50]As I am is how you want me and
[01:02.96]I know I\'ve found the pieces missing
[01:08.86]I\'m looking at him

[01:29.84]Don\'t know a lot of things
[01:33.67]But I know what I got
[01:36.15]It\'s not so perfect everyday
[01:40.56]I don\'t have to try
[01:43.03]Cause it all falls into place
[01:48.99]As I am is how you take me
[01:53.51]Never try to push make me different
[01:58.86]When I talk you listen to me
[02:01.77]As I am is how you want me and
