[00:18.56]I see so little time
[00:20.05]My eyes are crossed, my hands are tied
[00:23.64]All I wanna do is that great thing
[00:30.31]I never see a passer-by
[00:33.40]My skin is cold, it's turned to ice
[00:35.91]And everything I do, I want leaving me
[00:44.27]And I guess it's a might
[00:53.12]With a light that you fight
[00:59.57]You turn a blind eye
[01:05.67]To the world in the sky
[01:16.50]I didn't know in your lies
[01:29.74]Above your head you hold so high
[01:33.26]All my energy is behind it
[01:39.79]A dream for the passers-by
[01:43.11]My eyes are wasted here tonight
[01:46.75]I never tried to get across the feeling
[01:56.89]And I guess it's a might
[02:01.83]With a light that you fight
[02:09.66]You turn a blind eye
[02:15.18]To the world in the sky
