[00:22.06]As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
[00:26.05]The light behind your face helps me realise
[01:28.06][00:35.37]Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
[01:31.78][00:39.14]Maybe the next time I’ll be yours and maybe you’ll be mine
[02:23.56][00:46.23]I don’t know if it’s even in your mind at all
[02:29.01][00:52.32]It could be me
[02:49.56][02:31.47][00:54.64]At this moment in time
[02:51.36][02:33.49][00:56.93]Is it in your mind at all
[02:55.55][02:37.96][01:01.15]It should be me, it could be me
[02:59.45][02:42.52][01:05.95]Forever
[01:15.42]Wandering through life will love come home to you
[01:18.87]And the love you want forever, will they be true to you
[01:39.04]I don’t know if it’s even in your mind at all
[01:45.20]It could be me
[01:47.16]At this moment in time
[01:49.32]Love’s indescribable
[01:53.80]It should be me, it could be me
[02:07.69][01:58.72]Forever
[01:59.77]Easy, ready, willing, over time
[02:03.54]Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
[02:08.52]You’ve got the body now you want my soul
[02:12.50]Don’t even think about it say no go
