[00:29.09]I have a very good friend
[00:32.47]The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
[00:36.66]She has a personal style
[00:40.42]Some people like it, others tend to go wild
[00:44.66]You hear her voice everywhere
[00:48.36]Taking the chair
[00:49.92]She's a leading lady
[00:53.92]And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
[00:57.05]Head over heels
[00:58.95]Breaking her way
[01:01.07]Pushing through unknown jungles every day
[01:05.33]She's a girl with a taste for the world
[01:10.98](The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
[01:13.66]Head over heels
[01:14.78]Setting the pace
[01:16.72]Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
[01:21.14]She's extreme, if you know what I mean
[01:32.11]Her man is one I admire
[01:35.73]He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
[01:40.01]Each time when he speaks his mind
[01:43.55]She pats his head and says, That's all very fine
[01:47.75]Exert that will of your own
[01:51.36]When you're alone
[01:53.01]Now we'd better hurry
[01:57.10]And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
[02:00.33]Head over heels
[02:01.12]Breaking her way
[02:04.17]Pushing through unknown jungles every day
[02:08.46]She's a girl with a taste for the world
[02:13.10](The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
[02:16.22]Head over heels
[02:17.89]Setting the pace
[02:19.84]Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
[02:24.24]She's extreme, if you know what I mean
[02:47.28]You hear her voice everywhere
[02:50.62]Taking the chair
[02:52.40]She's a leading lady
[02:56.22]And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
[02:58.80]Head over heels
[02:59.87]Breaking her way
[03:03.76]Pushing through unknown jungles every day
[03:07.76]She's a girl with a taste for the world
[03:12.16](The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
[03:15.30]Head over heels
[03:17.00]Setting the pace
[03:19.11]Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
[03:23.53]She's extreme, if you know what I mean
[03:28.41](She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)
[03:31.18]And she goes
[03:34.76]Head over heels
