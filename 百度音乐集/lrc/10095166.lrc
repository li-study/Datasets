[00:00.43]Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me
[00:02.37](Original Vocal: John Elton)
[00:03.37]David Archuleta
[00:04.28]
[00:05.43]I can't light
[00:09.99]no more of your darkness
[00:19.46]All my pictures
[00:23.07]seem to fade to black and white
[00:33.02]But you misread
[00:37.44]my meaning when I met you
[00:47.48]Closed the door
[00:51.47]and left me blinded by the light
[01:00.97]Don't let the sun go down on me
[01:07.56]Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
[01:14.49]I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free oh
[01:27.37]But losing everything is like the sun going down
[01:35.02]sun going down
[01:38.62]sun going down on me
[01:42.79]Don't let the sun go down on me
[01:49.10]Oh on me
