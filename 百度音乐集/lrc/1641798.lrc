[00:23.53]There’s a thousand words that I could say
[00:28.85]To make you come home (yeah)
[00:32.64]Seems so long ago you walked away
[00:36.87]And left me alone
[00:41.15]And I remember what you said to me
[00:45.14]You were acting so strange
[00:49.62]And maybe I was too blind to see
[00:53.29]That you needed a change
[00:55.99]
[00:56.83]Was it something I said, to make you turn away
[01:00.88]To make you walk out and leave me cold
[01:03.96](Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh)
[01:05.24]If I could just find a way
[01:07.51]To make it so that you were right here
[01:15.19]right now
[01:15.85]
[01:16.22]Chorus:
[01:16.50]I’ve been sittin here
[01:17.95]Can’t get you off mind
[01:19.80]I try my best to be a man and be strong
[01:23.95]I drove myself insane
[01:25.98]Wishing I could touch your face (touch your face)
[01:28.62]But the truth remains you’re gone
[01:33.31](you’re) Gone
[01:35.43](baby you’re) Gone
[01:36.56](girl you’re gone. Baby girl you’re)
[01:37.55]Gone
[01:39.49](you’re) Gone

[01:41.76]
[01:50.68]Now I don’t wanna make excuses baby
[01:54.78]Won’t change the fact that your gone (no, no)
[01:58.75]But if there’s something that I could do
[02:03.80]Won’t you please let me know
[02:07.20]The time is passing so slowly now
[02:11.41]Guess, that’s my life without you
[02:13.55](Guess, that’s my life without you)
[02:15.69]And maybe I could change my every day
[02:19.99]But baby I don’t want to
[02:22.14]
[02:22.80]I’ll just hang around and find some things to do
[02:27.31]To take my mind off missing you (take my mind off missing you)
[02:31.71]And I know in my heart you can’t say that you don’t love me too
[02:37.80]Please say you do

[02:46.52]I try my best to be a man and be strong
[02:49.26](my best to be a man and be strong)
[02:50.36]I drove myself insane
[02:52.27]Wishing I could touch your face
[02:55.82](Wishing I could touch your face)
[02:56.78]But the truth remains
