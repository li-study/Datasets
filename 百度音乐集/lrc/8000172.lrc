[00:02.23]I Will Follow You Into The Dark

[00:24.63]Love of mine some day you will die
[00:30.41]But I'll be close behind
[00:33.40]I'll follow you into the dark
[00:37.43]No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
[00:42.94]Just our hands clasped so tight
[00:46.31]Waiting for the hint of a spark
[00:50.03]If heaven and hell decide
[00:52.56]That they both are satisfied
[00:56.12]Illuminate the NOs on their vacancy signs
[01:02.20]If there's no one beside you
[01:05.18]When your soul embarks
[01:08.49]Then I'll follow you into the dark
[01:12.37]
[01:14.36]In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
[01:20.25]I got my knuckles brusied by a lady in black
[01:27.15]And I held my tongue as she told me
[01:31.80]Son fear is the heart of love
[01:36.13]So I never went back
[01:39.57]If heaven and hell decide
[01:42.24]That they both are satisfied
[01:45.85]Illuminate the NOs on their vacancy signs
[01:51.98]If there's no one beside you
[01:54.93]When your soul embarks
[01:58.14]Then I'll follow you into the dark
[02:01.86]
[02:04.33]You and me have seen everything to see
[02:09.72]From Bangkok to Calgary
[02:13.14]And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
[02:19.21]The time for sleep is now
[02:22.19]It's nothing to cry about
[02:25.63]Cause we'll hold each other soon
[02:28.77]The blackest of rooms
[02:36.29]If heaven and hell decide
[02:39.38]That they both are satisfied
[02:42.99]Illuminate the NOs on their vacancy signs
[02:49.10]If there's no one beside you
[02:51.98]When your soul embarks
[02:55.24]Then I'll follow you into the dark
[02:58.84]
[03:00.70]Then I'll follow you into the dark
[03:05.45]
