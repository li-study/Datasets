[00:04.89]The Last High
[00:06.81]the dandy warhols
[00:09.91]
[00:21.15]I am alone
[00:23.08]But adored by 100,000 more
[00:28.75]Then I said when you were the last.
[00:34.79]I have known love, like a whore
[00:38.86]from at least 10,000 more
[00:42.62]Then I swore when you were the last
[00:48.66]When you were the last high
[00:53.55]hi-i-i-gh
[00:57.53]hi-i-i-gh
[01:00.69]hi-i-i-gh
[01:06.39]You were awake,
[01:08.41]I should have stayed, but wandered.
[01:13.66]I was only out for a day.
[01:16.55]out for a day.
[01:22.48]It was Chicago for a moment,
[01:26.98]And then it was   Paris and London    for a few
[01:35.30]days.
[01:37.03]
[01:38.27]Well, I am alone
[01:40.15]But adored by 100,000 more
[01:46.26]Then I swore when you were the last.
[01:52.17]When you were the last high
[01:57.32]hi-i-i-gh
[02:00.90]hi-i-i-gh
[02:04.02]hi-i-i-gh
[02:08.05]you were the last high
[02:12.78]hi-i-i-gh
[02:16.81]hi-i-i-gh
[02:19.78]hi-i-i-gh
[02:23.69]
[02:41.76]I was the first to have spoken
[02:46.19]And I said...just about...all of the things...you shouldn't say.
[02:57.31]So maybe you loved me, but now    maybe you don't.
[03:04.38]And maybe you'll call me.
[03:09.31]Maybe you won't.
[03:12.29]
[03:13.30]So, I am alone
[03:15.41]But adored by 100,000 more
[03:21.35]Then I said when you were the last.
[03:27.16]I have known love, like a whore
[03:31.10]from at least 10,000 more
[03:35.11]Then I swore when you were the last.
[03:41.03]When you were the last high
[03:45.91]hi-i-i-gh
[03:49.89]hi-i-i-gh
[03:52.93]hi-i-i-gh
[03:57.20]you were the last high
[04:01.81]hi-i-i-gh
[04:05.70]hi-i-i-gh
[04:08.77]hi-i-i-gh
