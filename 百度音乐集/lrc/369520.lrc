[00:-0.44]Arcade Fire - Modern Man

[00:00.71]
[00:14.01]So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
[00:19.28]And the people behind me, they can't understand
[00:23.00]Makes me feel like
[00:26.72]Makes me feel like
[00:28.69]
[00:30.66]So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
[00:35.32]And the people behind me, they can't understand
[00:39.71]Makes me feel like
[00:43.10]Something don't feel right
[00:45.64]
[00:56.34]Like a record that's skipping
[00:58.53]I'm a modern man
[01:00.93]And the clock keeps ticking
[01:02.79]I'm a modern man
[01:05.30]Makes me feel like
[01:09.15]Makes me feel like
[01:11.03]
[01:12.14]In my dream I was almost there
[01:15.12]And you pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
[01:19.27]They say we are the chosen few
[01:22.91]But we're wasted
[01:25.27]And that's why we're still waiting
[01:29.51]On a number from the modern man
[01:33.91]Maybe when you're older you will understand
[01:37.46]Why you don't feel right
[01:40.89]Why you can't sleep at night now
[01:43.58]
[02:01.18]In line for a number but you don't understand
[02:06.50]Like a modern man
[02:09.16]In line for a number but you don't understand
[02:14.21]Like a modern man
[02:16.98]
[02:17.62]Oh I had a dream I was dreaming
[02:21.85]And I feel I'm losing the feeling
[02:26.27]Makes me feel like
[02:29.44]Like something don't feel right
[02:33.94]I erase the number of the modern man
[02:38.48]Want to break the mirror of the modern man
[02:43.00]Makes me feel like
[02:46.84]Makes me feel like
[02:49.09]
[02:49.84]In my dream I was almost there
[02:52.86]But you pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
[02:56.67]I know we are the chosen few
[03:00.46]But we're wasted
[03:02.86]And that's why we're still waiting
[03:06.41]In line for a number but you don't understand
[03:11.07]Like a modern man
[03:13.44]In line for a number but you don't understand
[03:18.64]Like a modern man
[03:21.41]
[03:21.62]And you feel so right
[03:25.37]But how come you can't sleep at night?
[03:28.81]In line for a number but you don't understand
[03:34.10]Like a modern man
[03:36.83]
[03:39.26]I'm a modern man
[03:43.64]I'm a modern man
[03:47.13]I'm a modern man
[03:50.55]I'm a modern man
