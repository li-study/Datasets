[00:00.02]little green apples-Egil Olsen/bobby russell
[00:00.28]
[00:01.00]and i wake up in the morning
[00:03.90]with my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
[00:11.65]and i stumble to the breakfast table
[00:14.59]while she is goin off to school goodbye
[00:23.21]and she reaches out and takes my hand
[00:26.52]squeezes it and says how you feelin hon?
[00:34.46]and i look across at smiling lips that warm my heart
[00:38.59]and see my morning sun
[00:42.90]
[00:44.40]and if that's not lovin me then all Iâ€™ve got to say
[00:55.90]
[00:58.03]god didn't make little green apples
[01:00.65]and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summertime
[01:08.84]there's no such thing as dr. zeuss disneyland
[01:12.84]and mother goose is no nursery rhyme
[01:20.15]god didn't make little green apples
[01:23.21]and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summertime
[01:31.34]and when myself is feelin low
[01:34.52]i think about her face aglow and ease my mind
[01:41.59]
[01:43.83]sometimes I call her up at home even though I know that she's busy
[01:50.65]and I ask her if she could get away and meet me
[01:54.83]and maybe we could grab a bite to eat.
[01:59.71]and then she drops what she's doin
[02:03.21]and then she hurries down to meet me but i'm always late
[02:09.33]but she sits waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
[02:15.15]because she's made that way
[02:20.02]
[02:20.15]and if that's not lovin me then all i've got to say
[02:30.77]
[02:33.27]god didn't make little green apples
[02:35.96]and it don't snow in mineapolis when the winter comes
[02:43.96]there's no such thing as make-believe puppy dogs
[02:48.34]and autumn leaves or no bb guns
[02:55.46]god didn't make little green apples
[02:58.52]and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summertime
[03:06.65]and when myself is feelin low
[03:09.46]i think about her face aglow and ease my mind
