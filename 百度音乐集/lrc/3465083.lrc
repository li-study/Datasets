[00:04.73]Keren Ann
[00:06.73]
[00:09.18]Over and over you wanted it so fast
[00:13.19]Head on my shoulder I'll pour myselfa glass
[00:17.14]Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
[00:21.16]Then make a sad face and tell me it's to late
[00:25.21]Right now and right here
[00:28.87]My love oh my dear
[00:32.91]I'll try to be clear
[00:36.95]My love oh my dear
[00:40.91]Over and over you wanted me to play
[00:44.84]Head on my shoulder there's nothing left to say
[00:48.92]Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
[00:52.88]Then we can jump and pretend we disagree
[00:56.90]Right now and right here
[01:00.76]My love oh my dear
[01:04.90]I'll try to be clear
[01:09.11]Over and over we're turning off the light
[01:12.88]Even the warriors are always great at night
[01:16.86]Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
[01:20.98]Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon
[01:25.12]Right now and right here
[01:28.91]My love oh my dear
[01:35.19]
[01:48.05]Faces under water , look much closer
[01:59.26]When they appear
[02:04.21]Your hand on my shoulder
[02:11.60]We'll be older in a year
[02:20.38]In the morning after should I laugh or disappear
