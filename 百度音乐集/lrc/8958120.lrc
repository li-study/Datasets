[00:09.57]
[00:12.61]I'm not a teacher, nor a preacher
[00:17.51]I think I'm street wise
[00:20.40]But I trip all the time
[00:24.61]My lips are too small and you're too tall
[00:29.50]Hard for me to stroke your hair
[00:32.84]and do clear the air
[00:35.58]
[00:36.42]I wanna feel we're the same under the skin
[00:39.42]How can I be a queen without the King?
[00:42.58]It's never easy to form a ring
[00:48.45]I'd do anything to be your battery
[00:51.45]I can be anything to make you happy
[00:56.10]I swear to God
[01:00.31]
[03:27.60][01:00.59]I was there when your heart was broken
[03:33.65][01:06.64]I was there when you blamed yourself
[03:39.62][01:12.68]I was there when you were giving up
[03:44.15][01:17.09]Wish I'd had a word to extend
[01:24.04]
[01:36.65]We live in a zoo, woodering who trusts who
[01:41.57]Yes, sometimes they are flaky
[01:44.92]and too greedy
[01:48.65]I'm not a vower, but trying to be a wildflower
[01:53.55]supposed to keep your peace of mind
[01:56.94]but to leave you behind
[02:00.04]
[02:00.43]I wanna feel we're the same as peas in a pod
[02:03.42]For me to stay away from you is odd
[02:06.69]I see a long path we've trod
[02:12.50]I'd do anything if you want me to
[02:15.46]You're the rain to make me bloom
[02:20.03]So you're allowed to cry
[02:24.41]
[02:24.66]I was there when your heart was broken
[02:30.68]I was there when you were under clouds
[02:36.67]I was there when you were raving at the world
[02:41.59]I was there for you
[02:46.45]
[02:47.37]I've been watching you become tougher
[02:51.20]Now the rainy season is over
[02:54.48]I'm scared, to tell the truth
[02:56.73]Cause you're so free to fly away
[03:01.66]
[03:03.59]I was there when your heart was broken
[03:09.66]I was there when you were looking down
[03:15.69]I was there when you lost your way
[03:20.17]Wish I'd had a word to extend
[03:26.73]Did you know?
