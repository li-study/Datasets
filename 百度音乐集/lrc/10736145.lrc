[00:03.01]All At Once
[00:08.01]Whitney Houston
[00:13.01]
[00:23.01]All at once
[00:27.14]I finally took a moment and
[00:30.22]I'm realizing that
[00:34.23]Your not coming back
[00:38.13]And it finally hit me all at once
[00:44.30]All at once
[00:48.63]I started counting teardrops and
[00:51.90]At least a million fell
[00:55.74]My eyes began to swell
[00:59.36]And all my dreams were shattered
[01:02.13]All at once
[01:04.99]
[01:05.47]Ever since I met you
[01:08.49]You're the only love I've known
[01:12.16]And I can't forget you
[01:15.49]Though I must face it all alone
[01:20.77]All at once
[01:22.72]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[01:27.10]Wishing you'd come back to me
[01:31.04]And that's all that matters now
[01:35.03]All at once
[01:37.23]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[01:41.22]Holding on to memories
[01:45.38]And it hurts me more than you know
[01:49.71]So much more than it shows
[01:53.10]All at once
[01:55.95]
[01:58.74]All at once
[02:02.84]I looked around and found
[02:05.08]That you were with another love
[02:09.85]In someone else's arms
[02:13.40]And all my dreams were shattered
[02:16.26]All at once
[02:19.98]All at once
[02:24.24]The smile that used to greet me
[02:27.58]brightened someone else's day
[02:31.30]She took your smile away
[02:34.92]And left me with just memories
[02:38.03]All at once
[02:41.31]Ever since I met you
[02:44.01]You're the only love I've known
[02:48.43]And I can't forget you
[02:51.01]Though I must face it all alone
[02:56.21]All at once
[02:58.58]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[03:02.23]Wishing you'd come back to me
[03:06.29]And that's all that matters now
[03:10.44]All at once
[03:13.05]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[03:16.57]Holding on to memories
[03:20.79]And it hurts me more than you know
[03:25.33]So much more than it shows
[03:28.40]All at once
[03:32.94]All at once
[03:34.52]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[03:39.01]Wishing you'd come back to me
[03:43.61]And the hurt is morn than you know
[03:47.52]So much more than it shows
[03:50.87]All at onces
[04:01.05]And that's all that matters now
[04:04.74]All at once
[04:07.43]I'm drifting on a lonely sea
[04:11.85]Wishing you'd come back to me
[04:15.16]And it hurts me more than you know
[04:19.53]All at onces
