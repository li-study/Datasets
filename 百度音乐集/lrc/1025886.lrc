[00:08.19]Lyric：Carole King
[00:16.65]Music：Howard Greenfield
[00:31.90]I'll never let you see
[00:36.43]The way my broken heart is hurting me
[00:41.25]I've got my pride and I know how to hide
[00:45.05]All my sorrow and pain
[00:48.55]I'll do my crying in the rain
[00:52.08]
[00:56.31]If I wait for cloudy skies
[01:00.55]You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
[01:05.30]You'll never know that I still love you so
[01:09.53]Though the heartaches remain
[01:12.95]I'll do my crying in the rain
[01:16.69]
[02:20.04][01:20.61]Raindrops falling from heaven
[02:23.90][01:24.52]Will never wash away my misery
[02:28.84][01:29.52]But since we're not together
[02:31.21][01:31.87]I'll wait for stormy weather
[02:33.61][01:34.23]To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
[02:37.20][01:38.85]
[02:39.34][01:40.03]Someday when my crying's done
[02:43.96][01:44.52]I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
[02:48.48][01:49.13]I maybe a fool,but till then, darling you
[02:52.73][01:53.29]Will never see me complain
[02:56.13][01:56.76]I'll do my crying in the rain
[03:00.15][02:00.48]
[03:12.22][03:04.40]Crying in the rain
[03:15.72][03:07.54]
