[01:05.43]
[01:07.43]When you're stoned, baby, I am drunk
[01:15.35]We make love seems a little dazzler
[01:23.45]It's hard sometimes not to look away
[01:29.56]And think what's the point
[01:31.49]when I'm having to hold this fine time
[01:37.57]I think I'll explode if I can't feel this free now
[01:43.42]
[01:47.02]If you won't let me fall for you
[01:53.84]Then you won't see the best things
[01:58.95]I would love to do for you
[02:02.57]Instead you will be missing me when I go
[02:10.11]As I want to hang it out in your coat
[02:16.36]
[02:22.30]I feel love baby, joy in the road
[02:30.37]And the world moves with me
[02:38.39]I feel love start just slip away silently
[02:46.56]Quietly take the things and go
[02:52.49]And think what's the point,
[02:54.67]think where's the hope when coming home
[02:58.67]
[03:02.00]If you won't let me fall for you
[03:08.86]Then you won't see the best things
[03:13.84]I would love to do for you
[03:17.53]Instead you will be missing me when I go
[03:24.98]As I want to hang it out in your coat
[03:31.04]
[03:35.12]And if you find one day,
[03:39.17]find some freedom merrily
[03:43.11]With this freedom maybe,
[03:47.31]maybe you will find some peace
[03:51.36]With this peace baby,
[03:55.26]I hope it brings you back to me
[03:59.40]Bring you home, take me home
[04:03.27]
[04:06.63]If you won't let me fall for you
[04:13.58]Then you won't see the best things
[04:18.63]I would love to do for you
[04:22.05]Instead you will be missing me when I go
[04:29.82]As I want to hang it out in your coat
[04:35.77]
[04:38.69]Oh, take me home
[04:46.70]Oh, take me home
[04:54.11]When you're stoned, baby, take me home
[05:02.84]Oh...
[05:07.37]
