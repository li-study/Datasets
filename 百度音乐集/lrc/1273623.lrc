[00:01.76]演唱   Sum 41
[00:03.97]专辑   Underclass Hero
[00:05.47]
[00:09.48]As time passes by, direction unknown
[00:15.06]You\'ve left us now but we\'re not alone
[00:20.13]Before you know it your cups overflown
[00:25.15]You measured no one that I\'ve ever known
[00:28.77]
[00:29.59]And it\'s quite alright
[00:34.05]And goodbye for now
[00:39.38]Just look up to the stars
[00:41.96]And believe who you are
[00:44.45]Cause it\'s quite alright
[00:49.45]And so long, goodbye
[00:54.01]
[01:03.00]We always knew that it\'d come to this
[01:08.00]It\'s times like this I forget what I miss
[01:12.91]Matters of heart are hard to address
[01:18.11]Especially when yours is full of emptiness
[01:20.81]
[01:21.96]And it\'s quite alright
[01:26.61]And goodbye for now
[01:31.68]Just look up to the stars
[01:34.00]And believe who you are
[01:36.48]Cause it\'s quite alright
[01:41.65]And so long, goodbye
[01:47.54]
[02:11.79]As time passes by, direction unknown
[02:17.58]You\'ve left us now but we\'re not alone
[02:22.60]Before you know it your cups overflown
[02:27.52]You measured no one that I\'ve ever known
[02:31.68]
[02:32.08]And it\'s quite alright
[02:36.57]And goodbye for now
[02:41.38]Just look up to the stars
[02:43.86]And believe who you are
[02:46.30]Cause it\'s quite alright
[02:51.10]And so long, goodbye.
[02:55.56]
[02:57.58]End...
