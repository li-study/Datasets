[00:35.64]Jenny, i have this perfect dream
[00:44.60]we are close and there is nothing in between
[00:51.18]your eyes are deep like the sea
[01:00.97]but warm like the sun
[01:08.59]
[01:10.30]jenny, you wake up in my arms
[01:18.36]i hold you close and keep you safe from any harm
[01:27.53]and like a warm summer breeze

[01:40.98]
[01:52.18]we feel the ground beneath our feet
[02:00.83]when we embrace we are complete
[02:09.03]we see the colors and the beauty of this place
[02:14.89]as we reach from the earth to the sky, so high...
[02:29.57]
[02:45.04]jenny, you are my perfect love
[02:53.27]sent so clearly from the heavens up above

[03:26.06]and my most precious melodies
