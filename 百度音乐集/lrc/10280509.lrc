[00:00.00]Days Of Wine And Roses
[00:10.02]- Matt Monro
[00:20.95]
[00:22.41]The days of wine and roses
[00:34.17]Laugh and run away
[00:39.87]Just like a child at play
[00:45.87]Through a meadow land
[00:51.39]toward a closing door
[00:56.43]A door marked 'nevermore'
[01:02.25]That wasn't there before
[01:07.04]
[01:10.54]The lonely night discloses
[01:21.30]Just a passing breeze
[01:26.82]Filled with memories
[01:32.99]Of the golden smile
[01:37.06]that introduced me to
[01:44.89]The days of wine and roses
[01:51.45]And you
[01:54.19](------ Misic ------)
[02:02.40]The lonely night discloses
[02:13.35]Just a passing breeze
[02:18.57]Filled with memories
[02:24.69]Of the golden smile
[02:29.62]that introduced me to
[02:37.47]The days of wine and roses
[02:47.60]And you
