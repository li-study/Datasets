[00:07.31]Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
[00:31.65]When you feel it in your body
[00:33.72]You found somebody who makes you change your ways
[00:37.30]Like hanging with your crew
[00:39.16]Said you act like you\'re ready
[00:41.17]But you don\'t really know
[00:42.94]And everything in your past - you wanna let it go
[00:46.50]I\'ve been there, done it, fucked around
[00:49.87]After all that - this is what I found
[00:54.02]Nobody wants to be alone
[00:57.75]If you\'re touched by the words in this song
[01:00.80]Then baby...
[01:01.56]U got, u got it bad
[01:03.64]When you\'re on the phone
[01:05.88]Hang up and you call right back
[01:09.64]U got, u got it bad
[01:11.85]If you miss a day without your friend
[01:15.04]Your whole life\'s off track
[01:17.29]You know you got it bad when you\'re stuck in the house
[01:20.72]You don\'t wanna have fun
[01:22.68]It\'s all you think about
[01:25.54]U got it bad when you\'re out with someone
[01:28.44]But you keep on thinkin\' bout somebody else
[01:32.70]U got it bad
[01:33.61]When you say that you love \'em
[01:35.41]And you really know
[01:36.72]Everything that used to matter, don\'t matter no more
[01:39.63]Like my money, all my cars
[01:42.73](You can have it all back)
[01:44.31]Flowers, cards and candy
[01:46.44](I do it just cause I\'m...)
