[00:10.50]Owl City
[00:15.50]
[00:25.56]Shipwreck in the sea of faces,
[00:27.93]There's a dreamy world up there,
[00:31.02]Dear friends in higher places,
[00:33.72]Carry me away from here,
[00:36.56]Travel light let the sun eclipse you,
[00:39.18]'Cause your flight is about to leave,
[00:41.99]And there's more to this brave adventure,
[00:44.67]Than you'd ever believe,
[00:47.53]Birdseye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you,
[00:53.43]Wide eyes will always brighten the blue,
[00:58.18]Chase your dreams, and remember me, speak bravery,
[01:03.66]Because after all those wings will take you, up so high,
[01:09.04]So bid the forest a fond goodbye, as you brace the wind and,
[01:13.70]Take to the sky,
[01:18.89]Take to the sky,
[01:21.94]
[01:26.06]On the hills of lore and wonder,
[01:28.66]There's a stormy world up there,
[01:31.36]You can't whisper above the thunder,
[01:33.67]
[01:34.08]But you can fly anywhere,
[01:36.99]Purple burst of paper birds this,
[01:39.71]Picture paints a thousand words,
[01:42.36]So take a breath of mist and mystery,
[01:45.44]And don't look back!
[01:47.89]Birdseye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you,
[01:53.77]Wide eyes will always brighten the blue,
[01:58.55]Chase your dreams, and remember me, speak bravery,
[02:04.91]Because after all those wings will take you, up so high,
[02:09.28]So bid the forest a fond goodbye, as you brace the wind and,
[02:13.85]Take to the sky,...Take to the sky,...
[02:22.19]
[02:26.92]There's a realm above the trees,
[02:29.79]Where the lost are finally found,
[02:31.86]Touch your feathers to the breeze,
[02:35.34]And leave the ground,
[02:37.46]Birdseye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you,
[02:42.86]Wide eyes will always brighten the blue,
[02:47.59]Chase your dreams, and remember me, speak bravery,
[02:53.03]Because after all those wings will take you, up so high,
[02:58.45]So bid the forest a fond goodbye, as you brace the wind and,
[03:03.01]Take to the sky,...
[03:08.52]U take to the sky,U take to the sky,
[03:16.34]
[03:24.91]U take to the sky,
[03:27.28]
