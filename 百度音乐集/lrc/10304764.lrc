[00:25.00]Fifteen minutes left to throw me together
[00:29.00]For mister right now, not mister forever

[00:57.00]for the rest of my life
[01:00.00]Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
[01:03.50]Just enough ain't enough this time

[01:52.00]for the rest of my life
[01:55.00]Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
