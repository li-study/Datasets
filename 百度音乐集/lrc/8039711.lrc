[00:18.12]Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
[00:21.63]Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
[00:26.64]Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?
[00:33.47]I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
[00:37.40]Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
[00:41.82]Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words
[00:48.32]We live on front porches and swing life away,
[00:52.88]We get by just fine here on minimum wage
[00:57.07]If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
[01:00.85]I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
[01:06.13]I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
[01:09.72]The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
[01:14.63]Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow
[01:21.61]I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
[01:25.31]But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
[01:29.35]We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go
[01:37.92]We live on front porches and swing life away,
[01:41.51]We get by just fine here on minimum wage
[01:46.00]If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
[01:49.39]I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand....until you hold my hand
[02:20.34]I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
[02:24.19]Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
[02:29.12]Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words
[02:37.24]We live on front porches and swing life away,
[02:41.20]We get by just fine here on minimum wage
[02:45.09]If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
[02:48.98]I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
[02:55.22]Swing life away
