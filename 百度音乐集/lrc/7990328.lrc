[00:35]Life is a waterfall
[00:39]we're one in the river
[00:40]and one again after the fall
[00:48]swimming through the void
[00:49]we hear the word
[00:51]we lose ourselves
[00:52]but we find it all....
[01:00]cause we are the ones that want to play
[01:03]always want to go
[01:04]but you never want to stay
[01:12]and we are the ones that want to choose
[01:15]always want to play
[01:16]but you never want to lose
