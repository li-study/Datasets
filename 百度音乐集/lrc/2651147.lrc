[00:07.00]Who has in him the silence of the sea,
[00:09.00]the noise of the earth and
[00:11.00]the music of the air......
[00:12.00]
[00:14.52]There's a place where lovers go
[00:19.81]To cry their troubles away
[00:26.03]And they call it Lonesome Town
[00:33.30]Where the broken hearts stay
[00:38.13]You can buy a dream or two,
[00:44.41]To last you all through the years
[00:50.44]And the only price you pay
[00:57.16]Is a heart full of tears
[01:01.12][Full of tears]
[01:02.34]
[01:03.34]Goin' down to lonesome town,
[01:09.05]Where the broken hearts stay,
[01:15.52]Goin' down to lonesome town
[01:20.17]To cry my troubles away.
[01:27.98]
[01:28.92]In the town of broken dreams,
[01:33.53]The streets are filled with regret,
[01:40.82]Maybe down in lonesome town,
[01:46.57]I can learn to forget.
[01:49.91][To forget]
[01:50.51]
[01:52.46]Maybe down in lonesome town,
[01:58.43]I can learn to forget
