[00:16.45]just a reflection
[00:17.85]just a glimpse
[00:18.88]just a little reminder
[00:23.04]of all the what abouts
[00:25.90]and all the might have
[00:26.18]could have beens
[00:28.69]another day
[00:29.92]some other way
[00:31.49]but not another reason to continue
[00:36.79]and now you're one of us
[00:39.61]the wretched
[00:43.09]the hopes and prays
[00:46.35]the better days
[00:49.70]the far aways
[00:53.40]forget it
[00:55.46]it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
[00:58.53]it didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
[01:01.98]it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
[01:05.41]it didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
[01:09.03]now you know
[01:14.08]this is what it feels like
[01:22.79]now you know
[01:27.93]this is what it feels like
[01:48.73]the clouds will part and the sky cracks open
[01:51.92]and god himself will reach his fucking arm

[01:57.86]just to push you down
[01:58.99]just to hold you down
[02:02.13]stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
[02:05.24]and it's hard to believe it could come down to this
[02:08.63]back at the beginning
[02:14.11]sinking
[02:14.96]spinning
[02:17.52]and in the end
[02:20.90]we still pretend
[02:24.18]the time we spend
[02:27.47]not knowing when
[02:30.86]you're finally free
[02:34.27]and you could be
[02:36.71]but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
[02:39.72]it didnt turn out quite the way that you wanted it
[02:40.94]
[02:43.30]now you know
[02:48.22]this is what it feels like
[02:56.97]now you know
[03:02.11]this is what if feels like
