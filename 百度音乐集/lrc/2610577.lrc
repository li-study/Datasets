[00:06.60]
[00:08.29]Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:22.89]Two people, just meeting, barely touching each other
[00:33.26]Two spirits, greeting, tryna carry each further
[00:43.22]You are one, and I am another
[00:55.25]We should be, one inside each other
[03:36.87][03:26.91][02:45.91][02:35.33][01:18.45][01:07.80]You can see inside me, will you come inside me

[01:50.52]Two strangers, not strangers
[01:55.94]Only lacking the knowing
[02:00.34]So willing, feeling
[02:07.48]Infinite growing
[02:12.33]While we're here, the whole world is turning
[02:22.10]We should be, one, fulfilling the yearning
[03:48.79]Inside me, inside me
