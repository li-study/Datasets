[00:00.50]Time can never mend
[00:06.21]The careless whisper of a good friend
[00:12.76]To the heart and mind
[00:16.12]Ignorance is king
[00:18.85]There's no comfort in the truth
[00:21.91]Pain is all you'll find
[00:27.20]
[00:50.84]I feel so unsure
[00:57.00]As you take my hand
[00:59.32]and lead me to the dance floor
[01:03.47]As the music dies
[01:06.65]Something in your eyes
[01:09.86]Calls to mind a silver screen
[01:13.15]And you're its sad goodbye
[01:16.67]
[01:17.23]－1 I'm never gonna dance again
[01:19.34]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[01:23.10]Though it's easy to pretend
[01:25.70]I know you're not a fool
[01:28.98]Should have known better that
[01:30.73]to cheat a friend
[01:32.09]And waste the chance that I've been given
[01:35.87]So I'm never gonna dance again
[01:38.48]The way I dance with you, oh
[01:43.71]
[01:54.49]Time can never mend
[02:00.91]The careless whisper of a good friend
[02:07.43]To the heart and mind
[02:10.84]Ignorance is king
[02:13.68]There's no comfort in the truth
[02:16.94]Pain is all you'll find
[02:20.35]
[02:21.05]Repeat 1- I'm never gonna dance again
[02:23.09]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:26.85]Though it's easy to pretend
[02:29.65]know you're not a fool
[02:32.90]Should have known better that to cheat a friend
[02:35.47]And waste the chance that I've been given
[02:39.40]So I'm never gonna dance again
[02:42.55]The way I dance with you, oh
[02:47.37]
[02:54.65]way I dance with you
[03:08.03]oh~~~~
[03:10.96]ight the music seems so loud
[03:14.16]I wish that we could lose this crowd
[03:17.51]Maybe it's better this way
[03:20.64]If we'd hurt each other with the things
[03:22.67]We want to say
[03:23.90]We could have been so good together
[03:27.06]We could have lived this dance forever
[03:30.01]Now who's gonna dance with me
[03:34.99]Please dance
[03:36.86]
[03:37.82]Repeat 1－I'm never gonna dance again
[03:39.90]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:43.88]Though it's easy to pretend
[03:46.28]know you're not a fool
[03:49.49]Should have known better that to cheat a friend
[03:52.50]And waste the chance that I've been given
[03:56.20]So I'm never gonna dance again
[03:59.17]The way I dance with you, oh
[04:06.43]
[04:13.12]The way I dance with you
[04:20.07]Now that you're gone
