[00:03.00]John Legend - Another Again
[00:04.30]
[00:13.03]So we did it again
[00:14.78]Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again
[00:18.71]Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again
[00:24.58]It's so dramatic again
[00:26.39]After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again
[00:30.37]Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite again
[00:35.61]I'm wasting time
[00:37.68]I can't help it she's so fine
[00:40.63]Oh I like her style
[00:43.59]And I love the way she talks and I smile
[00:47.86]As much as we may try
[00:50.76]Can't quite see eye to eye
[00:54.90]So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye
[00:58.28]
[00:59.63](And again and again and again)
[01:00.86]Oh, and then, we do it again
[01:07.11]We do it again and we do it again
[01:12.35]Oh, and then, we do it again
[01:18.76]We want it again, and we want it again
[01:21.64]
[01:23.26]So we fake it again
[01:25.00]I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
[01:26.82]But she's naked again
[01:28.66]We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
[01:34.49]I can't invite her again
[01:36.37]'Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
[01:38.34]And I'll fight her again
[01:40.18]So it's over, but I told her to come over again
[01:45.76]I'm wasting time
[01:47.62]But she's always on my mind
[01:50.60]I can't let her go
[01:53.57]Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know
[01:58.12]As much as we may try
[02:01.24]Can't quite see eye to eye
[02:05.24]So in the meantime I guess we say bye-bye
[02:09.32]
[02:09.97](And again and again and again)
[02:11.13]Oh, and then, we do it again
[02:17.46]We do it again and we do it again
[02:22.90]Oh, and then, we do it again
[02:29.39]We want it again, and we want it again
[02:38.00]
[02:56.13]So I've got a new friend
[02:57.93]I wish I could forget you
[02:59.56]But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
[03:02.30]She's like you, but she's not you, gotta find you again
[03:07.22]
[03:08.37]So we remember again
[03:10.18]The middle of December and I took you out to dinner again
[03:14.14]Oh I love her, it's not over, just another again
[03:19.15]
[03:20.14](And again and again and again)
[03:21.20]Oh,another again
[03:27.50]I love her, it's another again…
[03:31.75](And again and again and again)
[03:33.42]Oh,another again
[03:41.09]It's another again…
