[00:16.28]Down here the river meets the sea
[00:23.85]In the sticky heat I feel ya' open up to me
[00:38.55]Love comes out of nowhere baby, like a hurricane
[00:51.88]And it feels like rain
[00:59.38]And it feels like rain
[01:04.11]Lying underneath the stars lying next to you
[01:18.59]I'm wondering who you are
[01:28.59]How do you do?
[01:36.62]The clouds blow in across the moon
[01:44.21]The wind howls out your name
[01:48.53]Feels like rain
[01:53.33]Feels like rain
[02:29.83]We ain't never gonna make that bridge tonight
[02:37.85]Across lake Ponchartrain
[02:43.58]And it feels like rain
[02:46.66]
[02:50.46]And it feels like rain
[02:59.88]Batten down the hatches, Baby
[03:03.96]But keep your heart out on your sleeve
[03:08.94]It looks like we're in for stormy weather, that's no cause for us to leave
[03:24.83]Just lie here in my arms
[03:32.38]Let it wash away the pain
[03:38.45]Feels like rain
[03:43.01]
[03:45.60]Feels like rain
[03:50.41]
[03:52.51]Can you feel it?
[04:19.71]Let your love flow....
[04:32.73]
[04:33.63]Feels like rain
