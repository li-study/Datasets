[00:01.10]6.Prayer Of The Refugee
[00:02.78]
[00:07.31]Warm yourself by the fire, son,
[00:09.17]And the morning will come soon.
[00:12.91]I'll tell you stories of a better time,
[00:15.44]In a place that we once knew.
[00:16.41]
[00:19.34]Before we packed our bags
[00:21.15]And left all this behind us in the dust,
[00:25.38]We had a place that we could call home,
[00:28.11]And a life no one could touch.
[00:29.10]
[00:30.15]Don't hold me up now,
[00:32.16]I can stand my own ground,
[00:34.65]I don't need your help now,
[00:37.33]You will let me down, down, down!
[00:39.70]
[00:40.47]Don't hold me up now,
[00:41.78]I can stand my own ground,
[00:44.50]I don't need your help now,
[00:47.58]You will let me down, down, down!
[00:48.90]
[00:49.67]Down!
[00:51.85]
[00:59.16]We are the angry and the desperate,
[01:02.56]The hungry, and the cold,
[01:05.59]We are the ones that kept quiet,
[01:08.25]And always did what we were told.
[01:11.76]
[01:12.63]But we've been sweating while you slept so calm,
[01:14.68]In the safety of your home.
[01:18.09]We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
[01:21.87]Everything you've known.
[01:22.79]
[01:23.14]Don't hold me up now,
[01:23.46]I can stand my own ground,
[01:27.34]I don't need your help now,
[01:32.30]You will let me down, down, down!
[01:33.28]
[01:34.26]Don't hold me up now,
[01:35.02]I can stand my own ground,
[01:37.34]I don't need your help now,
[01:39.84]You will let me down, down, down!
[01:43.26]
[01:43.51]So open your eyes child,
[01:44.65]Let's be on our way.
[01:50.82]Broken windows and ashes
[01:52.06]Are guiding the way.
[01:53.40]
[01:54.42]Keep quiet no longer,
[01:56.95]We'll sing through the day,
[01:58.58]Of the lives that we've lost,
[02:02.26]And the lives we've reclaimed.
[02:04.16]
[02:33.80]Don't hold me up now,
[02:35.79]I can stand my own ground,
[02:38.17]I don't need your help now,
[02:40.53]You will let me down, down, down!
[02:42.67]
[02:43.55]Don't hold me up now,
[02:45.21]I can stand my own ground,
[02:47.61]I don't need your help now,
[02:50.71]You will let me down, down, down!
[02:52.22]
[02:53.27]Don't hold me up?
[02:55.54](I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
[02:57.37]Don't hold me up?
[03:00.70](I don't need your help)
[03:02.31]No! No! No!
[03:03.64]Don't hold me up!
[03:05.75](I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
[03:07.52]Don't hold me up!
[03:10.41](I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
[03:12.92]Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
[03:16.80]
