[00:35.98]
[00:37.98]I'll never cry, I wish to fly
[00:44.90]over the city lines.
[00:48.69]There could be lies, but from your eyes
[00:55.56]I see the truth of life.
[00:59.20]I won't lose anther chance to turn my best side to you
[01:10.31]the moments that we had
[01:14.25]will be in my mind for a life time.
[01:20.09]
[01:20.59]I'll never cry, though I feel tired
[01:27.57]at what I have to do.
[01:31.19]I want to shine, nothing to hide.
[01:38.24]I woke up and realized
[01:42.22]It is burning and rather
[01:44.92]freezing in the night.
[01:47.31]
[01:52.85]It starts the lullabys,
[01:58.08]it starts the lullabys.
[02:02.53]
[02:25.86][02:15.28][02:04.56]When I think of you,
[02:30.91][02:20.23][02:09.52]it seems so beautiful.
[02:34.46]The sky is clean
[02:36.61]and the world is clear
[02:41.96]like a crystal.
[02:45.32]
[03:07.47]I'll try to smile
[03:10.93]when I die.
[03:12.58]I think I'll be strong at that time.
[03:17.97]we will be fine,
[03:21.55]though we are suffering now
[03:24.57]have to walk thousands of miles
[03:29.36]The comet burns at the last moment
[03:35.57]when lies are broken.
[03:39.75]The comet burns at the last moments
[03:46.26]when lives are waven.
[03:49.54]
[04:12.47][04:01.86][03:51.30]When I think of you,
[04:17.58][04:06.88][03:56.21]it seems so beautiful.
[04:21.16]The sky is clean
[04:23.25]and the world is clear
[04:28.54]like a crystal.
[04:32.16]
