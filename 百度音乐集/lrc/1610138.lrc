[00:14.79]I used to be now I'm not what you see, Lord I try
[00:21.58]And now it seems all those dreams have come true
[00:24.24]but they're passing me by
[00:29.33]Some fast talkin' mama for a dollar put a smile on my face
[00:36.17]I'm drivin' all night
[00:38.02]I end up in the same old place
[00:42.70]
[00:43.12]My gypsy road can't take me home
[00:47.07]I drive all night just to see the light
[00:50.29]My gypsy road can't take me home
[00:54.39]I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright
[01:01.75]
[01:05.69]And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
[01:12.21]I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by
[01:19.78]Some fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
[01:26.98]I'm drivin' all night
[01:28.69]Just to keep the rat in the race

[01:41.06]My gypsy road can't take me home
[01:45.14]I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright
[01:55.82]
[01:56.12]Sometimes I feel so old
[02:00.37]Got my lights burnin' bright
[02:01.76]But I'm lookin' pretty sold
[02:03.30]Sometimes I feel so cold
[02:06.41]So cold
[02:10.35]Let's go
[02:14.67]
[02:36.15]Got to get on home

[02:58.65]
[02:59.25]My gypsy road can't take me home
[03:03.00]I drive all night just to see the light
[03:06.54]My gypsy road can't take me home
[03:10.34]I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright
[03:13.47]

[03:17.58]I drive all night just to see the light
[03:20.72]My gypsy road can't take me home
