[00:18.19]Here's another one, yeah
[00:21.56]Feel this right here
[00:26.81]
[00:27.81]It feels like only yesterday
[00:30.60]That you was lying here with me
[00:32.69]I still hear you say, "Oh yea"
[00:35.65]I love the way you say, "Oh yea"
[00:37.48]But now it's just a memory
[00:39.19]And I'm knowing that it was my fault
[00:41.68]By thinking I could brush it off
[00:44.13]You always with me saying, "Oh yea"
[00:46.18]So what it's 5 A.M. I'm checkin' in when I check in
[00:50.04]Baby I was thinking I was so slick
[00:53.50]When I know that I've done you wrong
[00:55.84]But you never know what you've got
[00:59.18]Til what you've got is gone
[01:00.79]
[01:01.79]Gotta try to make it through
[01:05.79]Without you
[01:07.81]And there's nothing I can do
[01:11.64]Come on home baby

[01:33.32]Knowing something wasn't right
[01:35.52]I was saying, "Oh yea"
[01:37.41]I'm sure that all her things were packed
[01:39.41]And it's just too late to get her back
[01:41.48]I didn't even have to read the note
[01:44.67]Just to know that your heart was broke
[01:47.06]I was thinkin' Oh yea
[01:48.51]You had more than you can stand
[01:51.06]I should have been a better man
[01:52.94]Baby I was thinkin' I was so slick
[01:56.16]Girl I was doin' you so wrong
[01:58.58]You never know what you've got
[02:02.04]Til what you've got is gone

[02:32.34]Should've put you number one
[02:35.48]But I've been playing myself
[02:37.84]Cause I know now that you're all I want
[02:41.47]But if you give me one more chance
