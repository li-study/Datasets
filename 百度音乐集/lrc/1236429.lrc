[01:03.68]Fade out the candlelight
[01:07.67]Look at the shadows on the walls
[01:11.32]Just follow your heart
[01:14.39]You've waited long enough
[01:19.29]Don't turn me down and say you won't
[01:23.61]Cause then you'd lie to me
[01:26.85]And no, you cannot lie to me
[01:30.83]I would see
[01:32.63]
[01:35.59]And now I know it is time to possess your mind, whole
[01:42.19]And now I know it is time to give away what I saved
[01:49.76]
[02:05.63]I've got the feeling that it will be this time
[02:09.21]I've got the feeling that it won't be right, won't be wrong
[02:13.00]I've got the feeling you're arousing my senses
[02:17.01]I've got the feeling that I have to feel, have to feel
[02:21.03]I've got the feeling that it will be this time
[02:24.87]I've got the feeling that it won't be right, won't be wrong
[02:28.53]I've got the feeling you're arousing my senses
[02:32.69]I've got the feeling that I have to feel, have to feel
[02:37.31]And now I know it is time to possess your mind, whole
[02:45.32]And now I know it is time to give away what I saved
[02:51.65]
[03:04.93]And you will take me, high, so high
[03:12.58]And you will take me, high, so high
[03:20.59]And you will take me, high, so high
[03:28.25]And you will take me, high, so high
[03:35.53]
[03:37.49]So high
[03:41.28]So high
[03:45.31]So high
[03:49.18]So high
[03:53.60]High
