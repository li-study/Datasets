[00:27]See the stone set in your eyes
[00:32]See the thorn twist in your side
[00:36]I wait for you
[00:44]Sleight of hand and twist of fate
[00:49]On a bed of nails she makes me wait
[00:53]And I wait without you
[01:00]With or without you
[01:04]With or without you
[01:08]
[01:11]Through the storm we reach the shore
[01:15]You give it all but I want more
[01:19]And I'm waiting for you
[01:26]With or without you
[01:30]With or without you
[01:34]I can't live
[01:39]With or without you
[01:48]
[01:53]And you give yourself away
[01:57]And you give yourself away
[02:01]And you give
[02:03]And you give
[02:05]And you give yourself away
[02:12]My hands are tied
[02:13]My body bruised, she's got me with
[02:20]Nothing to win and
[02:23]Nothing left to lose
[02:27]
[02:28]And you give yourself away
[02:32]And you give yourself away
[02:36]And you give
[02:38]And you give
[02:41]And you give yourself away
[02:45]With or without you
[02:49]With or without you
[02:53]I can't live
[02:58]With or without you
[03:04]
[03:20]With or without you
[03:24]With or without you
[03:28]I can't live
[03:33]With or without you
[03:37]With or without you
