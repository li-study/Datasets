[00:00.00]Last Unicorn
[00:00.34]Groove Coverage
[00:01.00]
[00:03.67]When the last eagle flies 
[00:06.82]over the last crumbling mountain
[00:10.57]And the last lion roars 
[00:13.92]at the last dusty fountain
[00:17.48]In the shadow of the forest 
[00:20.79]though she may be all and one
[00:24.23]They would stare unbelieving  
[00:27.71]at the last unicorn
[00:31.40]
[02:15.38]When the first breath of winter 
[02:19.07]though their flowers itâ€™s icing
[02:22.53]And you look to the north   
[02:25.98]and the pale moon is rising
[02:29.41]And it seems like all is dying   
[02:32.85]and would leave the world to more
[02:36.15]In the distance hear the laughter 
[02:39.57]of the last unicorn
[02:43.45]
