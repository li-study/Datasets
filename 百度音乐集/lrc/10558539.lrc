[ti:Christmas Day]
[00:-1.-79]The young gentleman came riding past

[00:13.11]on a snow-blue winter\'s day
[00:20.03]He asked to drink by our fire and
[00:25.14]I was pleased to let him stay
[00:29.86]He drank there quietly for a while
[00:34.58]and then he turned and said to me
[00:38.49]Your eyes are green
[00:41.21]Like summer grass
[00:45.33]Your lips are red
[00:52.04]like a fresh-cut rose
[00:59.76]Your hair is soft
[01:03.07]like an Irish stream
[01:08.19]And your voice is filled with sweet beauty
[01:13.31]And the last words I heard him say were
[01:18.42]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[01:23.54]And the night will come but I won\'t sleep
[01:28.66]as I watch the stars that lead him
[01:33.77]I cannot place where he is
[01:38.89]but still my heart goes with him
[01:44.00]I\'m saving all my Sunday clothes for the day
[01:49.12]that I\'ll be leaving
[01:54.24]Father knows
[01:59.35]My sister knows
[02:04.47]And my friends
[02:09.59]They\'re happy for me
[02:14.70]And the priest he says
[02:19.82]you should thank God
[02:24.93]for the blessing of such beauty
[02:30.05]And the last words I heard him say were
[02:35.17]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[02:40.28]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[02:45.40]On Christmas Day
[02:50.52]I shall return for you
[02:55.63]My love...
[03:00.75]And the last words I heard him say
[03:05.86]Were the last words I ever heard him say
[03:10.98]I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
[03:16.10]I said I will return on Christmas Day
[03:21.21]And yes, I shall return on Christmas day
[03:26.33]I shall return, for you, on Christmas Day
[03:31.45]My love
[03:36.56]I will return on Christmas Day
[03:41.68]I shall return ,my love, on Christmas Day
[03:50.97]On Christmas Day
