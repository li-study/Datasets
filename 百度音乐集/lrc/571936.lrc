[00:02.00]Band Of Horses - Compliments
[00:12.00]
[00:18.57]I'm fixing a drink in the morning
[00:22.51]With the way things are
[00:26.34]You may have stayed too long
[00:33.87]It's splitting apart at the seam
[00:37.58]From the hospital call
[00:41.91]You've known him so long
[02:43.55][01:39.03][00:51.50]If there's a God up in the air
[02:47.76][01:43.91][00:55.09]Someone looking over everyone
[02:51.83][01:47.91][00:59.25]At least you've got something to fall back on
[01:07.02]Deep in the heart of the country
[01:10.66]Was a house I built from logs
[01:14.54]A raven and a lady home
[01:22.21]A quiet and calm through the day
[01:26.01]See the sun burn through fog
[01:30.02]Approaching was a yellow dawn
[01:55.63]And what do people really hope?
[01:59.11]Does anybody even care?
[02:03.06]I bet you get a lot of compliments down there
[02:59.64]And do you got something to say?
[03:03.56]Is there something coming over you?
[03:07.45]Do you got important things still left to do?
