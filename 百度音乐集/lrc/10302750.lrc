[00:-1.20]Harder To Breathe
[00:-1.00]Maroon 5
[00:-0.50]
[00:00.07]How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
[00:03.12]So condescending, unnecessarily critical
[00:06.75]I have the tendency of getting very physical
[00:10.03]So watch your step, cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
[00:13.35]You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
[00:16.24]The double vision I was seeing, is finally clear
[00:19.46]You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
[00:22.58]Not fit to fuckin tread the ground I am walking on
[00:25.86]
[00:26.94]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[00:33.03]You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
[00:39.32]and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[00:46.35]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[00:52.96]What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
[00:56.24]You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
[00:59.33]Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
[01:02.71]Hoping somebody, someday, will do you like I did
[01:06.52]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[01:12.75]You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
[01:19.33]and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[01:25.78]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[01:32.34]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[01:37.48]
[01:51.01]Does it kill Does it burn
[01:52.65]Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control
[01:57.47]Does it thrill Does it sting
[01:59.11]When you feel what I bring and you wish you had me to hold
[02:05.19]When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
[02:11.18]You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
[02:17.73]and like a little girl that cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
[02:24.15]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[02:30.98]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[02:35.46]
[02:37.09]Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
