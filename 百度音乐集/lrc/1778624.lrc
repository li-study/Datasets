[00:07.42]Vanessa Hudgens
[00:09.34]Baby “V“
[00:10.34](Baby Come Back)
[00:11.11]Everyday, I try to play
[00:12.76]Another game
[00:13.89]But my heart can’t take it
[00:15.80]I try to find another boy
[00:18.12]But all the world
[00:19.41]I can’t face it
[00:21.48]Why do I miss you so much?
[00:24.25]I want to stop this hurt inside
[00:26.93]Oh baby please,
[00:28.87]Give us one more try
[00:32.01](Baby Come Back)
[00:32.53]
[00:32.63]I see you out
[00:34.10]With all your friends
[00:35.16]Laughing it up as you pretend
[00:37.87]To have a good time
[00:40.15]I know cause I’m living the same life
[00:43.29]So one of us has got to say
[00:45.82]We can’t keep living this same way
[00:48.70]So I’ll be the one
[00:50.82]Yeah, I’ll Say it, I’ll Say it
[00:52.42]I’ll say it, I’ll say it again
[00:54.59]Baby come back to me
[00:57.32]In my heart I still believe
[01:00.05]We were meant to be
[01:02.49]Together, so whatever it takes
[01:04.85](Baby come back)
[01:05.06]Baby come back to me
[01:08.27]I should have never set you free
[01:11.74]My baby...
[01:13.56]Come Back
[01:15.65](Baby Come Back)
[01:16.24]
[01:16.52]I wanna call
[01:17.27]But then I stall
[01:18.20]‘Cause After All
[01:19.16]I just couldn’t take it
[01:21.16]Because if your play
[01:22.44]Was to push me away
[01:23.64]You know the day
[01:24.96]My heart you’d break it
[01:26.88]I know I made a mistake
[01:29.63]Can’t you stop your foolish pride?
[01:32.27]And come back to me
[01:34.51]Lets try, Lets try
[01:35.86]Lets try, Let try it again
[01:37.27]
[01:37.71]REPEAT CHORUS
[01:38.25]
[01:59.90]You know you miss your Baby “V”
[02:01.08]And I can see that you think about me
[02:04.79]So why do you act like you don’t care
[02:07.46]Like all this love between us isn’t there
[02:10.30]I know that you’re upset
[02:11.66]I know I did you wrong
[02:13.01]I know that you want me to pay
[02:15.14]For all the pain I’ve caused
[02:17.42]But in the end It all comes down
[02:18.94]To just one thing
[02:19.27]It’s you and me
[02:20.63]So I say, Baby Come Back!
