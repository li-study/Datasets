[00:45.55]The summer's gone
[00:48.84]and all the flowers are dying
[00:54.88]'Tis you, 'tis you

[01:04.56]
[01:05.25]But come ye back

[02:19.00]the place where I am lying
[02:25.41]And kneel and say
[02:29.08]an "Ave" there for me.
[02:34.80]

[03:06.07]I will sleep in here
[03:10.94]until you come to me.
