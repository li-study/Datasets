[00:21.33]It ticks just like a Timex
[00:24.98]It never lets up on you
[00:28.82]Who said life was easy
[00:32.18]The job is never through
[00:35.73]It'll run us 'til we're ragged
[00:39.43]It'll harden our hearts
[00:43.16]And love could use a day of rest
[00:46.59]Before we both start falling apart
[02:45.90][02:03.07][00:51.44]Pray that it's raining on Sunday
[02:50.42][02:07.50][00:55.80]Stormin' like crazy
[02:54.00][02:11.08][00:59.33]We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
[03:00.37][02:17.35][01:05.78]Baby whatever comes Monday
[03:04.45][02:21.44][01:09.94]Can take care of itself,'Cause we got better things that we could do
[03:35.10][03:24.19][03:13.34][02:30.49][01:18.65]When it's raining on Sunday
[01:31.24]Your love is like religion
[01:35.15]A cross in Mexico
[01:38.57]And your kiss is like the innocence
[01:42.05]Of a prayer nailed to a door
[01:45.49]Oh surrender in much sweeter
[01:49.09]When we both let it go
[01:52.95]Let the water wash our bodies clean
[01:56.48]And love wash our souls
[03:47.30]Let it rain
