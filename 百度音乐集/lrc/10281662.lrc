[00:18.49]Child, it's broke
[00:23.75]And I feel you slipping away
[00:30.40]Child, you spoke
[00:35.70]And the world fell silent again
[00:41.79]Do you love
[00:44.75]Do you need love
[00:54.60]Child, undone
[00:59.94]By fear of falling through cracks
[01:06.62]Child, by one mistake, you've-
[01:15.45]lost your way back
[03:17.10][02:22.78][01:19.02](Somethings gotta turn you round)
[01:24.20]Do you love
[01:26.97]Do you need love
[01:30.13]When your angels shout
[01:33.30]Is your heart strung out
[01:36.11]Do you love
[01:38.91]Do you need love
[01:42.00]When your angels fall
[01:45.00]Have you lost it all
[01:57.73]Child be still
[02:03.71]In the storm to wave us goodbye
[02:10.20]Child we will
[02:15.70]Return to dance with the sky
[02:27.73][02:21.98]Do you love
[02:30.53]Do you need love
[03:52.35][03:28.24][02:33.58]When your angels shout
[03:55.36][03:31.13][02:36.66]Is your heart strung out
[04:22.74][04:11.06][03:46.31][03:34.10][02:39.59]Do you love
[04:25.71][04:13.59][03:49.20][03:37.14][02:42.52]Do you need love
[04:04.57]When your angels fall
[04:07.38]Have you lost it all
[04:32.95][04:20.79]
[03:58.40][03:22.19]Do you love
[04:01.49][03:25.12]Do you need love
[03:40.46][02:45.68]When your angels cry
[03:43.23][02:48.57]Does your spirit die
