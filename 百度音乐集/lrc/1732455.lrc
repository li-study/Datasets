[00:21.81]Well we were born within one hour of each other.
[00:25.19]Our mothers said we could be sister and brother.
[00:28.51]Your name is Deborah, Deborah.
[00:32.09]It never suited ya.
[00:35.71]Oh they thought that when we grew up,
[00:39.33]we'd get married, and never split up.
[00:42.66]We never did it, although often I thought of it.
[00:48.81]Oh Deborah, do you recall?
[03:09.18][02:07.21][00:52.23]Your house was very small,
[03:12.79][00:55.87]with wood chip on the wall.
[03:16.39][02:14.09][00:59.44]When I came around to call,
[03:19.29][02:17.17][01:02.51]you didn't notice me at all.
[03:24.91][02:22.76][01:07.92]I said let's all meet up in the year 2000.
[03:29.30][02:27.29][01:12.57]Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
[03:34.25][02:32.23][01:17.54]Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road.
[03:40.05][02:38.15][01:22.18]I never knew that you'd get married.
[01:25.87]I would be living down here on my own on
[01:30.84]that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.
[01:36.54]You were the first girl at school to get breasts.
[01:39.74]Martyn said that yours were the best.
[01:42.98]The boys all loved you but I was a mess.
[01:46.87]I had to watch them trying to get you undressed.
[01:50.48]We were friends but that was as far as it went.
[01:54.25]I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant,
[01:57.33]oh it meant nothing to you,
[02:00.84]cos you were so popular.
[02:04.05]Deborah do you recall?
[02:10.58]with woodchip on the wall.
[02:41.60]I would be living down here on my own
[03:48.38][02:46.41]on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.
[02:55.60]Oh yeah,
[03:03.81]oh yeah.
[03:06.42]Ah do you recall?
[03:43.70]I would be living down here on my own,
[03:54.53]Oh what are you doing Sunday baby.
[04:12.41][03:58.08]Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
[04:15.96][04:01.66]You can even bring your baby.
[04:05.23]Ohhh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh.
[04:08.87]What are you doing Sunday baby.
[04:19.64]Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Oh.
