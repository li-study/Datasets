[00:00.00]Over The Rainbow
[00:03.00]il divo
[00:07.00]
[00:09.72]Somewhere over the rainbow
[00:17.92]Way up high
[00:27.96]There's a land that I heard of
[00:35.76]Once in a lullaby.
[00:42.66]
[00:45.11]Somewhere over the rainbow
[00:54.64]Skies are blue
[01:02.66]And the dreams that you dare to dream
[01:12.55]Really do come true.
[01:17.40]
[01:19.58]Some day I'll wish upon a star
[01:23.73]And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
[01:30.39]
[01:36.76]Where troubles melt like lemondrops
[01:40.84]Away above the chimney tops
[01:44.82]That's where you'll find me.
[01:52.62]
[02:30.87]Some day I'll wish upon a star
[02:35.52]And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
[02:47.64]Where troubles melt like lemondrops
[02:52.55]Away above the chimney tops
[02:55.81]That's where you'll find me.
[03:06.67]Somewhere over the rainbow
[03:15.50]Skies are blue
[03:23.71]And the dreams that you dare to dream
[03:33.84]Really do come true.
