[00:36.03]He seemed no different from the rest
[00:39.73]Just a healthy normal boy
[00:44.35]His mama always did her best
[00:48.05]And he was daddy's pride and joy
[00:52.97]He learned to walk and talk on time
[00:56.50]But never cared much to be held
[01:01.10]and steadily he would decline
[01:04.78]Into his solitary shell
[01:07.95]As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
[01:12.41]Kept to himself most of the time
[01:17.52]He would daydream in and out of his own world
[01:21.10]but in every other way he was fine
[01:25.97]He's a Monday morning lunatic
[01:30.48]Disturbed from time to time
[01:35.68]Lost within himself
[01:39.76]In his solitary shell
[01:45.47]A temporary catatonic
[01:50.34]Madman on occasion
[01:55.10]When will he break out
[01:58.95]Of his solitary shell
[02:33.62]He struggled to get through his day
[02:37.32]He was helplessly behind
[02:42.08]He poured himself onto the page
[02:45.66]Writing for hours at a time
[02:48.78]As a man he was a danger to himself
[02:53.44]Fearful and sad most of the time
[02:58.39]He was drifting in and out of sanity
[03:01.91]But in every other way he was fine
[03:06.78]He's a Monday morning lunatic
[03:11.39]Disturbed from time to time
[03:16.68]Lost within himself
[03:20.59]In his solitary shell
[03:26.15]A momentary maniac
[03:30.80]With casual delusions
[03:35.97]When will he be let out
[03:39.85]Of his solitary shell
