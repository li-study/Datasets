[00:00.42]
[00:09.94]Look Tracy, how you doing? I ain't seen you for years
[00:12.31]Are you married yet? Any kids? Tell me how it;s going
[00:14.61]I cried so much when I heard you was going
[00:17.11]And my eyes hurt alot when I heard you was going
[00:19.37]While you reading this grab a tissue and smile
[00:22.06]And look at our pictures from school and just smile
[00:24.55]You had the cutest smile
[00:26.82]I won't lie, I pictured you walking down the aisle
[00:29.33]We could have been so happy together
[00:31.55]I wonder if your parents didnt want us together?
[00:33.91]Beautiful, silly at times but real clever
[00:36.50]I won't be surprised if I dont see you, ever
[00:38.91]But that is the reason I wrote this letter
[00:41.44]And if you write back I'd feel ten times better
[00:43.84]I know good things come to an end
[00:46.21]But sometimes its like the wrong things end.
[00:48.34]
[00:48.62]Oh Tracy, when im sad i think back
[00:53.34]I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
[00:57.59]Oh baby when i see us together, our love will never leave
[01:02.87]I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me
[01:07.24]Lets run away ay ay ay ay ay (×4)
[01:27.47]
[01:27.82]I didn't get a chance to tell you how i felt
[01:30.05]Only my mum knew how i really felt
[01:32.38]My heart was crushed and broke into two
[01:34.72]I wish i could turn back time just for you
[01:37.24]Its funny how i see all these girls and dont care
[01:39.77]They know to do music for me, I dont care
[01:42.04]Girls like you come rare, I mean it
[01:44.67]And you dont even have to show it 'cause I believe it
[01:47.06]I made a promise to you and didn't get to keep it
[01:49.54]Best friends forever, remember, forever.
[01:51.99]I need you forever, I'll keep you forever
[01:54.21]But now it's never and I feel so down
[01:56.67]My love's so strong, I need yours now
[01:59.13]Without you I feel like I'm just down
[02:01.47]Could have travelled the world together up and down
[02:03.85]I love you babe, so tell me how you feel right about now
[02:06.45]
[02:07.20]Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
[02:11.05]I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
[02:15.40]Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
[02:20.67]I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me
[02:25.09]Lets run away ay ay ay ay ay (×4)
[02:44.62]
[02:46.08]Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
[02:49.80]I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
[02:54.24]Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
[02:59.56]I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me.
