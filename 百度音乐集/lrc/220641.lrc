[00:25.38]住在窗台上的薄荷草
[00:30.37]它在醒来时就迎著光
[00:35.51]如果会说话 我想它会说
[00:40.87]啊 这样的天气
[00:42.75]只能思念人
[00:49.41]独自走在雨中的小黄狗
[00:54.19]它在散步的路上来拜访我
[00:59.32]想起她曾说 如果想到我
[01:04.77]却找不到人说 就和它聊天
[01:13.76]But,don't talk to a dog at raining days.
[01:23.86]So,don't talk to a dog at raining days.
[01:33.80]我想它有自己的寂寞
[01:38.65]所以才孤独的走在雨中
[01:44.62]Hello, baby dog.
[01:46.25]是否你要借把伞 She is gone.
[01:54.25]I am living in the "house of missing you".
[02:04.06]Cause' I am living in the "house of missing you".
[02:39.62]迷漫房子里的咖啡香
[02:44.90]提醒我你在心灵的异乡
[02:49.53]不再属于我 是否想到我？
[02:55.58]他对你好吗？ 其实~我还好~
[03:03.64]But,don't talk to a dog at raining days.
[03:14.20]So,don't talk to a dog at raining days.
[03:23.62]我想它有自己的心痛
[03:28.96]所以才湿淋淋的走在雨中
[03:33.67]Hello,baby dog.
[03:36.92]是否你和我一样 She is gone.
[03:43.77]I am living in the "house of missing you".
[04:02.13]I am living in the "house of missing you".
