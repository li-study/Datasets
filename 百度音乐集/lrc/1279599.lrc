[00:10.21]Nighttime sharpens　heightens each sensation
[00:20.52]Darkness stirs　and wakes imagination
[00:29.41]Silently the senses abandon their defences
[00:49.80]Slowly gently　night unfurls its splendour
[00:58.16]Grasp it　sense it　tremulous and tender
[01:05.97]Turn your face away from the garish light of day
[01:13.61]Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
[01:21.28]And listen to the music of the night
[01:29.78]Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
[01:37.52]Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
[01:44.03]Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
[01:59.45]And you\'ll live as you\'ve never lived before
[02:09.73]Softly　deftly　music shall caress you
[02:17.67]Hear it　feel it　secretly possess you
[02:26.04]Open up your mind　let your fantasies unwind
[02:33.60]In this darkness which you know you can not fight
[02:40.73]The darkness of the music of the night
[02:49.71]Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
[02:56.73]Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
[03:03.69]Let your soul take you where you long to be
[03:19.14]Only then　can you belong to me
[03:28.59]Floating　falling　sweet intoxication
[03:37.16]Touch me　trust me　savor each sensation
[03:45.92]Let the dream begin let your darker side give in
[03:53.92]To the power of the music that I write
[04:01.21]The power of the music of the night
[04:33.52]You alone can make my song take flight
[04:42.24]Help me make the music of the night...
