[00:08.29]I know that you\'re hiding things
[00:11.58]Using gentle words to shelter me
[00:18.82]Your words were like a dream
[00:23.57]But dreams could never fool me
[00:29.64]Not that easily
[00:33.11]
[00:36.58]I acted so distant then
[00:39.66]Didn\'t say goodbye before you left
[00:47.08]But I was listening
[00:51.74]You\'ll fight your battles far from me
[00:57.78]Far too easily
[01:01.31]
[01:03.84]\"Save your tears cause I\'ll come back\"
[01:07.61]I could hear that you whispered as
[01:10.51]You walked through that door
[01:15.23]But still I swore
[01:17.61]To hide the pain when I
[01:20.08]Turn back the pages
[01:22.57]Shouting might have been the answer
[01:26.99]What if I\'d cried my eyes out and
[01:29.51]Begged you not to depart
[01:33.21]
[01:36.53]But now I\'m not afraid to say
[01:40.87]What\'s in my heart
[01:43.85]
[01:45.85]Though a thousand words
[01:48.27]Have never been spoken
[01:50.58]They\'ll fly to you
[01:52.93]Crossing over the time and distance holding you
[01:58.57]Suspended on silver wings
[02:04.69]And a thousand words
[02:07.04]One thousand confessions
[02:09.33]Will cradle you
[02:11.60]Making all of the pain
[02:13.18]You feel seem far away
[02:17.54]They\'ll hold you forever
[02:24.77]
[02:43.54]The dream isn\'t over yet
[02:46.95]Though I often say I can\'t forget
[02:54.04]I still relive that day
[02:58.81]\"You\'ve been there with me all the way\"
[03:04.99]I still hear you say
[03:08.71]
[03:10.81]\"Wait for me I\'ll write you letters\"
[03:15.30]I could see how you stammered with your eyes
[03:18.31]To the floor
[03:22.15]But still I swore
[03:24.49]To hide the doubt
[03:26.30]When I turn back the pages
[03:29.52]Anger might have been the answer
[03:33.94]What if I\'d hung my head and said
[03:37.31]That I couldn\'t wait
[03:40.23]
[03:43.54]But now I\'m strong enough to know
[03:48.03]It\'s not too late
[03:51.09]
[03:52.93]Cause a thousand words
[03:55.31]Call out through the ages
[03:57.63]They\'ll fly to you
[03:59.95]Even though I can\'t see I know they\'re reaching you
[04:05.68]Suspended on silver wings
[04:11.69]Oh a thousand words
[04:14.04]One thousand embraces
[04:16.43]Will cradle you
[04:18.71]Making all of your weary days
[04:21.10]seem far away
[04:24.56]They\'ll hold you forever
[04:31.87]
[04:49.44]Oh a thousand words (Oh  thousand words)
[04:51.73]Have never been spoken  (Ohhh...yeah..)
[04:54.18]They\'ll fly to you
[04:56.46]They\'ll carry you home (carry you home) and back into my arms
[05:02.11]Suspended on silver wings (Oh silver wings)
[05:08.17]And a thousand words (Oh Oh^^)
[05:10.59]Call out through the ages (Call out through the ages)
[05:13.05]They\'ll cradle you (Oh yeah)
[05:15.30]Turning all of the lonely years
[05:17.41]to only days (Only days)
[05:20.92]They\'ll hold you forever
[05:28.36]Ohhh... 1000 words
