[04:22.00]But your flaps r' wearin' thin
[04:23.00]And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
[04:25.00]But this nightmare never ends

[04:28.00]With ridiculous demands
[04:30.00]An you can take the pity so far
[04:31.00]But it's more than I can stand
[04:33.00]'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
[04:35.00]Tell me how long has it been

[04:40.00]You could be mine
[04:45.00]But you're way out of line
