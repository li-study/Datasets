[00:01.46]Happy New Year
[00:03.29]Abba
[00:06.74]
[00:14.62]No more champagne
[00:17.80]And the fireworks are through
[00:21.01]Here we are, me and you
[00:24.94]Feeling lost and feeling blue
[00:28.39]It's the end of the party
[00:31.94]And the morning seems so grey
[00:35.42]So unlike yesterday
[00:38.06]Now's the time for us to say
[00:44.65]Happy new year
[00:46.09]Happy new year
[00:48.11]May we all have a vision now and then
[00:53.58]Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
[01:00.75]Happy new year
[01:02.62]Happy new year
[01:04.39]May we all have our hopes, our will to try
[01:09.84]If we don't we might as well lay down and die
[01:17.25]You and I
[01:22.60]Sometimes I see
[01:24.67]How the brave new world arrives
[01:27.93]And I see how it thrives
[01:31.77]In the ashes of our lives
[01:35.48]Oh yes, man is a fool
[01:38.91]And he thinks he'll be okay
[01:42.33]Dragging on, feet of clay
[01:46.13]Never knowing he's astray
[01:49.95]Keeps on going anyway
[01:56.92]Happy new year
[01:58.75]Happy new year
[02:00.67]May we all have a vision now and then
[02:05.93]Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
[02:13.22]Happy new year
[02:15.16]Happy new year
[02:16.77]May we all have our hopes, our will to try
[02:22.26]If we don't we might as well lay down and die
[02:30.42]You and I
[02:35.31]
[02:48.50]Seems to me now
[02:51.45]That the dreams we had before
[02:55.03]Are all dead, nothing more
[02:58.85]Than confetti on the floor
[03:02.05]It's the end of a decade
[03:05.97]In another ten years time
[03:09.45]Who can say what we'll find
[03:13.44]What lies waiting down the line
[03:16.89]In the end of eighty-nine
[03:23.80]Happy new year
[03:25.55]Happy new year
[03:27.42]May we all have a vision now and then
[03:32.81]Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
[03:40.23]Happy new year
[03:41.94]Happy new year
[03:43.73]May we all have our hopes, our will to try
[03:49.27]If we don't we might as well lay down and die
[03:57.36]You and I
[04:02.11]
