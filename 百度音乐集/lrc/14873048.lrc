[01:26.64]I stand in the distance
[01:31.18]I view from afar
[01:35.59]Should I offer some assistance
[01:40.16]Should it matter who you are
[04:16.99][02:43.52][01:47.58]We all get hurt by love
[04:21.35][02:48.23][01:52.07]And we all have our cross to bear
[04:25.67][02:52.37][01:56.45]But in the name of understanding now
[04:30.88][02:57.53][02:01.61]Our problems should be shared
[05:33.67][05:24.40][05:16.18][05:05.37][04:37.44][03:22.86][03:04.20][02:08.08]Confide in me, confide in me
[02:24.91]I can keep a secret
[02:27.24]And throw away the key
[02:31.91]But sometimes to release it
[02:36.42]Is to set our children free
[03:56.07]Stick or twist the choice is yours
[04:01.02]Hit or miss what's mine is yours
[04:05.37]Stick or twist the choice is yours
[04:10.05]Hit or miss what's mine is yours
