[00:10:00]Do not get me wrong I cannot wait for you to come home
[00:16:30]For now you're not here and I'm not there, it's like we're on our own
[00:24:30]To figure it out, consider how to find a place to stand
[00:30:40]Instead of walking away and instead of nowhere to land
[00:37:30]This is going to break me clean in two
[00:43:30]This is going to bring me close to you

[00:57:40]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[01:05:30]She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
[01:13:00]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[01:23:20]It's all up in the air and we stand still to see what comes back down
[01:30:00]I don't know where it is
[01:32:30]I don't know when, but I want you around
[01:37:00]When it falls into place with you and I, we go from if to when
[01:43:30]Your side and mine are both behind it's indication
[01:49:30]This is going to bring me clarity
[01:56:50]This'll take the heart right out of me
[02:04:40]She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
[02:11:30]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[02:17:30]She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
[02:25:00]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[02:34:30]This is going to bring me to my knees
[02:41:30]I just want to hold you close to me
[03:06:30]She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
[03:13:00]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[03:20:30]She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
[03:27:00]She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
[03:35:00]she is everything
[03:3900]i needed
[03:41:00]she is everything
