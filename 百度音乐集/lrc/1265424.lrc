[00:01.87]
[00:18.74]I didn＇t have to turn my head
[00:22.10]whenever you walked in
[00:27.10]The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
[00:35.59]My heart beats faster, I hear your name
[00:43.94]I feel my confidence slippin＇ away.
[00:50.85]
[00:52.49]Thought I was doin＇ fine
[00:56.60]Bout to get you off my mind
[01:01.42]I see your face and then
[01:05.64]I＇m wrapped around your pretty little finger again.
[01:15.24]
[01:17.69]It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
[01:26.02]I see no good reason but still
[01:29.95]I＇m tangled in your charms
[01:34.45]My God, you＇re smilin＇ and you catch my eye
[01:42.80]My heart is pounding deep inside.
[01:50.85]
[03:07.12][01:51.49]Thought I was doin＇ fine
[03:11.14][01:55.44]Bout to get you off my mind
[03:15.39][01:59.74]I see your face and then
[02:03.33]I＇m wrapped around your pretty little finger again.
[02:11.60]
[02:16.88]Ain＇t gonna let no man go down without a fight
[02:24.94]Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright day light
[02:33.39]My heart beats faster, I call your name
[02:41.81]I feel my confidence slippin＇ away.
[02:50.33]Thought I was doin＇ fine
[02:54.44]Bout to get you off my mind
[02:58.57]I see your face and then
[03:21.51]I＇m wrapped around your pretty little finger again.
[03:30.94]Your pretty little finger
