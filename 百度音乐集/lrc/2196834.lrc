[00:-4.30]So Sick
[00:-2.78]Ne-Yo
[00:00.02]
[00:03.29]Mmmm mmm yeah
[00:10.37]Do do do do do do do do
[00:15.57]Ohh Yeah
[00:16.79]
[00:20.10]Gotta change my answering machine
[00:23.30]Now that I'm alone
[00:25.40]Cause right now it says that we
[00:28.48]Can't come to the phone
[00:30.40]And I know it makes no sense
[00:33.42]Cause you walked out the door
[00:35.66]But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
[00:41.45](it's ridiculous)
[00:43.16]It's been months
[00:44.13]And for some reason I just
[00:46.45](can't get over us)
[00:48.09]And I'm stronger than this
[00:51.51](enough is enough)
[00:53.22]No more walking round
[00:54.80]With my head down
[00:56.17]I'm so over being blue
[00:58.82]Crying over you
[01:00.77]And I'm so sick of love songs
[01:03.81]So tired of tears
[01:06.37]So done with wishing you were still here
[01:10.82]Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
[01:16.35]So why can't I turn off the radio?
[01:20.23]
[01:20.76]Gotta fix that calendar I have
[01:23.96]That's marked July 15th
[01:25.94]Because since there's no more you
[01:28.61]There's no more anniversary
[01:31.01]I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
[01:34.13]And your memory
[01:36.05]And how every song reminds me
[01:37.87]Of what used to be
[01:40.00]
[01:40.46]That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
[01:44.26]So tired of tears
[01:46.77]So done with wishing you were still here
[01:51.22]Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
[01:56.86]So why can't I turn off the radio?
[02:00.56]
[02:02.25](Leave me alone)
[02:05.05]Leave me alone
[02:07.03](Stupid love songs)
[02:11.17]Don't make me think about her smile
[02:14.41]Or having my first child
[02:16.49]I'm letting go
[02:19.23]Turning off the radio
[02:21.51]Cause I'm so sick of love songs
[02:24.64]So tired of tears
[02:27.19]So done with wishing she was still here
[02:31.61]Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
[02:37.25]So why can't I turn off the radio?
[02:39.90](why can't I turn off the radio?)
[02:41.72]Said I'm so sick of love songs
[02:44.81]So tired of tears
[02:47.44]So done with wishing she was still here
[02:51.84]Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
[02:57.63]So why can't I turn off the radio?
[03:00.26](why can't I turn off the radio?)
[03:02.04]And I'm so sick of love songs
[03:05.09]So tired of tears
[03:07.60]So done with wishin' you were still here
[03:12.06]Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
[03:17.66]Why can't I turn off the radio?
