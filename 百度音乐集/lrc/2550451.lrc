[00:00.00]Kenny Rogers - Lucille
[00:05.59]In a bar in toledo across from the depot
[00:15.91]On a barstool she took off her ring
[00:21.01]I thought Id get closer
[00:23.22]So I walked on over
[00:25.89]I sat down and asked her name
[00:31.00]When the drink finally hit her
[00:33.41]She said Im no quitter
[00:35.91]But I finally quit living on dreams
[00:41.07]I＇m hungry for laughter
[00:43.63]And here ever after
[00:46.04]I＇m after whatever the other life brings
[00:52.47]In the mirror I saw him
[00:54.79]I closely watch him
[00:57.44]I thought how he looked out of place
[01:02.53]He came to the woman
[01:05.03]Who sat their beside me
[01:07.60]He had a strange look on his face
[01:12.50]The big hands are callous
[01:15.31]He looked like a mountain
[01:17.58]For a minute I thought I was dead
[01:22.53]But he started shaking
[01:25.13]His big heart was breaking
[01:27.83]He turned to the woman and said
[01:32.44]You picked the fine time to leave me, lucille
[01:37.85]Four hungry children and a crop in the field
[01:44.16]Ive had some bad time
[01:46.88]Live thru some sad times
[01:49.47]But this time your hurtin wouldnt heal
[01:53.99]You picked the fine time to leave me, lucille
[02:02.07]After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
[02:07.26]I thought how he made him look small
[02:12.07]From lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
[02:17.20]We walked without talking at all
[02:22.23]She was a beauty, but when she came to me
[02:27.16]She must have thought I lost my mind
[02:31.94]I couldnt hold her, the words that he told her
[02:37.16]Kept coming back time after time.
[02:41.88]You picked the fine time to leave me, lucille
[02:47.57]Four hungry children and a crop in the field
[02:54.01]Ive had some bad time
[02:56.38]Live thru some sad times
[02:59.01]But this time your hurtin wouldnt heal
[03:03.63]You picked the fine time to leave me, lucille
[03:14.19]Four hungry children and a crop in the field
[03:20.74]Ive had some bad time
[03:23.01]Live thru some sad times
[03:25.51]But this time your hurtin wouldnt heal
