[00:28.00]I'm like a cat in a cage, locked up and battered and bruised
[00:31.60]I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
[00:34.88]I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
[00:38.25]I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you
[00:41.85]There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
[00:45.35]With the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
[00:48.61]Do you have something to hide? Cause I think that we all do
[00:52.02]I am a child inside, back up and give me some room
[00:55.62]I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
[00:58.86]I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
[01:02.12]They turn us loose in the night, a fuck Jekyll and Hyde
[01:05.60]We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
[01:09.24]So let me go, go
[01:10.83]So let me go, go
[01:12.47]Just let me go, go
[01:14.16]I'd rather go it alone
[01:16.07]So let me go, go
[01:17.68]So let me go, go
[01:19.28]Just let me go, go
[01:21.04]I'm never coming home
[01:22.64]
[01:36.70]Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
[01:40.03]I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
[01:43.52]Up on the side of the field I see a city with lights
[01:46.90]I touch her face when I kneel, she tells me she's not alive
[01:50.38]I am too nervous to run, the kids who scatter and hide
[01:53.48]Still reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
[01:57.08]Her world is waiting for me, a world that I rarely used
[02:04.18]I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
[02:07.47]I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
[02:10.80]They turn us loose in the night, a fuck Jekyll and Hyde
[02:14.25]We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
[02:17.84]So let me go, go
[02:19.36]So let me go, go
[02:20.89]Just let me go, go
[02:22.76]I'd rather go it alone
[02:24.65]So let me go, go
[02:26.15]So let me go, go
[02:27.88]Just let me go, go
[02:29.78]I'm never coming home
[02:31.64]
[03:02.68]I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
[03:05.63]I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
[03:09.06]They turn us loose in the night, a fuck Jekyll and Hyde
[03:12.46]We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside
[03:16.08]So let me go, go
[03:17.44]So let me go, go
[03:19.21]Just let me go, go
[03:20.89]I'd rather go it alone
