[00:05.25]Nicholas:
[00:05.89]Subconscious strange sensation
[00:10.21]Unconscious relaxation
[00:14.63]What a pleasant nightmare
[00:18.95]And I can't wait to get there again
[00:22.15]
[00:23.27]Every time I close my eyes
[00:27.59]Theres another vivid surprise
[00:31.80]Another whole lifes waiting
[00:36.18]Chapters unfinished, fading
[00:38.87]
[00:40.52]Closer now- slowly coming into view
[00:48.39]I've arrived- vlinding sunshine beaming through
[00:54.72]
[00:57.36]There's a house I'm drawn to
[01:01.71]Familiar settings nothing new
[01:06.00]There's a pathway leading there
[01:10.30]With a haunting chill in the air
[01:13.81]
[01:14.61]Theres a room at the top of the stairs
[01:18.96]Every night I'm drawn up there
[01:23.27]There's a girl in the mirror
[01:27.65]Her face is getting clearer
[01:31.24]Young child won't you tell me why I'm here?
[01:38.96]
[01:40.80]In her eyes- I sense a story never told
[01:48.42]Behind the disguise- theres something tearing
[01:53.65]At her soul
[01:54.43]
[01:55.14]Victoria:
[01:55.47]Tonight I've been searching for it
[01:59.48]A feeling that's deep inside me
[02:03.48]Tonight Ive been searching for
[02:07.37]The one that nobody knows
[02:11.31]Trying to break free
[02:14.32]
[02:14.81]I just can't help myself
[02:17.63]I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
[02:22.61]Tears my heart into two
[02:26.09]I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew
[02:32.67]
[02:53.68]Nicholas:
[02:54.75]Back on my feet again
[02:56.85]Eyes open to the real world
[03:01.27]Metropolis surrounds me
[03:03.55]The mirrors shattered the girl
[03:07.16]
[03:07.71]Why is this other life
[03:10.66]Haunting me every day
[03:14.55]I'd break through to the other side
[03:17.42]If only I'd find the way
[03:20.18]
[03:21.44]Somethings awfully familiar
[03:24.19]The feelings so hard to shake
[03:28.18]Could I have lived in that other world
[03:31.24]It's a link that I'm destined to make
[03:35.29]
[03:35.56]I'm still searching but I dont know what for
[03:41.60]The missing key to unlock my minds door
[03:48.15]
[03:55.23]Today I am searching for it
[03:59.08]A feeling that won't go away
[04:03.05]Today I am searching for it
[04:06.43]The only one I know
[04:11.00]Trying to break free
[04:13.60]
[04:14.33]I just can't help myself
[04:17.27]I'm feeling like Im going out of my head
[04:22.23]Tears my heart into two
[04:25.83]I'm not the one I thought I always knew
[04:31.00]
[04:31.73]I just can' t help myself
[04:34.50]I'm feeling like Im going out of my head
[04:39.44]Uncanny, strange deja vu
[04:43.24]But I dont mind- I hope to find the truth
