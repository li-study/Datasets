[00:06.67]Maroon 5
[00:11.97]
[00:19.00]After school
[00:20.37]Walking home
[00:21.79]Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
[00:24.83]I can smell hot asphalt
[00:27.78]Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
[00:31.08]And I cannot remember
[00:33.29]What life was like through photographs
[00:37.19]Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
[00:43.64]And sometimes it's a sad song
[00:47.77]But I cannot forget
[00:50.63]Refuse to regret
[00:51.94]So glad I met you
[00:54.75]Take my breath away
[00:56.35]Make everyday
[00:58.03]Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[01:00.98]And mama I've been cryin'
[01:03.22]Cause things ain't how they used to be
[01:05.90]She said, the battle's almost won
[01:08.83]And we're only several miles from the sun
[01:14.01]
[01:24.55]Moving on down my street
[01:27.71]I see people I won't ever meet
[01:30.55]I think of her, take a breath
[01:33.51]Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
[01:37.98]And sometimes its a sad song
[01:41.83]But I cannot forget
[01:44.32]Refuse to regret
[01:45.70]So glad I met you
[01:48.64]Take my breath away
[01:50.32]Make everyday
[01:51.86]Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[01:54.90]And mama I've been cryin'
[01:57.07]Cause things ain't how they used to be
[01:59.82]She said, the battle's almost won
[02:03.00]And we're only several miles from the sun
[02:06.89]The rhythm of the conversation
[02:09.50]The perfection of her creation
[02:12.39]The sex she slipped into my coffee
[02:15.46]The way she felt when she first saw me
[02:18.51]Hate to love and love to hate her
[02:21.53]Like a broken record player
[02:24.48]Back and forth and here and gone
[02:27.02]and on and on and on and on
[02:31.04]But I cannot forget
[02:32.34]Refuse to regret
[02:33.68]So glad I met you
[02:36.79]Take my breath away
[02:38.28]Make everyday
[02:39.68]Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
[02:42.86]And mama I've been cryin'
[02:45.00]Cause things ain't how they used to be
[02:47.69]She said, the battle's almost won
[02:50.70]And we're only several miles
[02:53.94]Said, the battle's almost won
[02:56.98]And we're only several miles from the sunThe Sun
