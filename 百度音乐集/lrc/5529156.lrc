[00:07.00]El Salvador - Peter, Paul And Mary
[00:14.00]Written by Noel Paul Stookey and Jim Wallis
[00:20.00]
[00:22.91]There's a sunny little country south of Mexico
[00:26.58]Where the winds are gentle and the waters flow
[00:30.66]But breezes aren't the only things that blow in El Salvador
[00:36.10]
[00:37.74]If you took the little lady for a moonlight drive
[00:41.94]Odds are still good you'd come back alive
[00:45.47]But everyone is innocent until they arrive in El Salvador
[00:51.00]
[00:52.62]If the rebels take a bus on the grand highway
[00:56.62]The government destroys a village miles away
[01:00.28]The man on the radio says 'now we'll play South of the Border'
[01:08.28]And in the morning the natives say,
[01:11.94]We're happy you have lived another day
[01:15.49]Last night a thousand more passed away in El Salvador
[01:22.00]
[01:29.75]There's a television crew here from ABC
[01:33.89]Filming Rio Lempe and the refugees
[01:37.51]Calling murdered children the 'tragedy' of El Salvador
[01:43.00]
[01:44.57]Before the government cameras 20 feet away
[01:48.92]Another man is asking for continued aid
[01:52.59]Food and medicine and hand grenades for El Salvador
[01:58.00]
[01:59.34]There's a thump, a rumble, and the buildings sway
[02:03.65]A soldier fires the acid spray
[02:06.93]The public address system starts to play South of the Border
[02:14.72]You run for cover and hide your eyes
[02:18.42]You hear the screams from paradise
[02:22.22]They've fallen further than you realize in El Salvador
[02:30.00]
[02:41.49]Just like Poland is 'protected' by her Russian friends
[02:47.29]The junta is 'assisted' by Americans
[02:50.52]And if 60 million dollars seems too much to spend in El Salvador
[02:56.00]
[02:57.29]They say for half a billion they could do it right
[03:02.53]Bomb all day, burn all night
[03:05.94]Until there's not a living thing upright in El Salvador
[03:12.00]
[03:12.62]They'll continue training troops in the USA
[03:17.28]And watch the nuns that got away
[03:20.94]And teach the military bands to play South of the Border
[03:28.66]And kill the people to set them free
[03:32.20]Who put this price on their liberty?
[03:35.83]Don't you think it's time to leave El Salvador?
