[00:14.08]Being round you is driving me crazy
[00:20.30]Watching you run is making me lazy
[00:26.51]You're trying to buy a place in my head
[00:29.62]Telling me lines I've already read
[00:32.71]Speaking my name to try to confuse me
[00:35.96]Say it again you're starting to lose me
[00:38.90]
[00:39.72]That's alright I'm okay
[00:42.88]It happens every single day
[00:45.97]It's all the same
[00:47.52]But I'm not blind
[00:49.55]
[00:50.62]It's all about you not me
[00:56.79]It's all about the things
[00:58.17]That you're expecting me to be
[01:03.10]There's not enough time to live
[01:09.87]And all that you're expecting me to give
[01:14.80]
[01:15.53]It's all about you not me
[01:21.79]It's all about you not me
[01:28.73]
[01:41.25]You're building my prison brick by brick
[01:47.42]Eating your words is making me sick
[01:53.61]You get what you want
[01:54.87]Cause nothing is sacred
[01:56.47]You're reading my mind
[01:57.95]And leaving me naked
[01:59.60]You say I gotta give before I receive it
[02:03.09]One of these days I'll believe it
[02:05.00]
[02:05.32]It's all about you not me
[02:11.39]It's all about the things
[02:12.67]That you're expecting me to be
[02:17.80]There's not enough time to live
[02:24.51]And all that you're expecting me to give
[02:29.49]
[02:30.14]It's all about you not me
[02:36.41]It's all about you not me
[02:43.66]
[03:09.13]That's alright I'm okay
[03:12.15]It happens every single day
[03:15.29]It's all the same
[03:16.82]But I'm not blind
[03:18.78]
[03:19.93]It's all about you not me
[03:26.08]It's all about the things
[03:27.37]That you're expecting me to be
[03:32.46]There's not enough time to live
[03:39.19]And all that you're expecting me to give
[03:44.46]
