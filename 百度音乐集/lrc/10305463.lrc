[00:04.35]
[00:09.51]I see lovers in the streets, walking without a care
[00:14.39]They wear it out loud, like there’s something in the air
[00:20.45]Oh well, I don’t care
[00:24.93]
[00:26.49]They’re treading lightly, no they don’t sink in
[00:30.94]There’s no tracks to follow, they don’t care where they’re going
[00:40.17]ur ~
[00:40.46]And if they’re lucky yeah they’ll, they’ll get to see
[00:45.96]And if they’re really really lucky, they’ll get to feel
[00:53.32]
[00:55.64]And it kicks so hard, it breaks your bones
[01:00.44]Cuts so deep, it hits your soul
[01:04.87]Tears your skin, and makes your blood flow
[01:11.60]It’s better that you know ..
[01:15.89]love is hard .
[01:20.66]
[01:22.15]Love takes hostages, and gives them pain
[01:26.16]Gives someone the power, to hurt you again and again
[01:34.57]Oh but they don’t care
[01:39.30]And if they’re lucky yeah they’ll, they’ll get to see
[01:43.70]And if they’re really really lucky, they’ll get to feel
[01:48.54]And if they’re, they’re truly blessed, they they’ll get to believe
[01:52.27]And if you’re damned, you’ll never let yourself be deceived
[02:00.08]
[02:01.98]And it kicks so hard, it breaks your bones
[02:06.83]Cuts so deep, it hits your soul
[02:11.66]Tears your skin, and makes your blood flow
[02:18.19]It’s better that you know :
[02:23.06]that, love is hard ..
