
[00:00.06]Enchanted
[00:01.35]Taylor Swift
[00:02.36]
[00:13.50]There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
[00:19.34]Same old tired, lonely place
[00:25.03]Walls of insincerity
[00:28.04]Shifiting eyes and vancancy vanished when I saw your face
[00:34.62]All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[00:45.50]
[00:48.51]Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
[00:51.45]Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
[00:59.92]The playful conversation starts
[01:03.19]Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
[01:11.35]And it was enchanting to meet you
[01:21.39]All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
[01:32.73]
[01:35.60]This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
[01:42.15]I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
[01:47.94]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[01:53.62]I was enchanted to meet you
[02:03.38]
[02:04.75]The lingering question kept me up
[02:07.42]2am, who do you love?
[02:10.44]I wonder till I'm wide awake
[02:16.04]Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
[02:22.32]I'd open up and you would say,
[02:28.22]It was enchanted to meet you
[02:37.73]All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
[02:50.35]
[02:51.72]This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
[02:58.10]I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
[03:03.83]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[03:15.17]This night is flawless, don't you let it go
[03:21.26]I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
[03:27.20]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[03:33.20]I was enchanted to meet you
[03:40.82]
[03:59.15]This is me praying that this was the very first page
[04:05.34]Not where the story line ends
[04:08.00]My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
[04:14.02]These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
[04:19.94]I was enchanted to meet you
[04:25.78]Please don't be in love with someone else
[04:31.00]Please don't have somebody waiting on you
[04:36.50]Please don't be in love with someone else
[04:42.51]Please don't have somebody waiting on you
[04:47.95]
[04:49.05]This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
[04:55.03]I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
[05:00.76]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[05:12.35]This night is flawless, don't you let it go
[05:18.34]I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
[05:24.12]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[05:30.26]I was enchanted to meet you
[05:36.37]Please don't be in love with someone else
[05:41.18]Please don't have somebody waiting on you
[05:47.15]
