[00:18.57]I remember all my life
[00:23.44]raining down as cold as ice.
[00:27.99]Shadows of a man
[00:30.13]a face through a window cryin' in the night
[00:34.56]the night goes into
[00:37.02]Morning just another day
[00:41.63]happy people pass my way
[00:46.34]Looking in their eyes
[00:48.58]I see a memory I never realized
[00:53.19]how happy you made me.
[00:55.17]Oh Mandy well
[00:57.30]you came and you gave without taking
[01:02.16]but I sent you away.
[01:04.45]Oh Mandy
[01:06.81]well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
[01:11.75]and I need you today. Oh Mandy!
[01:23.91]I'm standing on the edge of time
[01:28.56]I've walked away when love was mine.
[01:33.16]Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
[01:37.84]the tears are in my mind
[01:40.04]and nothin' in rhyming.
[01:42.07]Oh Mandy well
[01:44.21]you came and you gave without taking
[01:48.78]but I sent you away.

[01:57.81]and I need you today. Oh Mandy!

[02:18.83]Cry'in our breath
[02:21.06]The pay's callin'
[02:22.83]Oh Mandy well
[02:25.21]you came and you gave without taking
[02:29.66]but I sent you away.
