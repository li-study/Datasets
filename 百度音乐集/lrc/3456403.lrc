[00:18.38]There's a day I never will forget
[00:25.58]The day we met, when we met
[00:35.77]I know that they all thought that you were good
[00:43.50]You were good, we were good
[00:50.35]
[01:11.24]From this day on, I'll follow you
[01:15.50]I'll keep you near, like I promised to
[01:19.57]And I swear to you
[01:22.16]I won't be gone when the night comes
[01:26.69]

[01:53.96]Well, here we are ... here we are
[02:04.21]Now I wouldn't know what to do
