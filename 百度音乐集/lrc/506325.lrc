[00:28.56]Life springs eternal
[00:30.75]On a gaudy neon street
[00:34.75]Not that I care at all
[00:39.46]I spent the best part of my losing streak
[00:45.25]In an army jeep
[00:47.35]For what I cant recall
[00:52.19]Oh Im banging on my TV set
[00:58.16]And I check the odds
[00:59.77]And I place my bet
[01:04.25]I pour a drink
[01:06.92]And I pull the blind
[01:10.05]And I wonder what Ill find
[01:12.98]
[01:13.34]I'm leaving Las Vegas
[01:19.89]Lights so bright
[01:22.86]Palm sweat, blackjack
[01:25.14]On a saturday night

[01:58.17]Find some crossroad trucker
[02:01.09]To demonstrate his might
[02:04.33]But these days it seems
[02:06.68]Nowhere is far enough away

[02:43.12]Waiting for my ship to come in
[02:51.15]But now no joker, no jack, no king
[02:56.19]Can take this loser hand
[02:59.05]And make it win
