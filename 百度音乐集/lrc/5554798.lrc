[00:13.72]Looking through the photos you find in my draw,
[00:20.40]Laughing so hard you're rolling around on the floor,
[00:26.85]At all the bad haircuts,
[00:30.23]And me smoking cigarettes,
[00:33.36]The lustless romantic,
[00:36.69]Trying hard to impress,
[00:40.24]Well that's just me before we met,
[00:46.91]Well that's just me before we met,
[00:52.49]
[01:02.15]Putting down the photos, you look up at me,
[01:08.26]Enjoying the thought of the person that I used to be,
[01:14.55]The things I was proud of,
[01:17.81]The things I regret,
[01:21.23]Some things I remember,
[01:24.56]Some things I forget,
[01:28.13]Well that's just me before we met,
[01:34.79]Well that's just me before we met
[01:40.32]
[01:42.60]Well I've always had a wild imagination,
[01:49.51]And it sees through your heart,
[01:56.02]Which I know can be, a wild combination,
[02:03.18]Like a flame forms from a spark,
[02:09.57]But don't be shy, be brave little champion,
[02:16.94]It's better to live than to hide,
[02:21.80]
[02:23.25]Well that's just me, before we met,
[02:29.58]Well that's just me, before we met,
[02:35.31]
[02:36.95]But don't be shy, be brave little champion,
[02:44.28]Well that's just me, before we met,
[02:48.13]But don't be shy, be brave little champion,
[02:53.79]Well that's just me, before we met,
[02:58.34]But don't be shy, be brave little champion,
[03:04.34]Well that's just me, before we met,
[03:08.94]But don't be shy, be brave little champion,
[03:14.45]Well that's just me, before we met,
[03:21.34]Well that's just me, before we met,
[03:28.03]Well that's just me, before we met.
