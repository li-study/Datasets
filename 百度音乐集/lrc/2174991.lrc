[00:11.86][Verse 1]
[00:24.68]Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don’t
[00:27.63]Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won’t
[00:35.49]Depend of how the wind blows I might even paint my toes
[00:40.72]It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul
[03:24.45][00:46.15][Chorus]
[03:47.76][03:24.86][02:39.00][01:32.36][00:47.21]I’m not the average girl from your video
[03:50.15][03:27.51][02:42.25][01:34.45][00:49.26]And I ain’t built like a supermodel
[03:52.99][03:30.30][02:45.16][01:37.22][00:52.19]But I learned to love myself unconditionally,
[03:55.59][03:32.96][02:47.85][01:40.15][00:54.84]Because I am a queen
[03:57.98][03:35.60][02:50.07][01:43.22][00:57.47]
[03:58.73][03:35.95][02:50.68][01:43.57][00:57.96]I not the average girl from your video
[04:01.25][03:38.73][02:53.42][01:45.77][01:00.59]My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
[04:04.57][03:41.68][02:56.40][01:48.65][01:03.52]No matter what I’m wearing I will always be

[01:07.97]
[01:08.72][Verse 2]
[01:09.16]When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
[01:14.07]Every freckle on my face is where it’s suppose to be
[01:19.95]And I know my creator didn’t make no mistakes on me
[01:24.33]My feet, my thighs, my Lips, my eyes, I’m loving what I see
