[00:02.00]Jenny And Johnny - Switchblade
[00:07.00]
[00:19.96]It's been one long year of Saturday nights
[00:24.47]In the city of a billion suns
[00:28.78]Sleeping through the afternoon
[00:32.22]With your latest only one
[00:36.42]You had her every way from Sunday
[00:40.17]And on Monday morning too
[02:40.88][01:50.79][00:44.25]You used to dine out on a dollar
[01:55.06][00:48.31]With a switchblade in your coat
[02:49.29][01:58.99][00:52.35]You had your young mind in the gutter
[02:53.57][02:02.95][00:56.32]You had your feet on the ground
[03:08.47][03:00.40][02:18.08][02:09.98][01:11.57][01:02.91]See you on the way up or the way down
[03:04.63][02:13.91][01:07.59]See you on the way down or the way up
[01:34.98]It was poverty that kept you sweet
[01:39.47]And dreams that kept you young
[01:43.20]The money started rolling in
[01:47.09]You stopped having any fun
[02:45.51]With your switchblade in your coat
