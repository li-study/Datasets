[00:12.01]you are far
[00:15.43]when I could have been your star
[00:18.80]you listened to people
[00:20.80]who scared you to death
[00:23.19]and from my heart
[00:24.36]strange that you were strong enough
[00:26.94]to even make a start
[00:30.35]but you'll never find
[00:31.97]peace of mind
[00:33.46]till you listen to your heart
[02:21.52][00:36.76]people
[02:25.14][00:40.07]you can never change the way the feel
[02:28.40][00:43.90]better let them do just what they will
[02:34.68][00:49.99]for they will
[02:37.99][00:53.84]if you let them
[02:42.12][00:56.85]steal your heart from you
[02:46.52][01:01.52]people
[02:49.89][01:05.13]will always make a lover feel a fool
[02:53.84][01:10.97]but you knew I loved you
[03:00.23][01:16.97]we could have shown them all
[03:07.66][01:20.97]we should have seen love through
[01:32.36]fooled me with the tears in your eyes
[01:36.72]covered me with kisses and lies
[01:42.70]so goodbye
[01:47.03]but please don't take my heart
[01:55.84]you are far
[01:59.84]I'm never gonna be your star
[02:03.17]I'll pick up the pieces
[02:05.52]and mend my heart
[02:08.94]maybe I'll be strong enough
[02:11.78]I don't know where to start
[02:14.24]but I'll never find
[02:17.04]peace of mind
[02:18.09]while I listen to my heart
[03:16.97]but remember this
[03:18.53]every other kiss
[03:19.87]that you'll ever give
[03:21.35]long as we both live
[03:22.79]when you need the hand of another man
[03:25.22]one you really can surrender with
[03:28.74]I will wait for you
[03:30.58]like I always do
[03:32.10]there's something there
[03:35.19]that can't compare with any other
[03:47.86]you are far
[03:51.69]when I could have been your star
[03:54.90]you listened to people
[03:57.15]who scared you to death
[03:58.67]and from my heart
[04:00.16]strange that I was wrong enough
[04:02.81]to think you'd love me too
[04:06.41]I guess you were kissing a fool
[04:12.34]you must have been kissing a fool
