[00:04.70]Backstreet Boys
[00:07.13]
[00:14.80]Remember when
[00:17.96]We never needed each other
[00:21.40]The best of friends like
[00:25.00]Sister and Brother
[00:27.70]We understood  We'd never be
[00:35.40]Alone
[00:37.20]

[00:47.00]The night is long   And I need your touch
[00:52.10]Don't know what to say
[00:55.00]Never meant to feel this way
[00:58.29]Don't wanna be
[01:01.56]Alone tonight
[01:05.50]
[01:07.00]What can I do to make you mine
[01:13.01]Falling so hard so fast this time
[01:19.35]What did I say, what did you do?
[01:25.54]How did I fall in love with you?
[01:31.50]
[01:37.80]I hear your voice
[01:41.07]And I start to tremble
[01:44.44]Brings back the child  that I resemble
[01:49.80]I cannot pretend  that we can still be friends
[01:55.20]Don't wanna be
[01:58.70]Alone tonight
[02:03.80]What can I do to make you mine
[02:10.00]Falling so hard so fast this time
[02:16.15]What did I say, what did you do?
[02:22.23]How did I fall in love with you?

[02:27.90]Oh I wanna say this right
[02:31.20]And it has to be tonight
[02:34.50]Just need you to know, oh...
[02:38.90]I don't wanna live this lie
[02:42.00]I don't wanna say goodbye
[02:45.28]With you I wanna spend
[02:48.30]The rest of my life
[02:51.30]
[02:55.26]What can I do to make you mine
[03:01.37]Falling so hard so fast this time
[03:07.43]What did I say, what did you do?
[03:13.60]How did I fall in love with you?
[03:16.40]
[03:19.79]What can I do to make you mine
[03:25.77]Falling so hard so fast this time
[03:31.40]Everything's changed, we never knew
[03:38.70]How did I fall
[03:43.23]in love
