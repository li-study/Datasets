[00:02.49]Album: Wonderland
[00:06.52][00:10.59][02:45.59][02:55.61]
[00:11.55]Tell me that you want me baby
[00:14.13]Tell me that it’s true
[00:16.72]Say the magic words and I'll destroy the world for you
[00:21.93]An army for the broken hearted
[00:24.61]Marching through the streets
[00:27.08]Every cities burning to the ground under your feet
[00:32.37][01:13.72][02:18.51]I wanna hold you
[00:34.88][01:16.26][02:20.98]My skies are turning black
[00:37.57][01:18.91][02:23.72]Feels like a heart attack
[00:42.15][01:23.55][02:28.38]And I'd do anything you ask
[00:45.25][01:26.71][02:39.23]I wanna hold you bad
[00:53.04]Melt the polar ice caps baby
[00:55.52]Watch them flood the earth
[00:58.17]I'd do anything to show you what your love is worth
[01:03.40]Won’t you show me your devotion?
[01:05.94]To heal my aching heart
[01:08.46]It’s like a neutron bomb explosion tearing me apart
[01:32.72]Attention please
[01:35.27]We interrupt this program
[01:37.81]With some disturbing news
[01:40.23]World wide evacuation
[01:42.98]We're going to lose
[01:45.52]We’ve pulverised the nation
[01:48.80]I guess it shows that’s just the love could do
[02:31.45]I wanna hold you bad, bad, bad
[02:37.41]Do anything you ask
