[00:22.24]Ben Folds
[00:23.16]
[00:23.42]We'd hit the bottom
[00:26.98]I thought it was my fault
[00:29.84]And in a way I guess it was
[00:32.24]I'm just now finding out
[00:39.11]What it was all about
[00:41.85]
[00:42.13]We'd moved to the west coast
[00:45.48]Away from everyone
[00:48.05]She never told me that you called
[00:53.95]Back was when I was still
[00:57.46]I was still in love
[00:58.56]
[00:58.88]'Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
[01:01.77]And the clouds came tumbling down
[01:04.35]And it's bye-bye goodbye I tried
[01:10.60]And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
[01:13.34]Had to leave myself behind
[01:15.89]And I've been flying high all night
[01:22.17]
[01:22.53]So come pick me up
[01:27.18]I've landed...
[01:49.88]
[01:50.33]The daily dramas
[01:54.72]She made from nothing
[01:57.70]So nothing ever made it right
[02:02.92]
[02:03.23]She liked to push me
[02:06.36]And talk me back down
[02:08.26]'Till i believed I was the crazy one
[02:11.52]And in a way
[02:12.91]I guess I was
[02:14.26]
[02:14.56]'Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
[02:17.15]And the clouds came tumbling down
[02:19.58]And it's bye-bye goodbye I tried
[02:25.78]Dragging the sea of a trouble mind
[02:28.35]Had to leave myself behind
[02:30.92]Singing bye bye goodbye I tried
[02:36.98]
[02:37.34]And if you wrote me off
[02:41.39]I'd understand it
[02:43.70]'Cause I've been on
[02:47.28]Some other planet
[02:49.42]So come pick me up
[02:53.13]I've landed...
[03:00.30]
[03:00.69]And you will be so
[03:04.85]Happy to know
[03:10.62]I've come alone
[03:17.25]It's over
[03:21.10]
[03:21.46]And I'll open my eyes and walk out the door
[03:37.30]And the clouds came tumbling down
[03:39.58]And it's bye-bye goodbye I tried
[03:44.92]Down comes the weight on the telephones arm
[03:48.51]It's okay to call
[03:50.71]And I will answer for myself
[03:56.10]Come pick me up...
[03:57.42](Ba ba's)
[04:07.12]Come pick me up...
[04:08.79]Ba ba's..
[04:16.26]I've landed.
