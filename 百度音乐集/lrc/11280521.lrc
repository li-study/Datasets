[00:01.62]It's like whatever I do... ( Ohhh Ohhh )
[00:05.28]Just can't get through to you... ( Ohhh Ohhh )
[00:10.60]I Never gonna tell you nothing wrong...
[00:15.13]Listen...
[00:15.25]
[00:15.80]Now, now she loved me, shawty I love her
[00:18.98]Used to jump up in the maybach and roll out.
[00:20.84]Used to care, she used to share
[00:22.82]The love that she used to give me can't be found.
[00:25.02]I lost my way, she said she'd stay
[00:27.40]And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
[00:29.51]My stock is down and out
[00:31.12]I used to be worth my weight in gold
[00:33.25]That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
[00:37.36]And that was before the huricane came in and stopped us.
[00:41.30]I told you to leave, but you lied to me
[00:44.35]When you said that, baby no worries I promise to get us back
[00:48.50]
[00:49.07]I know sorries, just wouldn't do it,
[00:52.61]Her Heart is oblitereated, I'm trying to travel through
[00:56.38]But it's like moving mountains...
[01:00.61]It's like moving mountains...
[01:03.92]
[01:05.96]But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
[01:09.52]And the sky turns grey, and the water from the rain,
[01:11.27]washes progress away
[01:13.30]It's like moving mountains...
[01:17.11]It's like moving mountains...
[01:20.66]

[01:55.15]She, she don't touch me I don't touch her
[01:57.84]We ain't really even said a word
[02:00.15]I really wanna give her everything she deserves,
[02:02.14]But the bad took away the good
[02:03.70]She thinks that I'm full of it
[02:05.31]Arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired.
[02:08.16]Every kiss, that I missed, girl you know I'm trying.
[02:12.44]You never believe when I say,
[02:14.05]and I never believe it when you say, I love you
[02:16.25]And I shouldn't complain about it,
[02:18.47] I should take it like a man and walk up out it.
[02:20.77]Cause we will never be the same... oh
[02:24.61]I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame
[02:28.40]
[02:28.94]I know sorry, just wouldn't do it,
[02:31.96]Her Heart is oblitereated, I'm trying to get through
[02:36.33]
[02:39.91]It's like moving mountains...
[02:43.43]
[02:45.46]But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
[02:48.86]And the sky turns grey, and the water from the rain,
[02:50.60]washes progress away
[02:52.58]It's like moving mountains...

[03:22.06]and it feel's so wrong, barely holding on.
[03:35.38]These hills that I'm traveling up,
[03:38.72]she aint showing me love, so I move my love on.
[03:46.23]
[03:51.27]I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
[03:54.70]Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo
[03:58.37]But it's like moving mountains...
[04:02.65]It's like moving mountains... hey
[04:08.08]But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
[04:11.24]And the sky turns grey,
[04:12.34]and the water from the rain washes progress away
[04:15.35]It's like moving mountains...
[04:19.08]It's like moving mountains...
