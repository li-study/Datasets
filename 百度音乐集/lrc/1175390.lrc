[00:24.77]Tell me what you saw that was so bad
[00:30.36]Tell me all the reasons,
[00:33.21]Why you made me so sad
[00:36.27]I wish that I was like you,
[00:39.09]And I'm sorry that I'm not
[00:42.10]At least I still have hope,
[00:47.18]I guess that's all I've got
[00:50.74]
[03:16.74][02:52.40][01:46.91][00:52.92]I know you must be happy,
[03:19.87][02:55.87][01:49.87][00:55.84]Thrilled that I'm not there
[03:22.57][02:58.60][01:52.63][00:59.01]Yet I know that I will make it,
[03:25.72][03:01.56][01:55.71][01:02.23]Make it good for me out here
[03:28.73][03:04.76][01:58.69][01:04.76]And soon I will be smiling,
[03:31.60][03:07.58][02:01.60][01:07.64]Everything will be okay
[03:34.53][03:10.45][02:04.51][01:10.55]I'll not worry anymore,
[03:37.57][03:13.56][02:07.47][01:13.50]that will be my lucky day
[03:41.35][02:11.45]
[01:18.50]I wish that you'd seen something
[01:21.39]Special 'bout me too
[01:23.97]That you would think of something else,
[01:26.91]Not just the way I look to you
[02:36.46][01:29.93]I don't see what you see,
[02:39.27][01:33.20]How different can I be
[02:42.05][01:36.05]And why does it really matter,
[02:46.98][01:41.13]I'm just being me
