[00:04.08]The 2 of Us
[00:04.99]
[00:05.96]------- Suede lyrics-
[00:10.17]
[00:20.28]Lying in my bed, I think of you
[00:26.73]That song goes through my head,
[00:30.92]the one we both knew
[00:34.29]In each line lies another line
[00:37.38]full of sacred sound
[00:41.07]But you're outside where the companies dream
[00:44.85]and the money goes round
[00:45.97]
[00:48.89]Lying in my bed.
[00:52.09]Watching my mistakes,
[00:55.25]I listen to the band they said that
[00:59.00]it could be the 2 of us
[01:00.25]
[01:20.63]The snow might fall and write the lines on the silent page
[01:27.42]But you're outside making permanent love to the nuclear age
[01:34.50]Two silhouettes by the cash machine make a lovers dance
[01:41.70]It's a tango for the lonely wives of the business class
[01:48.73]
[01:49.42]Lying in my bed
[01:52.38]Watching my mistakes
[01:55.62]I listen to the band
[02:02.97]Lying in my bed
[02:06.47]With nothing much to say so I listen to the man
[02:12.27]He said that it could be the 2 of us
[02:20.15]
[02:34.85]I heard you call from across the city through the stereo sound
[02:41.53]And so I crawled there sickeningly pretty as the money went round
[02:44.22]
[02:49.18]Lying in my head watching my mistakes
[02:55.79]I listen to the band
[03:02.48]And the drums beat in my head
[03:06.05]Pianos chime the sound in this prison of the house
[03:16.03]And as the illness comes again can you hear me through the rain
[03:23.02]As I listen to the band?
[03:29.83]As I sing the silent song
[03:33.88]Mime each lonely word
[03:36.92]Please listen to the man he said that it could be the 2 of us
[03:47.55]
[04:35.83]Alone but not lonely, you and me
[04:42.29]Alone but loaded.........
[04:46.11]
