[00:18.01]It's been a long, long time since everything was cool
[00:23.89]I shoulda seen it coming but I guess I'm not the only fool
[00:30.13]There's something growin' on the outside
[00:33.36]Too much missin' on the inside
[00:36.29]Should I waste my time and let you lead me on and on and on and on?
[00:42.34]
[00:43.23]Waiting for the day when I'm complete
[00:47.37]Without you I'm doing what I can to let you be
[00:53.33]Making sure there's nothing showing on the outside
[00:57.76]Something's dying on the inside
[01:00.80]I'm still broken but I'm free
[01:05.30]I'll see you on the flipside
[01:07.04]
[01:12.45]I've got a bruised up heart
[01:15.23]But I'm still hangin' out
[01:19.13]I should take it easy but I'm still gonna get around
[01:25.10]There's something growing on the outside
[01:28.34]Should I waste more time when everything is done and done and overdone?
[01:28.36]Too much missing on the inside
[01:38.63]Waiting for the day when I'm complete
[01:42.32]Without you I'm doing what I can to let you be
[01:49.29]Making sure there's nothing showing on the outside
[01:52.88]Something's dying on the inside
[01:56.20]I'm still broken but I'm free
[02:00.62]I'll see you on the flipside
[02:03.07]
[02:06.70]I'll see you on the flipside
[02:14.48]nothing showing on the outside
[02:17.57]Something's dying on the inside
[02:23.10]Waiting for the day when I'm complete
[02:29.53]doing what I can to let you be
[02:36.21]nothing showing on the outside
[02:39.46]Something's dying on the inside
[02:42.34]I'm still broken but I'm free
[02:46.86]I'll see you on the flipside
