[ti:The fool on the hill]
[ar:Beatles]
[la:uk]

[00:03.00]Day after day alone on the hill,
[00:09.00]The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
[00:17.00]But nobody wants to know him,
[00:19.00]They can see that he's just a fool,
[00:23.00]And he never gives an answer,
[00:26.00]But the fool on the hill
[02:28.00][01:48.00][01:09.00][00:29.00]Sees the sun going down,
[02:31.00][01:52.00][01:12.00][00:33.00]And the eyes in his head,
[02:34.00][01:55.00][01:16.00][00:36.00]See the world spinning around.
[00:43.00]Well on his way his head in a cloud,
[00:50.00]The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
[00:56.00]But nobody ever hears him,
[00:59.00]Or the sound he appears to make,
[01:03.00]And he never seems to notice,
[01:06.00]But the fool on the hill . . .
[01:36.00]Nobody seems to like him
[01:39.00]They can tell what he wants to do.
[01:42.00]And he never shows his feelings,
[01:45.00]But the fool on the hill . . .
[02:16.00]He never listens to them, he knows  that theyç£–e the fool
[02:23.00]They dont like him, the fool on the hill
