[00:40.00]we're running with the shadows of the night
[00:44.14]So, baby, take my hand, it'll be all right
[00:48.16]Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
[00:52.19]They'll come true in the end
[00:56.76]
[01:05.54]You said, oh, girl, it's a cold world
[01:09.89]When you keep it all to yourself
[01:13.75]I said, you can't hide on the inside
[01:18.07]All the pain you've ever felt
[01:23.07]Ransom my heart, baby, don't look back
[01:26.44]'Cause we got nobody else
[01:30.67]
[01:31.86]We're running with the shadows of the night
[01:35.77]So, baby, take my hand, it'll be all right
[01:39.91]Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
[01:44.03]They'll come true in the end
[01:48.24]
[01:49.12]You know that sometimes it feels like
[01:53.18]It's all moving way too fast
[01:57.08]Use every alibi and words you deny
[02:01.77]That love ain't meant to last
[02:05.45]You can cry tough, baby
[02:07.91]It's all right
[02:09.78]You can let me down easy
[02:12.01]But not tonight
[02:14.52]
[02:15.31]We're running with the shadows of the night
[02:19.28]So, baby, take my hand, it'll be all right
[02:23.38]Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
[02:27.39]They'll come true in the end
