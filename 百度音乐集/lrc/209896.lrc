[00:08.80]by Young the Giant
[00:13.15]
[00:18.41]Oh what did I say?
[00:21.44]She's all shook up
[00:27.00]Lost in the summer, man
[00:30.07]We're burning up
[00:35.56]The time don't show
[00:37.99]When the sun gets carried
[00:44.12]The tide curves off your body
[00:50.42]Oh you'll stay with me
[00:52.77]
[00:53.08]I, now I will show you
[01:00.32]It's how I lie
[01:04.77]When no one told you
[01:09.32]
[01:23.61]Oh what did I say?
[01:26.09]She's all shook up
[01:31.69]Vision by the seaside
[01:34.71]We move
[01:40.31]But I don't know
[01:42.60]When the fire gets hazy
[01:48.57]The flames roll down and off her body
[01:55.12]Oh you'll stay with me
[01:57.34]
[01:57.57]I, now I will show you
[02:04.99]It's how I lie
[02:09.17]When no one told you
[02:14.08]
[02:14.45]So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
[02:20.61]I will show you
[02:23.16]We'll go in the night
[02:26.89]Wondering why no one told you
[02:34.86]
[02:36.70]Now I can walk the stones of the shoreline
[02:45.05]And taste the ocean salt when the cold shines
[02:53.42]My words are rolling soft down your south side
[03:01.16]
[03:02.11]I, now I will show you
[03:09.71]It's how I lie
[03:13.84]When no one told you
[03:18.86]
[03:19.33]So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
[03:25.13]I will show you
[03:27.93]We'll go in the night
[03:31.38]Wondering why no one told you
[03:38.50]
[03:41.03]Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
[03:49.58]Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
[03:57.21]Why it goes
[04:03.80]
