[00:06.51]
[00:16.51]Hey lady,you lady
[00:20.52]Cursin' at your life
[00:23.38]You're a discontened mother
[00:27.30]And a regimented wife
[00:32.07]I've no doubt you dream about
[00:35.19]The thinds you'll never do
[00:38.73]But I wish someone had to talked to me
[00:42.61]Like I wanna talk to you
[00:45.62]I've been to Georgia and California
[00:51.09]And anywhere I could run
[00:54.55]Took the head of a preacher man
[00:57.71]And we made love in the sun
[01:01.02]But I ran out of places and friendly faces
[01:05.37]Because I had to be free
[01:09.40]I've been to paradise
[01:12.92]But I've never been to me
[01:16.70]
[01:19.62]Please lady,please lady
[01:23.50]Don't just walk away
[01:26.32]'Cause I have this need to tell you
[01:30.17]Why I'm alone today
[01:34.93]Ican see so much of me
[01:38.08]Still living in your eyes
[01:41.59]Won't you share a part of a weary heart
[01:45.28]That has lived million lies
[01:48.52]Oh I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece
[01:53.05]While I sipped champagne on a yacht
[01:57.12]I moved like harlot in Monte Carlo
[02:00.59]And showed'em what I've got
[02:03.84]I've been undressed by kings
[02:06.58]And I've seen some things
[02:08.29]That a woman ain't supposed to see,
[02:11.46]Hey Lady  I've been to paradise
[02:15.91]But I 've never been to me
[02:19.62]
[02:39.57]Sometimes I've been to cryin'
[02:42.88]For unborn children
[02:44.54]That might have made me complete
[02:47.86]But I,I took the sweet life
[02:50.64]And never knew
[02:51.97]I'd bitter from the sweet
[02:55.20]I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring
[02:59.78]That cost too much to be free  Hey lady,
[03:04.16]I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
[03:10.21]but I've never been to me
[03:14.20]
[03:21.38]I've been to paradise
[03:26.17]but I've never been to me
[03:33.22]
