[00:00.00]Switching Off     Artist:Elbow
[00:08.54]
[00:10.52]Cast Of Thousands
[00:12.23]
[00:13.14]Last of the men in hats hops off the coil
[00:22.02]And a final scene unfolds inside
[00:31.33]Deep in the rain of sparks behind his brow
[00:40.14]Is a part replayed from a perfect day
[00:49.90]Teaching her how to whistle like a boy
[00:59.42]Love's first blush
[01:07.07]
[01:10.39]Is this making sense?
[01:15.40]What am I trying to say?
[01:19.81]Early evening June
[01:23.19]This room and a radio play
[01:28.87]This I need to save
[01:32.88]I choose my final thoughts today
[01:40.32]Switching off with you
[01:49.59]
[01:53.44]All the clocks give inAnd the traffic fades
[02:02.27]And the insects like a neon choir
[02:12.00]The instant fizz Connection made
[02:21.09]And the curtains sigh
[02:25.11]In time
[02:27.52]With you
[02:30.36]
[02:32.62]You, the only sense the world has ever made
[02:41.80]Early evening June
[02:45.22]This room and radio play
[02:50.94]This I need to save
[02:55.29]I choose my final scene today
[03:02.01]Switching off
[03:04.86]
[03:05.58]Ran to ground Ran to ground But I came off
[03:15.01]But I came off pretty well But I came off pretty well
[03:24.82]Ran to ground Ran to ground for a while there
[03:34.26]But I came off pretty well But I came off pretty well
[03:47.36]Deep in the rain of sparks behind his brow
[03:58.70]
[04:06.54]You, the only sense the world has ever made
[04:15.24]This I need to save
[04:19.24]A simple trinket locked away
[04:28.63]I choose my final scene today
[04:35.47]Switching off with you
[04:45.15]
