[00:29.00]How could I forget that I had Given her an extra key
[00:34.00]All this time she was standing there She never took her eyes off me
[00:40.00]How you can grant the woman access to your villa
[00:42.00]Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
[00:44.56]You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
[00:47.00]Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
[00:50.00]To be a true player you have to know how to play
[00:52.00]If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
[00:55.00]Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
[00:57.00]And you tell her baby no way
[01:01.00]But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me) Shaggy
[01:03.00]Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)

[01:26.00]Picture this, we were both butt naked Bangin' on the bathroom floor
[01:30.00]I had tried to keep her From what she was about to see
[01:35.00]Why should she believe me When I told her it wasn't me
[01:40.00]Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix
[01:43.00]Whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
[01:44.50]As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
[01:48.00]Seein is believin so you better change your specs
[01:50.30]You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
[01:53.00]Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
[01:56.00]Wait for your answer: go over there
[01:57.56]But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast

[02:40.50]Gonna tell her that I'm sorry  For the pain that I've caused
[02:45.50]I've been listenin to your reasonin It makes no sense at all
[02:51.30]We should tell her that I'm sorry For the pain that I've caused
[02:56.50]You may think that you're a player But you're completely lost
[03:00.30]That's why I sing
[03:01.30]Honey came in and she caught me red-handed Creeping with the girl next door
[03:06.30]Picture this, we were both butt naked Bangin' on the bathroom floor
