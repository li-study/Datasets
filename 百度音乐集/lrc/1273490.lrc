[00:00.00]Sum 41 - The Jester
[00:06.11]A jester of sorts
[00:07.66]You stand holding your court
[00:09.63]Over minions of capital hill
[00:13.28]In a bath full of blood
[00:15.16]All alone, standing still
[00:17.12]Under God, you can fire at will
[00:19.08]
[00:20.33]And when (when!)
[00:21.88]The devil\'s angels come
[00:24.19]Take your life and lead you
[00:26.68]To the flies beneath
[00:29.33]Go ahead so we kill (hey!)
[00:31.47]And lose the dead who was,
[00:33.82]Above us and beneath us,
[00:36.91]Waiting in their graves,
[00:39.09]It\'s a nation free for all
[00:40.89]
[00:44.03]A prodigal son
[00:45.53]Can\'t undo what he\'s done
[00:47.83]A figure head of capital crime
[00:51.24]With a light shining down
[00:53.17]As you fall to your knees
[00:55.21]To repent would be nothing but lies
[00:57.95]
[00:58.25]And when (when!)
[01:00.25]The devil\'s angels come
[01:03.01]Take your life and lead you
[01:05.80]To the flies beneath
[01:08.31]Go ahead so we kill (hey!)
[01:10.78]And lose the dead who was,
[01:13.03]above us and beneath us,
[01:15.09]waiting in their graves,
[01:17.95]It\'s a nation free for all
[01:19.40]la la la la la la la la la la la (hey!) (hey!).....
[01:28.98]
[01:38.76]Dead beat
[01:39.36]Six feet
[01:40.16]Dead underground
[01:41.30]
[01:43.59]An eye for an eye
[01:44.38]All the leaders are blind
[01:45.67]Going once twice and then it goes down
[01:48.46]And when (when!)
[01:49.80]The devil\'s angels come
[01:52.20]Take your life and lead you
[01:54.54]To the flies
[01:57.67]Go ahead so we kill (hey!)
[01:59.55]And lose the dead who was,
[02:01.85]above us and beneath us,
[02:04.85]waiting in their graves,
[02:07.26]It\'s a nation free for all
