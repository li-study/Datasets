
[00:32.00]Hello
[00:34.00]I've waited here for you
[00:38.00]Everlong
[00:42.00]Tonight
[00:44.00]I throw myself into
[00:48.00]And out of the red, out of her head she sang
[01:03.00]Come down
[01:06.00]And waste away with me
[01:10.00]Down with me
[01:14.00]Slow how
[01:16.00]You wanted it to be
[01:20.00]I'm over my head, out of her head she snag
[01:29.00]And I wonder
[01:33.00]When I sing along with you
[01:37.00]If everything could ever feel this real forever
[01:43.00]If anything could ever be this good again
[01:49.00]The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[01:52.00]You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
[01:57.00]She sang
[02:09.00]Breathe out
[02:11.00]So I could breathe you in
[02:15.00]Hold you in
[02:19.00]And now
[02:21.00]I know you've always been
[02:25.00]Out of your head, out of my head I sang
[02:33.00]And I wonder
[02:38.00]When I sing along with you
[02:42.00]If everything could ever feel this real forever
[02:48.00]If anything could ever be this good again
[02:54.00]The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[02:57.00]You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
[03:02.00]She sang
[03:29.00]And I wonder
[03:33.00]If everything could ever feel this real forever
[03:40.00]If anythind could ever be this good again
[03:46.00]The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[03:48.00]You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
