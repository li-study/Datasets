[00:-0.84]OH MOTHER

[00:14.77]Whoa, oh, yeah,
[03:25.05][03:11.75][03:01.07][02:48.40][02:39.48][02:21.62][02:10.29][01:59.12][01:36.77][01:15.21][01:03.31][00:19.27]
[00:20.36]She was so young with such innocent eyes
[00:25.19]She always dreamt of a fairytale life
[00:30.75]And all the things your money can't buy
[00:36.20]She thought daddy was a wonderful guy
[00:42.50]Then suddenly, things seemed to change
[00:47.75]It was the moment she took on his name
[00:53.03]He took his anger out on her face
[00:58.58]She kept all of her pain locked away
[03:01.43][02:11.15][01:04.72]Oh mother, we're stronger
[03:02.19][01:07.35]From all of the tears you have shed
[02:16.39][01:10.18]Oh mother, don't look back
[01:13.81]Cause he'll never hurt us again
[01:15.92]So mother, I thank you
[01:18.77]For all you've done and still do
[01:21.39]You got me, I got you
[01:24.88]Together we always pull through
[03:23.05][03:21.69][02:37.37][02:34.70][01:31.01][01:28.13]We always pull through
[02:38.85][01:32.64]Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
[01:37.18]It was the day that he turned on his kids
[01:42.77]That she knew she just had to leave him
[01:47.70]So many voices inside of her head
[01:53.39]Saying over and over and over,
[01:56.48]"You deserve much more than this."
[02:00.17]She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
[02:02.84]Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
[02:05.45]So tired of defending her life, she could have died
[02:08.50]Fighting for the lives of her children
[02:13.59]From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
[02:18.70]Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)
[02:22.10]So mother, I thank you (thank you)
[02:25.19]For all that you've done and still do (still do)
[02:27.61]You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)
[02:30.15]Together we always pull through.
[02:39.93]All of your life you have spent
[02:41.99]Burying hurt and regret
[02:44.21]But mama, he'll never touch us again
[02:49.54]For everytime he tried to break you down
[02:52.04]Just remember who's still around
[02:54.85]It's over, and we're stronger
[02:57.38]And we'll never have to go back again
[03:06.28]Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)
[03:10.41]Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)
[03:11.99]So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)
[03:14.25]For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
[03:17.02]You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)
[03:20.86]Together we always pull through (always pull through)
[03:31.18]I love you mom
