[00:16.12]I've had many times, I can tell you,
[00:23.65]Times when innocence I''d trade for company,
[00:29.83]And children saw me crying.
[00:37.39]I thought I had my share of that.
[00:43.13]But these Miss You Nights are the longest.
[00:56.29]Midnight diamonds stud my heaven,
[01:03.16]Southward burning lie the jewels that eye your place,
[01:10.20]And warm winds that embrace me,
[01:17.26]Just as surely kissed your face.
[01:23.40]Yeah, these Miss You Nights they''re the longest.
[02:04.37]Thinking of my going,
[02:11.76]How to cut the thread and leave it all behind.
[02:17.51]Looking windwards, for my compass,
[02:25.56]I take each day as it arrives.
[02:30.70]But these Miss You Nights are the longest.
[01:37.32]Lay down,
[01:38.75]Lay down all thoughts of your surrender,
[01:44.80]It''s only me who''s killing time.
[01:51.04]Play down,
[01:52.29]Play down all dreams and themes once remembered,
[01:58.44]It''s just the same, this miss you game.
[02:44.69]Yes, these Miss You Nights are the longest.
