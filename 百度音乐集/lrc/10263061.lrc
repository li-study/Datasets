[00:08.33]I can hear how you work, practising hard
[00:11.89]Playing night and day, woah-oh
[00:15.68]And it sounds better now
[00:17.74]Yes, you improve every time you play, woah-oh
[00:23.02]But it's bad
[00:25.81]You're so sad
[00:30.59]And you're only smiling
[00:33.15]When you play your violin
[00:38.67]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[00:42.30]To be so near you and not just hear you
[00:46.18]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[00:50.20]I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
[00:53.83]You'd be mine
[00:57.17]And we'd be together all the time
[01:00.40]Wish I was, dum-dum-diddle, your darling fiddle
[01:12.54]But I think you don't know that I exist
[01:16.25]I'm the quiet kind, woah-oh
[01:20.19]From the day when I first listened to you
[01:23.58]You've been on my mind, woah-oh
[01:27.30]You don't care
[01:31.10]It's not fair
[01:34.87]And you're only smiling
[01:37.35]When you play your violin
[01:42.82]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[01:46.42]To be so near you and not just hear you
[01:50.37]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[01:54.89]I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
[01:58.14]You'd be mine
[02:01.33]And we'd be together all the time
[02:05.55]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[02:08.79]To be so near you and not just hear you
[02:12.96]Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
[02:17.59]I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
[02:21.82]You'd be mine
[02:24.68]And we'd be together all the time
[02:27.72]Wish I was, dum-dum-diddle, your darling fiddle
