[00:34.36]Those simple days
[00:35.88]Just you and me, mmmm
[00:39.94]I think baby I know
[00:42.58]What's on your mind
[00:44.38]Cuz you look like you've
[00:45.63]Got something to say
[00:49.56]I may not say those words anymore
[00:53.64]But maybe it just ain't my way
[00:58.78]You ask me do I love you but
[01:01.62]Do you remember
[01:02.93]Why I walked on water for you
[01:06.29]Do you remember
[01:07.82]My first steps on the moon
[01:11.29]Have you ever wondered why
[01:12.72]I gave three wishes to you

[01:17.44]But the answer lies
[01:19.80]In you, in you
[01:24.20]The answer lies in you
[01:29.20]
[01:30.56]Remember we used to laugh and say
[01:34.28]No one else could get in our way
[01:38.19]And there were times
[01:40.90]When you would cry
[01:41.75]And came knocking on my door
[01:44.24]And I was there
[01:45.55]To shelter your pain
[01:49.50]I think baby you should
[01:51.25]Get that off your mind
[01:53.70]Make it seem like
[01:55.63]A brighter day
[01:58.84]I may not say those words anymore
[02:03.42]But maybe I can make it my way
[02:10.76]You ask me do I love you but
[02:13.77]Do you remember
[02:14.87]Why I walked on water for you
[02:18.28]Do you remember

[02:29.67]But the answer lies
[02:31.95]In you, in you
[02:36.77]The answer lies in you
[02:40.98]The answer girl
[02:44.08]Lies within your heart
[02:46.23]Take a look inside
[02:51.13]
