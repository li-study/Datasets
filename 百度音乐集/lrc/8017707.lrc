[00:15.91]Last night was a blur, not a lot of memories
[00:17.69]Black shirt, bare carats on my wrist
[00:19.59]Me and a couple men rollin' up in a whip
[00:21.62]Met a pretty young lady, should I say...
[00:23.65]Will I ever see you again
[00:25.86]Always thinkin' of another man's riches
[00:27.07]Why do you do this to us men
[00:29.51]And that's why we call them bitches
[00:31.06]See I don't understand, she wasn't with a man
[00:32.42]How could I leave without a number in my hand
[00:34.25]I went to go on Facebook, will I get a face back
[00:36.28]Trying to find you is like a needle in a haystack
[00:38.07]
[00:38.73]I came so close, you touched my body
[00:42.12]You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you
[00:45.56]
[00:46.53]I was missing yesterday
[00:47.75]I never took your number
[00:49.68]Now you're nowhere to be found
[00:51.27]I'm going mad, I need you
[00:53.24]I been searchin' all over Facebook,
[00:55.51]and I can't seem to find you
[00:57.23]I really have to find you, baby I need you

[01:07.83]
[01:08.28]Last night I met a fella he made me feel so, oh oh oh
[01:12.64]That can mean what you want it to mean
[01:15.07]Popped to the ladies for a sec (Uh, I'll be back in five, yeh?)
[01:19.13]But when I came back out he left (I felt so alone)
[01:22.59]He left me standing in my LBD and my bang bang shoes
[01:27.52]I was so confused
[01:29.21]
[01:30.18]I came so close, you touched my body
[01:33.65]You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you

[01:55.90]Someone tell me what the hell I should do
[01:57.81]
[01:58.21]Will I ever find someone just like you (I don't think so)
[02:02.59]Not quite like me
[02:03.67]Girl, you're one in a million (I'm one in a million)
[02:06.72]
[02:07.13]Yo, what do I do I need to find you girl
[02:08.47]'Cos you could be the one to make a change in my world
[02:10.15]Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger
[02:12.27]You should try bein' with a singer
[02:13.96]And do you know the meaning of a starking jail
[02:15.92]Until we meet again, my heart's on mail
[02:18.06]Wherever you are right now, I just wanna know that
