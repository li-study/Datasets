[00:30.00]It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
[00:36.00]The regular crowd shuffles in
[00:38.00]There's an old man sitting next to me
[00:43.00]Makin' love to his tonic and gin
[00:57.00]He says, "Son, can you play me a melody?
[01:02.00]I'm not really sure how it goes
[01:05.00]But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
[01:09.00]When I wore a younger man's clothes"
[01:14.00]La la la, de de da
[01:19.00]La la, de de da da da
[04:57.00][03:41.00][01:26.00]Sing us a song, you're the piano man
[05:00.00][03:45.00][01:30.00]Sing us a song tonight
[05:05.00][03:49.00][01:34.00]Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
[05:08.00][03:53.00][01:38.00]And you've got us feelin' alright
[01:56.00]Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
[02:00.00]He gets me my drinks for free
[02:04.00]And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
[02:08.00]But there's someplace that he'd rather be
[02:14.00]He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
[02:18.00]As the smile ran away from his face
[02:22.00]"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
[02:26.00]If I could get out of this place"
[02:32.00]Oh, la la la, de de da
[02:35.00]La la, de de da da da
[02:42.00]Now Paul is a real estate novelist
[02:47.00]Who never had time for a wife
[02:51.00]And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy
[02:55.00]And probably will be for life
[03:08.00]And the waitress is practicing politics
[03:13.00]As the businessmen slowly get stoned
[03:17.00]Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
[03:21.00]But it's better than drinkin' alone
[04:11.00]It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
[04:15.00]And the manager gives me a smile
[04:19.00]'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
[04:23.00]To forget about life for a while
[04:29.00]And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
[04:33.00]And the microphone smells like a beer
[04:37.00]And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
[04:41.00]And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
[04:45.00]Oh, la la la, de de da
[04:50.00]La la, de de da da da
