[ar:]
[al:]

[00:00.00]Love's the funeral of hearts
[00:05.08]And an ode for cruelty
[00:09.81]When angels cry blood
[00:12.75]On flowers of evil in bloom
[00:18.35]
[00:18.76]The funeral of hearts
[00:21.86]And a plea for mercy
[00:26.02]When love is a gun
[00:30.13]Separating me from you
[00:35.70]
[00:39.88]She was the sun
[00:43.12]Shining upon
[00:45.76]The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail
[00:55.80]He was the moon
[00:59.64]Painting you
[01:02.13]With it's glow so vulnerable and pale
[01:09.69]
[01:12.24]Love's the funeral of hearts
[01:16.88]And an ode for cruelty
[01:21.27]When angels cry blood
[01:24.86]On flowers of evil in bloom
[01:29.71]
[01:29.85]The funeral of hearts
[01:33.53]And a plea for mercy
[01:38.18]When love is a gun
[01:41.55]Separating me from you
[01:46.46]
[01:51.35]She was the wind, carrying in
[01:56.53]All the troubles and fears you've for years tried to forget
[02:05.73]He was the fire, restless and wild
[02:13.75]And you were like a moth to that flame
[02:23.55]
[02:58.74]The heretic seal beyond divine
[03:03.78]A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind
[03:07.41]The last rites for souls on fire
[03:12.01]Three little words and a question why
[03:15.96]
[03:22.40]Love's the funeral of hearts
[03:26.87]And an ode for cruelty
[03:31.89]When angels cry blood
[03:34.96]On flowers of evil in bloom
[03:39.86]
[03:40.41]The funeral of hearts
[03:43.53]And a plea for mercy
[03:48.78]When love is a gun
[03:52.56]Separating me from you
[03:58.31]
