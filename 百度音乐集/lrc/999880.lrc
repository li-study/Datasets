[00:00.00]Mcfly - Too Close For Comfort
[00:05.47]Album: Wonderland
[00:15.46][00:23.48][04:12.51][04:32.50]
[00:24.62]I never meant the things I said
[00:26.27]To make you cry
[00:27.25]Can I say I'm sorry
[00:31.29]It's hard to forget
[00:33.28]And yes I regret
[00:35.36]All these mistakes
[00:40.07]I don't know why you're leaving me
[00:42.02]But I know you must have your reasons
[00:46.89]There's tears in your eyes
[00:48.87]I watch as you cry
[00:50.72]But it's getting late
[00:54.84][02:03.07][03:07.76][03:38.99]Was I invading in on your secrets
[01:02.13][02:10.47][03:14.91][03:46.18]Was I too close for comfort
[01:04.50][02:12.83][03:17.48][03:32.99][03:48.70]You're pushing me out
[01:06.46][02:14.79][03:19.18][03:34.86][03:50.50]When I'm wanting in
[01:10.55][02:18.79][03:23.29][03:54.57]What was I just about to discover
[01:17.59]When I got too close for comfort
[01:20.19][02:28.56][04:04.21]Driving you home
[01:23.75][02:32.35][04:07.97]Guess I'll never know
[01:32.94]Remember when we scratched our names into the sand
[01:35.69]And told me you loved me
[01:39.63]But now that I find
[01:41.55]That you've changed your mind
[01:43.77]I'm lost for words
[01:48.57]And everything I feel for you
[01:50.30]I wrote down on one piece of paper
[01:55.14]The one in your hand
[01:57.06]You won't understand
[01:59.28]How much it hurts to let you go
[02:26.02][03:30.47][04:01.75]I got too close for comfort
[02:34.88]All this time you've been telling me lies
[02:38.41]Hidden in bags that are under your eyes
[02:42.31]And when I asked you I knew I was right
[02:46.52]But if you turn your back on me now
[02:49.99]When I need you most
[02:51.42]But you just let me down, down, down
[02:56.22]Would you think about what you're about to do to me
[03:00.14]And back down...
[03:36.85](Yeh yeh yeh)
