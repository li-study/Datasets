[00:09.53]I watched the walls around me crumble
[00:15.31]But its not like that will build em up again
[00:20.10]So here your last change for redemption
[00:25.18]So take it while it lasts because it will end
[00:35.40]And my tears are turning into time I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye
[00:39.17]I cant live without you
[00:42.10]Can't breathe without you I dream about you honestly
[00:47.00]Tell me that its over
[00:51.07]Because the world is spinning and I'm still living
[00:55.31]It wont be right if were not in it together
[01:01.73]Tell me that it's over
[01:06.53]And ill be the first to go
[01:11.11]Don't want to be the last to know
[01:14.48]Don't want to be the one to chase you
[01:18.63]But at the same time your the hart that I call home
[01:25.17]I'm always stuck with these emotions
[01:29.69]And the more I try to feel the less I'm whole
[01:34.00]My tears are turning into time
[01:41.10]I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye
[01:42.79]I cant live without you
[01:46.87]Can't breathe without you I dream about you honestly
[01:51.13]Tell me that its over
[01:55.59]Because the world is spinning and I'm still living
[01:59.64]It wont be right if were not in it together
[02:04.88]Tell me that it's over
[02:08.91]And ill be the first to go
[02:28.14]My tears are turning into time
[02:34.55]I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye
[02:37.16]I cant live without you
[02:40.36]Can't breathe without you I dream about you honestly
[02:44.16]Tell me that its over
[02:48.95]Because the world is spinning and I'm still living
[02:53.53]It wont be right if were not in it together
[02:59.50]Tell me that it's over
[03:20.07]And ill be the first to go
