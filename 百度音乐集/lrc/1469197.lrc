[offset:500]
[00:22]I Sit around and watch the tube but, nothing's on
[00:29]I Change the channels for an hour or two
[00:36]Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
[00:40]I'm sick of all the same old shit
[00:43]In a house with unlocked doors
[00:46]And I'm fucking lazy
[00:48]
[01:36][00:50]Bite my lip and close my eyes
[01:39][00:53]Take me away to paradise
[01:42][00:56]I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
[01:45][00:59]And I smell like shit
[01:47][01:08]
[01:09]Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
[01:16]I sure as hell can't do it by myself
[01:22]I'm feeling like a dog in heat
[01:26]Barred indoors from the summer street
[01:30]I locked the door to my own cell
[01:32]And I lost the key
[01:34]
[01:48]I got no motivation
[01:51]Where is my motivation
[01:54]No time for motivation
[01:57]Smoking my inspiration
[02:10]
[02:21]Sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
[02:27]Call me pathetic, call me what you will
[02:34]My mother says to get a job
[02:37]But she don't like the one she's got
[02:41]When mastur bation's lost its fun
[02:44]You're fucking breaking
[02:46]
[02:49]Bite my lip and close my eyes
[02:52]Take me away to paradise
[02:55]I'm so damn bored
[02:57]I'm going blind
[02:58]And loneliness has to suffice
[03:02]Bite my lip and cloe your time too?
