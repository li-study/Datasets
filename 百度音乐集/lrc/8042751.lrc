[00:10.15]
[00:11.01]When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
[00:13.71]And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
[00:16.18]Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove
[00:18.95]For the first time in my life, I see I need love
[00:21.72]There I was giggling about the games
[00:24.46]That I had played with many hearts, and Im not saying no names
[00:27.27]Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
[00:30.03]As I said to myself look what youve done to her
[00:32.54]I can feel it inside, I cant explain how it feels
[00:35.25]All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal
[00:38.12]Playing make believe pretending that Im true
[00:40.85]Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
[00:43.48]Saying amor kissing you on the ear
[00:46.30]Whispering I love you and Ill always be here
[00:49.06]Although I often reminsce I cant believe that I found
[00:51.58]A desire for true love floating around
[00:54.35]Inside my soul because my soul is cold
[00:57.05]One half of me deserves to be this way till Im old
[00:59.71]But the other half needs affection and joy
[01:02.58]And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
[01:05.17]I need love
[01:16.11]I need love
[01:20.51]
[01:27.41]Romance sheer delight how sweet
[01:29.97]I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
[01:32.45]You can scratch my back, well get cozy and huddle
[01:35.23]Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
[01:38.12]Ill give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
[01:40.83]Kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl youre so sweet
[01:43.35]Its deja vu whenever Im with you
[01:46.07]I could go on forever telling you what I do
[01:48.85]But where you at youre neither here or there
[01:51.39]I swear I cant find you anywhere
