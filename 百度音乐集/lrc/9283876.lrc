[00:01.30]Sugababes
[00:04.63]lyrics By Larry Cheng
[00:17.20]
[00:17.38]Somewhere in the back of my mind
[00:19.29]Secretly I know you will find
[00:21.42]Me amongst the blushing and glow
[00:23.42]Deep beyond the things I don't show
[00:25.32]
[00:25.46]Mystery's a beautiful thing
[00:27.46]What a gift a woman can bring
[00:29.47]Never let it out just like that
[00:31.49]Let him slowly figure it out
[00:33.05]
[00:34.85]How can a flower bloom
[00:37.33]Just over a day?
[00:41.03]And at night
[00:43.14]You gotta let the water drain in
[00:46.23]
[00:47.21]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[00:51.03]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[00:54.75]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
[01:00.84]Denial
[01:02.40]
[01:06.82]You were like a power of nature
[01:08.56]Telepathic beautiful creature
[01:10.64]Understanding all of my weakness
[01:12.71]Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it
[01:14.65]
[01:14.88]Cynical and hurt was just me
[01:16.79]You were never supposed to be
[01:18.52]Part of what I would call amazing
[01:20.78]Took so long to finally see
[01:23.54]
[01:24.17]How can a flower bloom
[01:26.77]Just over a day?
[01:30.65]And at night
[01:32.07]You gotta let the water drain in
[01:35.19]
[01:36.21]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[01:40.10]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[01:43.75]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
[01:50.04]Denial
[01:51.53]
[01:52.64]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[01:56.59]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[02:00.62]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
[02:06.45]Denial
[02:07.28]
[02:09.38]I see the way the wind blows
[02:13.31]Like open minds for us
[02:17.63]No complicated barriers
[02:21.32]To hold us back
[02:23.37]
[02:24.78]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[02:29.40]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[02:33.29]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
[02:39.31]Denial
[02:40.34]
[02:41.72]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[02:45.62]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[02:49.97]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
[02:55.62]Denial
[02:56.39]
[02:58.18]I didn't wanna fall in love with you
[03:02.28]I didn't wanna know the things I knew
[03:06.39]It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
