[00:18.34]Now it seems to me
[00:19.67]That you know just what to say
[00:24.32]But words are only words
[00:26.80]Can you show me something else
[00:29.15]
[00:29.62]Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?

[01:16.74]Now it's hard for me
[01:18.05]When my heart's still on the mend
[01:21.41]Open up to me
[01:25.03]Like you do your girlfriends
[01:27.72]And you sing to me
[01:29.20]And it's harmony
[01:30.60]Girl what you do to me is everything
[01:32.78]Let me say anything just to get you back again

[02:13.39]What if you were good to me?
[02:16.23]What if I could hold you
[02:18.44]till I feel you move inside of me?
[02:21.79]What if it was paradise?
[02:24.52]What if we were symphonies?
[02:28.10]What if I gave all my life
[02:30.45]to find some way to stand beside you?
