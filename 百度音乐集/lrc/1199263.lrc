[00:09.88]Ah, ah,
[00:18.82]We come from the land of the ice and snow,
[00:20.63]From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
[00:24.17]The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands,
[00:31.24]To fight the horde, singing and crying: Valhalla, I am coming!
[00:41.74]
[00:44.72]On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.
[00:52.71]
[00:56.60]Ah, ah,
[01:05.44]We come from the land of the ice and snow,
[01:07.42]From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
[01:10.45]How soft your fields so green, can whisper tales of gore,
[01:18.09]Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are your overlords.
[01:29.12]
[01:31.59]On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.
[01:39.38]
[01:43.82]So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
[01:48.22]For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing.
