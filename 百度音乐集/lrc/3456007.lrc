[00:01.44]saty
[00:02.07]where have you been,
[00:02.09]my long lost friend?
[00:02.74]
[00:08.26]it's good to see you again
[00:08.28]come and sit for a while
[00:16.58]I've missed your smile
[00:16.60]today the past is goodbye
[00:24.65]time can't erase
[00:24.67]a lover's embrace
[00:34.68]can't you hear it calling?
[00:37.66]a new day dawning.
[00:37.67]you were longing to find.
[00:51.37]love's taken you far
[00:55.53]away from my heart
[00:55.56]and I've been here all alone.
[01:02.80]have your eyes failed to find
[01:02.83]what took you from mine,
[01:06.13]a vision that's faded through time?
[01:17.28]but you sailed away,
[01:17.31]a fine summer's day,
[01:24.89]cause you heard it calling,
[01:24.93]a new day dawning,
[01:30.14]you were longing to find.
[01:38.84]there is a way to make you stay.
[01:44.81]daring don't turn away
[01:51.08]don't doubt your heart
[01:51.11]and keep us apart
[01:55.87]I'm right where you are
[02:02.52]stay
[02:41.41]there is a way to make you stay.
[02:49.36]daring don't turn away.
[02:49.38]don't doubt your heart
[02:56.53]and keep us apart
[02:59.96]I'm right where you are
[03:06.63]stay.
