[00:01.50]Elton John
[00:07.50]Can You Feel The Love Tonight
[00:12.50]
[00:15.50]There's a calm surrender
[00:19.50]To the rush of day
[00:23.50]When the heat of the rolling world
[00:27.50]Can be turned away
[00:30.50]
[00:31.50]An enchanted moment
[00:35.50]And it sees me through
[00:39.50]It's enough for this restless warrior
[00:42.50]Just to be with you
[00:46.50]
[00:47.50]And can you feel the love tonight?
[00:55.50]It is where we are
[01:02.50]
[01:03.50]It's enough for wide eyed wanderer
[01:10.50]That we got this far
[01:14.50]
[01:17.50]And can you feel the love tonight?
[01:26.50]How it's laid to rest
[01:32.50]
[01:33.50]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[01:40.50]Believe the very best
[01:55.50][01:46.50]
[02:03.50]There's a time for ev'ryone
[02:07.50]If they only learn
[02:11.50]That the twisting kaleidoscope
[02:14.50]Moves us all in turn
[02:18.50]
[02:19.50]There's a rhyme and reason
[02:23.50]To the wild outdoors
[02:26.50]When the heart of this starcrossed voyager
[02:30.50]Beats in time with yours
[02:34.50]
[02:36.50]And can you feel the love tonight?
[02:45.50]It is where we are
[02:52.50]
[02:53.50]It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
[02:59.50]That we got this far
[03:51.50][03:05.50]
[03:06.50]And can you feel the love tonight?
[03:15.50]How it's laid to rest
[03:22.50]
[03:23.50]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[03:29.50]Believe the very best
[03:36.50]
[03:37.50]It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
[03:45.50]Believe the very best
