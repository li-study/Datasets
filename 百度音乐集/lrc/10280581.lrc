[00:00.00]Great Waves
[00:05.00]Dirty Three with Cat Power
[00:11.00]
[00:17.48]Last boat, stand in a river
[00:22.56]Muddy river, how I love her
[00:27.66]Hawk flying is fooling his folly
[00:32.76]Gas hurricanes spray over Heaven
[00:41.25]Weeping willow is bawling the light
[00:51.75]On fire.
[00:53.93]
[00:55.00]Humans running for cover,
[00:59.15]Wishing for life, gripping the light
[01:04.61]House lift up, trees lift up
[01:10.18]Cars intersect in the middle of the sky.
[01:14.79]
[01:16.00]Oh,time before, no pull, no gravity on the ground
[01:25.55]Givin' up--it's over
[01:30.60]The world's weight is over
[01:33.24]The limit
[01:35.09]
[01:36.14]Our bodies are exploding
[01:40.37]As the sky spills through our mouths.
[01:45.36]All the blue blood is flowing
[01:51.29]The cities, its contents have been ripped out.
[01:56.50]
[01:58.86]The world is gone.
[02:07.54]Did you know it would last this long?
[02:12.98]You made it to the dark, now you're gone.
[02:19.63]You are gone.
[02:25.43]
[02:37.32]Great waves
[02:42.99]Frozen in a secret space
[02:47.93]A great big place,
[02:51.17]Dark-spilling universe.
[02:57.54]
[03:02.33]Last boat, stand in the river.
