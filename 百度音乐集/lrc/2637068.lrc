[00:13.95]I feel your happiness all around
[00:16.75]I'm not sure what I'm getting into

[02:33.34]We've got to work it out
[02:36.48](Nothin' about us makes sense)
[02:38.66]I feel the bridge
[02:40.51]From where I am to where you are
[02:44.10]It shouldn't have to be this hard
[02:50.69]Maybe this could be
