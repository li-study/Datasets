[00:08.93]If you want to live, let live
[00:13.85]If you want to go, let go
[00:18.86]I'm not afraid to dream- to sleep, sleep forever
[00:26.89]
[00:28.74]I don't need to touch the sky
[00:33.87]I just want to feel that high
[00:41.05]And you refuse to lift me
[00:46.16]
[00:49.28]Guess it wasn't real after all
[00:58.75]Guess it wasn't real all along
[01:08.10]
[01:09.16]If I fall and all is lost
[01:17.82]Its where I belong
[01:28.61]
[01:32.83]If you want to live, let live
[01:37.92]If you want to go, let go
[01:42.81]I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender
[01:51.30]
[01:53.39]Guess it wasn't real after all
[02:02.83]Guess it wasn't real all along
[02:12.27]
[02:12.71]If I fall and all is lost
[02:22.06]No light to lead the way
[02:32.19]Remember that all alone is where I belong
[02:51.88]
[02:52.67]In a dream
[02:57.35]Will you give your love to me
[03:07.26]Beg my broken heart to beat
[03:17.01]Save my life
[03:22.00]Change my mind
[03:26.32]
[03:26.72]If I fall and all is lost
[03:36.23]No light to lead the way
[03:46.26]Remember that all alone is where I belong
