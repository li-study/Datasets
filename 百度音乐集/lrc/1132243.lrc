[00:02.17]Sober
[00:05.53]Kelly Clarkson
[00:08.58]
[00:13.54]And I don't know
[00:16.25]This could break my heart
[00:19.27]or save me
[00:22.59]
[00:24.03]Nothing's real
[00:26.85]Until you let go completely
[00:33.99]So here I go with all my thoughts
[00:39.10]I've been saving
[00:44.34]So here I go with all my fears
[00:49.79]Weighing on me
[00:57.51]Three months and I'm
[00:59.47]still sober
[01:08.51]Picked all my weeds
[01:10.95]but kept the flowers
[01:17.27]But I know it's never
[01:21.76]really over
[01:30.53]And I don't know
[01:32.82]I could crash and burn
[01:36.92]but maybe
[01:41.75]At the end of this road I might
[01:46.25]Catch a glimpse of me
[01:51.86]So I won't worry about my timing
[01:57.18]I want to get it right
[02:02.73]No comparing, second guessing
[02:07.79]No not this time
[02:15.23]Three months and I'm
[02:18.71]still breathing
[02:27.10]Been a long road since those hands
[02:32.04]I left my tears in
[02:34.89]but I know
[02:37.53]it's never really over, no
[02:46.14]Wake ....up
[02:51.54]
[02:57.46]Three months and I'm
[03:00.05]still standing here
[03:03.08]Three months and I'm
[03:05.70]getting better yeah
[03:08.53]Three months and I still
[03:12.95]am
[03:18.85]Three months and it's
[03:21.85]still harder now
[03:24.39]Three months I've been
[03:26.60]living here without you now
[03:29.63]Three months yeah
[03:32.24]Three months
[03:40.07]Three months and I'm
[03:42.58]still breathing
[03:45.38]Three months and I
[03:47.86]still remember it
[03:51.17]Three months and I
[03:53.05]wake up
[03:56.87]
[04:07.28]Three months and I'm
[04:10.89]still sober
[04:13.48]
[04:18.39]Picked all my weeds
[04:20.73]but kept the flowers
[04:27.57]
