[00:02.00]Ne-Yo - Can't Stop
[00:08.00]
[00:21.96]Put your pictures away,
[00:26.45]Anything that might bring up,
[00:29.14]Memories of the days
[00:31.75]and the nights we spent in love,
[00:34.97]You were my favorite song,
[00:37.41]Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off
[03:00.74][01:52.75][00:45.01]Girl I aint tripping on you
[03:03.93][01:55.45][00:48.70]I’m just fine
[01:58.35][00:50.64]You hardly ever even cross my mind
[03:10.81][02:03.99][00:55.75]Even though a blind man could look in my face
[03:16.38][02:08.98][01:00.61]and just know that that’s a lie
[03:19.76][02:10.39][01:03.06]I’m barely treading water saying I’m alright
[03:23.61][02:38.97][02:16.21][01:07.59]Cuz I can’t stop crying
[03:26.80][02:41.66][02:19.48][01:10.88]And I can’t stop asking why
[03:30.39][02:44.72][02:21.84][01:14.00]But I can’t stop lying
[03:32.33][02:47.56][02:24.55][01:16.63]And if you ask me I deny
[03:35.97][02:49.90][02:27.34][01:19.24]That I can’t stop crying
[03:38.72][02:52.77][02:30.58][01:22.03]On the outside I’m alright
[03:42.78][02:55.78][02:33.64][01:25.02]But I’m dying on the inside
[01:30.78]Saw you out yesterday
[01:34.02]And I knew that you saw me
[01:36.68]You was with your new man
[01:39.25]And I was with some random peeps
[01:41.97]Suddenly we caught eyes
[01:44.93]And I looked away before it got too hard to breathe
[03:06.29]I don’t even think about you babe
[03:52.53]I’m dying…
[03:56.93]Girl you’re killing me…
[04:06.47][04:01.91]Dying on the inside…
[04:11.39]Killing me, killing me babe
