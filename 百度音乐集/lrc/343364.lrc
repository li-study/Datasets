[00:01.00]Owl City - Umbrella Beach
[00:02.00]
[00:14.69]Stands and gears, oh how the daisies bloom
[00:20.86]When chandeliers light up the engine room
[00:28.14]Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
[00:34.68]There's an underwater ferris wheel where I found the missing link to this island chain
[00:42.57]
[00:43.01]Home will always be here on scenery's side?
[00:51.09]Where I disappear and hide
[00:58.26]I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
[01:05.30]So I'll spread out my wings and fly
[01:13.20]
[01:25.58]Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
[01:33.88]Hidden under umbrella beach
[01:40.10]
[02:22.61]Home will always be here on scenery's side?
[02:30.68]Where I disappear and hide
[02:37.76]I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
[02:44.76]So I'll spread out my wings and fly
[02:52.77]
[02:56.29]I'll spread out my wings and fly
[03:01.16]
[03:04.94]Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
[03:13.36]Hidden under umbrella beach
