[00:03.57]We Belong Together
[00:04.27]
[00:21.58]I didn't mean it when I said
[00:23.50]I didn't love you so
[00:25.08]I should have held on tight
[00:26.43]I never should have let you go
[00:28.44]I didn't know nothing,
[00:29.59]I was stupid, I was foolish
[00:30.60]I was lying to myself
[00:35.06]I couldn't have fathomed
[00:36.61]I would ever be without your love
[00:38.61]Never imagined I'd be sitting
[00:40.16]Here beside myself
[00:41.35]
[00:41.87]Guess I didn't know you
[00:42.65]You'd guess I didn't know me
[00:43.49]But I thought I knew everything
[00:45.41]I never felt
[00:47.38]
[00:48.13]The feeling that I'm feeling
[00:49.79]Now that I don't hear your voice
[00:52.15]Or have your touch and kiss your lips
[00:53.66]Cause I don't have a choice
[00:55.37]Oh what I wouldn't give
[00:56.38]To have you lying by my side
[00:58.73]Right here cause baby
[01:02.04]
[01:02.98]When you left I lost a part of me
[01:06.89]It's still so hard to believe
[01:10.32]Come back baby please cause
[01:12.88]We belong together
[01:14.65]Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
[01:18.39]Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
[01:20.83]Till the sun comes up
[01:21.75]Who's gonna take your place
[01:23.34]There ain't nobody better
[01:24.95]Oh baby baby
[01:26.39]We belong together
[01:28.87]
[01:29.67]I can't sleep at night
[01:30.93]When you are on my mind
[01:32.89]Bobby Womack's on the radio
[01:35.19]Singing to me “If You Think You're Lonely Now”
[01:38.99]Wait a minute this is too deep
[01:40.70]I gotta change the station
[01:43.46]So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
[01:46.47]And then I hear Babyface
[01:48.87]“I Only Think Of You” and it's breakin' my heart
[01:53.03]I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart
[01:56.34]
[01:57.43]I'm feeling all out of my element
[01:59.07]Throwing things, crying tryin'
[02:00.49]To figure out where the hell I went wrong
[02:02.57]The pain reflected in this song
[02:04.30]Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
[02:06.21]I need you, need you back in my life baby
[02:10.77]
[02:11.41]When you left I lost a part of me
[02:14.59]It's still so hard to believe
[02:18.43]Come back baby please cause
[02:21.39]We belong together
[02:23.73]Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
[02:26.78]Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
[02:29.00]Till the sun comes up
[02:30.30]Who's gonna take your place
[02:31.28]There ain't nobody better
[02:33.46]Oh baby baby
[02:34.50]We belong together
[02:37.34]
[02:38.18]When you left I lost a part of me
[02:41.50]It's still so hard to believe
[02:45.57]Come back baby please cause
[02:48.74]We belong together
[02:50.78]Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough
[02:54.02]Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up
[02:57.48]Who's gonna take your place
[03:00.16]There ain't nobody better
[03:01.84]Oh baby baby
[03:02.02]We belong together
[03:08.82]
