[00:33.29]No, I'm not the man I used to be lately
[00:38.89]See you met me at an interesting time
[00:44.99]And if my past is any sign of your future
[00:50.56]You should be warned before I let you inside
[00:55.22]
[00:56.99]Hold on to whatever you find baby
[01:02.38]Hold on to whatever will get you through
[01:08.04]Hold on to whatever you find baby
[01:13.30]I don't trust myself with loving you
[01:17.82]
[01:30.47]I will beg my way into your garden
[01:35.96]And then I'll break my way out when it rains
[01:41.84]Just to get back to the place where I started
[01:47.98]So I can watch you back all over again (I don't really understand)
[01:53.64]
[01:53.93]Hold on to whatever you find baby
[01:59.47]Hold on to whatever will get you through
[02:05.19]Hold on to whatever you find baby
[02:10.34]I don't trust myself with loving you
[02:15.97]
[02:16.77]who do you love?
[02:21.49]Girl, I see through, through your love
[02:28.19]who do you love, me or the thought of me?
[02:33.51]me, or the thought of me?
[02:38.48]
[03:25.68]Hold on to whatever you find baby
[03:31.32]Hold on to whatever will get you through
[03:37.07]Hold on to whatever you find baby
