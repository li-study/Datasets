[00:01.56]How Can I Keep From Singing
[00:02.93]Enya
[00:04.97]
[00:09.84]My life goes on in endless song
[00:18.05]above earth’s lamentations
[00:24.75]I hear the real  though far off hymn
[00:32.94]that hails a new creation
[00:40.85]Through all the tumult and the strife
[00:48.33]I hear it’s music ringing
[00:54.80]It sounds an echo in my soul
[01:03.01]How can I keep from singing
[01:11.36]While though the tempest loudly roars
[01:19.76]I hear the truth  it liveth
[01:26.04]And though the darkness ’round me close
[01:33.37]songs in the night it giveth
[01:39.70]No storm can shake my inmost calm
[01:46.80]while to that rock I’m clinging
[01:53.26]Since love is lord of heaven and earth
[02:01.59]how can I keep from singing
[02:09.46]
[02:29.12]When tyrants tremble in their fear
[02:37.31]and hear their death knell ringing
[02:44.66]when friends rejoice both far and near
[02:52.53]how can I keep from singing
[02:59.79]In prison cell and dungeon vile
[03:06.93]our thoughts to them are winging
[03:13.06]when friends by shame are undefiled
[03:21.47]how can I keep from singing
[03:28.86]
