[00:56.47]Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
[01:03.45]Lavender in your bed
[01:10.10]So innocent as you lie down
[01:16.47]Sweet dreams that run through your head
[01:24.33]Are you lonely without Mommy's love?
[01:30.28]I want you to know I'd die for that moment
[01:37.36]You're just a poor girl
[01:40.74]Afraid of this cruel world
[01:44.28]Taken away from it all
[02:19.93]It's been 5 years to the day and
[02:26.81]My tainted blood's still the same
[02:33.83]I can't help acting this way and
[02:39.96]Those bastard doctors are gonna pay
[02:47.76]I'm so lonely without baby's love
[02:53.67]I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
[03:00.84]I'm just a poor girl
[03:04.26]Afraid of this cruel world
[03:07.75]Taken away from it all
