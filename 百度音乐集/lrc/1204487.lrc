[00:33.78]But right now I don't care about that part
[00:38.52]I bust the windows out ya car
[00:42.61]After I saw you laying next to her
[00:47.36]I didn't wanna but I took my turn
[00:51.83]I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn...

[01:02.97]To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
[01:07.27]I didn't know that I had that much strength
[01:11.77]But I'm glad you see what happens when...
[01:16.38]You see can't just play with people's feelings
[01:20.52]Tell them you love them and don't mean it

[01:29.43]But I think that I deserve to smile
[01:35.22]

[01:41.15]You know I did it cause I left my mark
[01:45.69]Wrote my initials with the crowbar
[01:50.50]And then I drove off into the dark
[01:54.77]I bust the windows out ya car
[01:59.05]You should feel lucky that that's all I did
[02:03.93]After five whole years of this bullshit
[02:08.49]Gave you all of me and you played with it
[02:14.89]I must admit it helped a little bit
[02:19.19]To think of how you'd feel when you saw it

[02:27.90]But I'm glad you see what happens when...
