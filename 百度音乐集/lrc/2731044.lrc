[00:00.58]Kerenn Ann - Chelsea Burns
[00:28.40]
[00:30.00]I was running out of trouble
[00:34.10]You were running out of fame
[00:37.85]Streets smelled like the desert
[00:41.20]As they were putting out the flames
[00:44.35]And Chelsea burns
[00:48.17]Chelsea burns
[00:52.01]Under my feet
[00:54.32]
[01:00.43]Twenty-third was empty
[01:03.89]I heard somebody yell
[01:07.76]A straight-laced passerby's
[01:11.35]Pulled over the hotel
[01:14.43]And Chelsea burns
[01:18.20]Chelsea burns
[01:21.86]Under my feet
[01:24.87]
[01:30.30]Whether we were lost or overwhelmed
[01:36.90]Nobody knows that I'm better off
[01:44.91]Making up lies to be left alone
[01:51.92]And Chelsea burns
[01:55.50]Chelsea burns
[01:59.40]Under my feet
[02:02.86]
[02:37.37]I was running out of trouble
[02:41.18]You were running out of fame
[02:45.07]I'm streets ahead of happiness
[02:48.64]Still wondering who to blame
[02:52.25]Chelsea burns
[02:55.58]Chelsea burns
[02:59.35]Under my feet
[03:02.67]
