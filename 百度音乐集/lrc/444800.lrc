[00:01.08]Over The Rainbow
[00:03.73]演唱：张韶涵
[00:06.90]
[00:27.71]Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high
[00:39.32]There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
[00:51.47]Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue
[01:03.43]And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
[01:15.58]Someday I'll wish upon a star
[01:18.73]And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
[01:23.01]
[01:27.96]Where troubles smelled like lemon drops
[01:30.73]Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me
[01:40.28]Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly
[01:52.01]Birds fly over the rainbow Why, then oh why, can't I
[02:03.74]
[02:28.83]Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue
[02:40.20]And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
[02:52.48]If happy little bluebirds fly
[02:56.05]Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why, can't I?
