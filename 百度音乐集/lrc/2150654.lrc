[01:54.75]If you were in these arms tonight
[02:00.79]We stared at the sun
[02:07.80]And we made a promise
[02:11.71]A promise this world would never blind us
[02:19.26]These were our words
[02:22.00]Our words were our songs
[02:26.11]Our songs are our prayers
[02:29.32]These prayers keep me strong
[02:31.49]And I still believe
[02:33.79]If you were in these arms
[02:36.57]I'd hold ya

[02:55.64]I'd tell you that I'd never leave ya
[02:59.65]And love you till the end of time
[03:04.45]If you were in these arms tonight
[03:10.65]Your clothes are still scatteder
[03:12.59]All over our room
[03:14.52]This old place still smells like
[03:16.82]Your cheap perfume
[03:18.41]Everything here reminds me of you
[03:22.22]And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
[03:26.29]And these were our words
[03:40.58]They keep me strong, baby
[03:52.58]I'd hold ya
[03:53.11]I'd need ya
[03:53.75]I'd get down on my knees for you
