[00:00.00]TURN BACK THE CLOCK
[00:18.36]Another day is ended
[00:23.88]and I still can't sleep
[00:27.34]Remembering my yesterday
[00:32.41]I begin to weep oh !
[00:37.64]If I could have it over
[00:42.27]Live my life again
[00:46.02]I wouldn't change a single day
[00:54.22]I wish that I could turn back the clock
[00:58.37]Bring the wheels of time to a stop
[01:04.20]Back to the days
[01:07.36]when life was so much better oh~no
[01:23.62]Lying here in silence
[01:28.36]picture in my hand
[01:31.42]Of a boy I still resemble
[01:36.15]but I no longer understand
[01:41.06]As the tears run freely oh~
[01:46.83]How I realize
[01:50.22]They were the best years of my life
[01:58.21]I wish that I could turn back the clock
[02:02.79]Bring the wheels of time to a stop
[02:07.16]Back to the days
[02:12.17]when life was so much better oh~no
[02:17.67]You might say it's just a case of giving up
[02:24.59]oh ~no
[02:26.61]But without these memories where is the love
[02:31.09]So where is the love
[02:55.47]If I could have it over
[03:00.61]live my life again
[03:04.12]I wouldn't change a single day
[03:11.88]I wish that I could turn back the clock
[03:16.81]Bring the wheels of time to a stop
[03:21.64]Back to the days
[03:26.17]when life was so much better oh~no
[03:32.09]Why can't I turn back the clock
[03:34.43]Bring the wheels of time to a stop
[03:39.73]Back to the days oh no no
[03:45.95]
[03:46.55]I remember when
[03:48.39]life was so good
[03:53.97]I'd go back if I could
[03:57.43]Oh no I wouldn't change a single day
[04:03.08]Don't let the memoirs slip away
[04:07.48]I wouldn't change a single day
