[00:16.50]Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
[00:19.50]Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
[00:22.50]There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
[00:24.50]Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
[00:27.50]He never ever learned to read or write so well,
[00:30.50]But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.
[00:33.50]Go Go
[00:43.50][00:40.50][00:38.50][00:34.50]Go Johnny Go
[00:44.50][00:41.50][00:39.50][00:36.50]Go Go
[00:47.50]Johnny B. Goode
[00:50.50]He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
[00:53.50]And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
[00:55.50]Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
[00:59.50]Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
[01:01.50]People passing by would stop and say
[01:04.50]Oh my that little country boy could play
[01:07.50]Go Go
[01:18.50][01:14.50][01:11.50][01:08.50]Go Johnny Go
[01:19.50][01:16.50][01:12.50][01:10.50]Go Go
[01:21.50]Johnny B. Goode
[01:59.50]His mama told him someday he would be a man,
[02:02.50]And he would be the leader of a big old band.
[02:05.50]Many people coming from miles around
[02:08.50]To hear him play his music when the sun go down
[02:11.50]Maybe someday his name would be in lights
[02:13.50]Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.
[02:16.50]Go Go
[02:24.50][02:22.50][02:20.50][02:17.50]Go Johnny Go
[02:29.50][02:25.50][02:23.50][02:21.50][02:18.50]Go Go
[02:30.50]Johnny B. Goode
