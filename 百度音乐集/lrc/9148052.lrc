[00:02.00]Annie Lennox - Why
[00:12.00]
[00:41.67]How many times do I have to try to tell you
[00:49.61]That I'm sorry for the things I've done
[01:02.58]But when I start to try to tell you
[01:06.78]That's when you have to tell me
[01:09.39]Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun
[01:23.97]I tell myself too many times
[01:27.28]Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
[01:34.39]That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
[01:39.34]That keep on falling from your mouth
[01:45.28]Falling from your mouth
[01:50.20]Falling from your mouth
[01:55.31]Tell me...
[01:56.98]Why
[02:05.99]Why
[02:16.48]I may be mad
[02:19.39]I may be blind
[02:20.62]I may be viciously unkind
[02:24.39]But I can still read what you're thinking
[02:37.47]And I've heard it said too many times
[02:41.75]That you'd be better off
[02:43.00]Besides...
[02:45.10]Why can't you see this boat is sinking
[02:58.16]Let's go down to the water's edge
[03:04.16]And we can cast away those doubts
[03:09.30]Some things are better left unsaid
[03:13.72]But they still turn me inside out
[03:19.52]Turning inside out turning inside out
[03:29.65]Tell me...
[03:31.29]Why
[03:40.20]Tell me...
[03:41.75]Why
[03:51.29]This is the book I never read
[03:54.77]These are the words I never said
[03:57.40]This is the path I'll never tread
[04:00.11]These are the dreams I'll dream instead
[04:02.78]This is the joy that's seldom spread
[04:05.43]These are the tears...
[04:06.67]The tears we shed
[04:08.09]This is the fear
[04:09.45]This is the dread
[04:10.81]These are the contents of my head
[04:13.43]And these are the years that we have spent
[04:16.30]And this is what they represent
[04:18.76]And this is how I feel
[04:21.09]Do you know how I feel?
[04:24.10]'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
[04:27.16]I don't think you know what I feel
[04:33.67]I don't think you know what I feel
[04:39.07]You don't know what I feel
[04:42.36]
