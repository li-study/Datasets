[00:02.14]Elton John - The Bridge
[00:07.18]
[00:18.61]I've seen the bridge and the bridge is long
[00:22.62]And they built it high and they built it strong
[00:27.03]Strong enough to hold the weight of time
[00:31.78]Long enough to leave some of us behind
[00:36.05]
[00:36.80]And every one of us has to face that day
[00:40.64]Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
[00:43.75]And every one of us that ever came to play
[00:49.99]Has to cross the bridge or fade away
[00:57.43]
[00:58.00]Standing on the bridge looking at the waves
[01:03.51]Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
[01:07.94]On a distant beach your song can die
[01:12.68]On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide
[01:17.69]And every one of us has to face that day
[01:21.59]Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
[01:25.73]And every one of us that ever came to play
[01:30.49]Has to cross the bridge or fade away
[01:37.35]
[01:39.59]And the bridge it shines
[01:44.39]Oh cold hard iron
[01:47.91]Saying come and risk it all
[01:52.50]Or die trying
[01:57.47]
[01:57.55]...
[02:31.52]
[02:35.12]And every one of us has to face that day
[02:39.95]Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
[02:44.11]And every one of us that ever came to play
[02:48.65]Has to cross the bridge or fade away
[02:55.81]
[02:57.00]Has to cross the bridge or fade away
