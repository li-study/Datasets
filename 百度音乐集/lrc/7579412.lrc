[00:06.59]For you I was a flame
[02:24.52][00:46.18][00:22.52][00:10.99]Love is a losing game
[00:16.65]Five story fire as you came
[02:06.98][01:40.87][01:17.57][00:51.16][00:28.01]
[00:29.12]Why do I wish I never played
[00:34.58]Oh what a mess we made
[02:19.69][00:41.34]And now the final frame
[00:55.61]Played out by the band
[01:35.26][01:13.47][01:01.07]Love is a losing hand
[01:07.21]More than I could stand
[01:19.01]Self professed... profound
[01:24.74]Till the chips were down
[01:30.58]...know you're a gambling man
[01:45.13]Though I'm rather blind
[02:01.58][01:50.03]Love is a fate resigned
[01:56.59]Memories mar my mind
[02:08.24]Over futile odds
[02:13.75]And laughed at by the gods
