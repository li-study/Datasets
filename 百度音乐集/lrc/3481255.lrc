[00:14.85]
[00:16.85]Playground schoolbell rings, again
[00:30.66]Rainclouds come to play, again
[00:44.17]Has no one told you she's not breathing?
[00:54.03]Hello, I'm your mind,
[00:59.15]giving you someone to talk to
[01:07.75]Hello
[01:10.33]
[01:25.19]If I smile and don't believe
[01:38.70]Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
[01:52.36]Don't try to fix me
[01:57.17]I'm not broken
[02:02.18]Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
[02:16.87]Don't cry...
