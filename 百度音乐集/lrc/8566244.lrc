[00:03.64]Melissa Etheridge
[00:04.40]
[00:05.12]Have I been sleeping
[00:08.66]I’ve been so still
[00:11.32]Afraid of crumbling
[00:14.02]Have I been careless?
[00:18.27]Dismissing all the distant rumblings
[00:24.51]Take me where I am supposed to be
[00:30.90]To comprehend the things that I can’t see
[00:36.13]
[00:37.05]Cause I need to move
[00:40.51]I need to wake up
[00:43.47]I need to change
[00:46.16]I need to shake up
[00:49.76]I need to speak out
[00:52.10]Something’s got to break up
[00:56.22]I’ve been asleep
[00:59.47]And I need to wake up
[01:04.53]Now
[01:05.47]
[01:09.00]And as a child
[01:11.83]I danced like it was 1999
[01:19.10]My dreams were wild
[01:22.52]But the promise of this new world
[01:27.52]Would be mine
[01:29.81]Now I am throwing off the carelessness of youth
[01:35.29]To listen to an inconvenient truth
[01:40.00]
[01:41.00]Well I need to move
[01:45.06]I need to wake up
[01:48.49]I need to change
[01:51.92]I need to shake up
[01:54.85]I need to speak out
[01:57.65]Something’s got to break up
[02:01.35]I’ve been asleep
[02:04.43]And I need to wake up
[02:09.36]Now
[02:12.58]
[02:14.00]I am not an island
[02:17.44]I am not alone
[02:20.78]I am my intentions
[02:26.80]Trapped here in this flesh and bone
[02:32.48]
[02:33.02]And I need to move
[02:37.90]I need to wake up
[02:40.71]I need to change
[02:43.52]I need to shake up
[02:46.59]I need to speak out
[02:49.51]Something’s got to break up
[02:52.99]I’ve been asleep
[02:56.30]And I need to wake up
[03:01.20]Now
[03:02.60]
[03:06.22]I want to change
[03:09.50]I need to shake up
[03:12.57]I need to speak out
[03:15.14]Something’s got to break up
[03:18.73]I’ve been asleep
[03:22.07]And I need to wake up
[03:26.59]Now
[03:28.07]
