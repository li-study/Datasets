[00:17.97]Let Down
[00:19.31]Radiohead
[00:21.68]Transport, motorways and tramlines,
[00:28.89]starting and then stopping,
[00:33.59]taking off and landing,
[00:38.27]the emptiest of feelings,
[00:43.39]disappointed people, clinging on to bottles,
[00:52.51]and when it comes it's so, so, disappointing.
[00:56.79]
[00:59.70]Let down and hanging around,
[01:06.39]crushed like a bug in the ground.
[01:13.52]Let down and hanging around.
[01:22.64]
[01:29.22]Shell smashed, juices flowing
[01:35.49]wings twitch, legs are going,
[01:39.76]don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel.
[01:48.79]One day, I'm gonna grow wings,
[01:55.57]a chemical reaction,
[02:00.87]hysterical and useless
[02:05.45]hysterical and
[02:07.11]
[02:08.16]let down and hanging around,
[02:13.90]crushed like a bug in the ground.
[02:21.55]Let down and hanging around.
[02:34.98]
[03:06.57]Let down,
[03:15.56]Let down,
[03:25.67]Let down.
[03:36.31]
[03:41.03]You know, you know where you are with,
[03:47.82]you know where you are with,
[03:52.63]floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back
[03:58.91]and one day, I'm gonna grow wings,
[04:05.89]a chemical reaction,
[04:10.49]hysterical and useless
[04:15.11]hysterical and
[04:16.95]
[04:17.67]let down and hanging around,
[04:24.29]crushed like a bug in the ground.
[04:31.35]Let down and hanging around
