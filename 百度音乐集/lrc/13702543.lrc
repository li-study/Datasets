[00:27.83]If I woulda went home with you
[00:30.32]To give you everything you wanted
[00:32.83]It woulda been way to soon

[01:25.99][00:36.78]I try to be tough
[01:27.71][00:38.01]I try to walk away
[01:29.75][00:40.58]I try to be innocent
[01:31.36][00:41.92]I try to be rough
[01:32.86][00:43.39]But I just wanna play
