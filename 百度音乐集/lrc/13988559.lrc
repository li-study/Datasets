[00:20.84]专辑《Beyond Reality》
[00:31.86]
[00:57.74]Shadow lies bloodless on the hill
[01:04.28]Frozen in the night of forgiven
[01:12.83]Ceased to exist, in one life
[01:18.84]As only the memory that remains
[01:27.00]In the woods, where\'s eternity?I sit in the valley
[01:33.80]of greed and dayligh
[01:41.16]Love to the stars and my Elven-dryad My own savior,
[01:48.20]angel of night,
[01:55.00]my betrothed
[02:00.00]
[02:03.23]For aeons I was with you, my friends
[02:07.50]Amongst the mortals in their dreams
[02:11.59]Burned out in the one star\'s end
[02:14.86]Among enlightened thousands shining
[02:29.23]
[02:35.68]Gazing the from the sky, night in my eyes
[02:42.74]As Elf I watch you, in my memories
[02:50.36]So bright, doomed to die in starlight
[02:57.00]Eternally I walk in the twiligh
[03:06.23]
[03:47.23]And bright are the stars that smile on me
[03:54.66]And great is the joy I had with you
[04:02.00]And remember me as the wolf that stares
[04:09.16]With love, in the forest of dreams
[04:16.76]With yellow eyes
[04:18.20]all wise with color of Grey
[04:24.79]So many times I was a stranger with you
[04:30.09]Just a tiny little shadow that frightened
[04:38.63]All days and nights,
[04:44.72]ran away
[04:48.02]in the rain
[04:53.18]Gazing the from the sky, night in my eyes
[04:59.24]As Elf I watch you, in my memories
[05:08.00]So bright, doomed to die in starlight
[05:14.30]Eternally I walk in the twiligh
[05:23.16]
[06:35.58]Where the trees
[06:37.88]are living and flowers are blue I dream
[06:44.08]of the stars and my angel with me
[06:57.08]
