[00:01.12]Lights - Pretend
[00:05.89]
[00:15.14]Once in a while I act like a child
[00:19.04]To feel like a kid again
[00:23.66]It feels like a prison
[00:25.87]In the body you‘re living in
[00:29.49]
[02:26.40][00:30.40]Because everyone?s watching
[02:28.62][00:32.53]Greedy to start talking
[02:30.54][00:34.59]I’m losing my innocence
[02:35.39][00:39.20]Wish I weren‘t a little girl
[02:37.91][00:41.89]Who felt the weight of the world
[02:42.20][00:45.09]
[02:42.61][00:46.28]It would be nice to start over again
[02:48.71][00:52.68]Before we burn out
[02:52.43][00:56.28]I’d give my breath
[02:55.91][00:59.92]Let‘s play pretend
[01:03.96]
[01:09.13]Remember the times
[01:11.20]We had soda for wine
[01:13.21]And got by on gratitude
[01:17.88]The worst they could do to you
[01:20.36]Was check your attitude
[01:23.53]
[01:24.26]Yeah, when fights were for fun
[01:26.66]We had water for guns
[01:28.53]And a place we could call our own
[01:33.69]How we lost hold of that
[01:35.83]I guess I’ll never know
[01:40.31]
[01:40.97]It would be nice to start over again
[01:46.75]Before we burn out
[01:50.46]I‘d give my breath
[01:53.89]Let’s play pretend
[02:59.60][01:58.21]
[03:00.54][01:58.69]And when it‘s the end
[03:04.26][02:02.42]Our lives will make sense
[03:07.82][02:05.90]And love, even
[03:10.54][02:08.47]We won’t have to play pretend
[03:21.43][02:19.46]
