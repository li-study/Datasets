[00:18.00]Tell me lies, slap me on the face, just...
[00:23.00]Improvise, do something really clever,
[00:27.01]That′ll make me hate your name forever

[00:42.00]Well, let me say, you′re not too far from maybe
[00:46.00]Every day you find new ways to hurt me
[00:53.00]But I can′t help it if I′m just a fool
[00:59.90]Always having my heart set on you
[01:04.41]Till the time you start changing the rules,
[01:09.21]I′ll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
