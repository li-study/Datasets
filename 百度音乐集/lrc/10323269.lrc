[00:04.50]Just The Way You Are
[00:06.50]
[00:08.50]Don't go changing,
[00:12.50]To try and please me
[00:15.50]You never let me down before
[00:22.50]Don't imagine
[00:26.50]you're too familiar
[00:29.50]And I don't see you anymore
[00:33.50]
[00:35.50]I would not leave you
[00:38.50]in times of trouble
[00:43.50]We never could have come this far
[00:48.50]
[00:49.50]I took the good times,
[00:53.50]I'll take the bad times
[00:57.50]I'll take you just the way you are
[01:03.50]
[01:08.67]Don't go trying some new fashion
[01:15.26]Don't change the color of your hair
[01:21.72]You always have my unspoken passion
[01:28.39]Although I might not seem to care
[01:36.10]I don't want clever conversation
[01:43.28]I never want to work that hard
[01:49.48]I just want someone that I can talk to
[01:56.06]I want you just the way you are.
[02:06.00]
[02:06.86]I need to know that you will always be
[02:13.62]The same old someone that I knew
[02:20.47]What will it take till you believe in me
[02:27.55]The way that I believe in you.
[02:33.00]
[02:33.63]I said I love you and that's forever
[02:41.15]And this I promise from the heart
[02:48.07]I could not love you any better
[02:55.08]I love you just the way you are.
