[00:10.17]Felony--Tonite
[00:11.05]--lndjove--
[00:12.65]......
[00:17.54]Hey baby, I'm sorry for all I've done
[00:23.44]I can't change the past, it's all gone
[00:27.08]But I will change the future I'll try hard
[00:36.15]Step by step and bit by bit, heart by heart
[00:41.91]There's a light inside your eyes
[00:50.36]I remember the first day I saw this light
[00:58.40]I don't know why, I promised to die
[01:08.31]I don't know why, I promised to cry
[01:20.21]She's all alone on this way of mystery
[01:25.52]And I hope my soul will turn to see
[01:30.48]I can follow her to eternity
[01:39.44]
[01:41.95]Well there's a girl who's sitting there
[01:50.69]She takes my hand and tells me that she'll care
[01:59.70]She doesn't know,
[02:02.72]the pain inside my heart
[02:07.74]She listens where it's gone
[02:12.74]and brought it back home
[02:20.50]She's been so kind,
[02:24.14]and in the night I fall, falling
[02:30.31]She's been alone in this world
[02:44.26]......
[02:55.34]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[02:58.24]The sun will rise again
[03:05.23]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[03:08.15]Nothing will stay the same
[03:14.94]......
[03:36.49]The thin ice I'm walking on starts to break
[03:45.84]She's the one
[03:47.40]I must choose which way to take
[03:56.11]All the doubt
[03:57.79]it lays back behind
[04:05.90]We both are winners
[04:07.78]and I've opened my mind - open my mind
[04:20.17]......
[05:10.40]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[05:18.36]The sun will rise again
[05:25.35]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[05:28.58]Nothing will stay the same
[05:35.50]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[05:38.66]The sun will rise again
[05:45.73]Tonite, tonite, tonite
[05:48.51]Nothing will stay the same
[06:07.80]......
