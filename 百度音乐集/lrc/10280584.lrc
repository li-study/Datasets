[00:00.00]Johnta Austin - This Night
[00:05.00]
[00:32.52]I want this life
[00:35.42]I want this love
[00:38.32]I want this kiss
[00:41.20]I want this hug
[00:43.11]
[00:43.80]Here we are, you and me
[00:46.62]Love is sealed, can't you see?
[00:49.56]Just for us, no one else
[00:52.42]At least that's the way it feels
[00:55.78]And I'm grateful to be in your arms this evening
[01:01.52]I was unsure, but now you got me believing
[01:06.90]
[01:07.57]That time is what you make of it
[01:11.04]And love comes first
[01:13.56]And I've waited for so long just to say these words
[01:18.80]
[03:37.02][03:13.39][02:11.84][01:19.23]I want this life, I want this love
[03:39.64][03:16.30][02:14.87][01:22.15]I want this kiss, I want this hug
[03:42.56][03:19.19][02:17.66][01:25.09]I want this time, I want this night
[03:45.46][03:22.12][02:20.60][01:27.96]I want you here by my side
[03:48.42][03:25.04][02:23.50][01:30.89]I want every little thing that makes my heart sing
[03:51.69][03:28.25][02:26.69][01:34.19]And everything you try just to make it right
[03:54.61][03:31.21][02:29.70][01:37.08]If I'm being honest baby you got all that I need
[03:59.11][03:35.79][02:34.11][01:41.49]It's true you got a hold on me
[01:45.35][03:36.80]
[01:48.46]There's no other place that I would rather be right now
[01:54.20]And the look on my face is what happiness is all about
[01:59.92]Feelings come, feelings go
[02:02.86]But what we have lasts forever
[02:06.05]There's a lot that I don't know
[02:08.65]But I know when we're together
[02:11.50][02:36.00]
[02:36.33]I'll be around no matter what my baby
[02:41.92]And if I let you down
[02:44.91]I'll pick you up my baby
[02:47.89]I wanna be your everything
[02:50.85]And if you ever doubt my baby
[02:53.30]Then let this kiss be your evident
[02:58.92]That this was me
[03:01.50][04:00.00]
[04:00.28][03:01.80]I want this life, I want this love
[04:03.14][03:04.60]I want this kiss, I want this hug
[04:06.04][03:07.48]I want this time, I want this night
[04:09.02][03:10.49]I want you here by my side
[04:12.37][03:13.00]
