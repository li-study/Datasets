[00:03.00]Paradise Lost
[00:05.58]
[00:22.04]Across the desert sands I watch a caravan
[00:26.95]And dream it could take me to you
[00:31.41]As the east wind blows
[00:34.04]I shiver to my bones
[00:36.82]Cos all I can think of is you
[00:41.43]I still feel you here
[00:43.60]The memories so clear
[00:46.09]So don't go forgetting my love
[00:50.63]How we learned to be free
[00:53.08]How we dreamed the same dream
[00:55.65]Now nothing's what it seems
[01:00.58]Paradise lost is a place without you
[01:04.81]In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
[01:10.36]Walking alone on the sand
[01:13.72]Wish you were here again...
[01:23.31](I wish you were here again)
[01:34.11]I watch the sun go down and head back into town
[01:38.86]The same way I used to with you
[01:43.44]Up and down these streets
[01:45.82]The music sounds so sweet
[01:48.37]But it always reminds me of you
[01:53.41]I still feel you here
[01:55.61]The memories so clear
[01:58.04]So don't go forgetting my love
[02:02.48]How we learned to be free
[02:04.89]How we shared everything
[02:07.58]Until you come back to me
[02:12.61]Paradise lost is a place without you
[02:16.88]In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
[02:22.35]Walking alone on the sand
[02:25.74]Wish you were here again...
[02:33.70](do you remember)
[02:35.96]Do you remember
[02:42.10]Laying here with me
[02:45.45]Do you remember...
[02:50.89]The way we used to be...
[03:05.78]Paradise lost is a place without you
[03:09.82]In the shadow of love there's no room with a view
[03:15.11]Walking alone on the sand
[03:18.57]Wish you were here again... again
[03:28.03]I wish you were here again
[03:48.11]And tell me baby
[03:57.57]Do you remember
[04:07.20]Do you remember
[04:16.76]Do you remember
