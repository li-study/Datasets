[00:34.92]adapted by Frank Peterson, Sarah Brightman
[00:36.92]
[00:38.92]Take my hand
[00:41.20]I'm a stranger in paradise
[00:44.81]All lost in a wonderland
[00:48.70]A stranger in paradise
[00:52.04]If I stand starry-eyed
[00:55.78]That's the danger in paradise
[00:59.45]For mortals who stand beside an angel like you
[01:07.44]
[01:08.84]I saw your face ascending
[01:14.02]Out of the common place and into the rare
[01:21.07]Now somewhere out in space I hang suspended
[01:28.25]Until I'm certain that there's a chance that you care
[01:35.17]
[01:35.57]Won't you answer this fervent prayer
[01:39.01]Of a stranger in paradise
[01:42.56]Don't send me in dark despair
[01:46.40]From all that I hunger for
[01:49.96]But open your angel's arms
[01:53.66]To this stranger in paradise
[01:57.34]And tell him that he need be
[02:01.22]A stranger no more
[02:05.64]
[02:19.95]Aah-aah-aah
[02:32.98]
[02:34.12]Take my hand
[02:36.15]I'm a stranger in paradise
[02:39.88]All lost in a wonderland
[02:43.50]A stranger in paradise
[02:47.10]If I stand starry-eyed
[02:50.71]That's the danger in paradise
[02:54.40]For mortals who stand beside an angel like you
[03:02.09]
[03:03.91]I saw your face as I ascended
[03:09.03]Out of the common place and into the rare
[03:16.23]Now somewhere out in space I hang suspended
[03:23.53]Until I'm certain that there's a chance that you care
[03:30.66]
[03:31.03]Won't you answer this fervent prayer
[03:34.35]Of a stranger in paradise
[03:37.87]Don't send me in dark despair
[03:41.76]From all that I hunger for
[03:45.35]But open your angel's arms
[03:49.07]To this stranger in paradise
[03:52.73]And tell him that he need be
[03:56.59]A stranger no more
