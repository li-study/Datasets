[00:25.20]Mark :The sun went down so long ago
[00:28.03]I watched you cry i had to go
[00:31.04]Forever only lasted for a day
[00:37.13]And now without you by my side
[00:40.26]The visions of a lonely life
[00:42.77]Take me to a dream in a place so far away
[00:48.67]
[00:49.71]I see an angel and i think of you
[00:55.67]I watch you hide behind a smile
[01:01.47]And then i think of what i have to do
[01:08.44]If only i had listened for a while
[01:13.49]
[01:13.86]All: I still believe i still believe
[01:19.43]A love so strong will carry on
[01:23.46]You know theres so much to be seen

[01:32.01]Its not the end lets start again
[01:35.81]I still believe
[01:37.51]
[01:39.99]Mark: The emptiness of what could be
[01:42.28]Shows everything you mean to me
[01:45.68]It started out a game id never played
[01:51.58]If i defy the foolish pride
[01:54.75]And find that place so deep inside
[01:58.07]Take me to my dream i know i have to stay
[02:02.93]
[02:05.12]I see a rainbow and i think of you
[02:09.81]Of what we had of what we were
[02:15.76]And then i think of what i have to do
[02:22.60]If only i had listened for a while
[02:28.13]
[02:28.63]All: I still believe i still believe
[02:33.95]A love so strong will carry on

[02:54.88]Mark :Everybodys always asking me why
[02:59.54]Why i did what i did to make you cry
[03:04.86]Please believe me when i say what i say
[03:12.80]I didnt mean to go away
[03:17.98]At the time i couldnt stay
[03:19.18]
[03:44.94]I see an angel and she sees me too
[03:50.63]And as she wipes a teary eye
[03:57.13]I know exactly what i have to do
[04:02.38]To start a new beginning in my life
[04:06.27]
