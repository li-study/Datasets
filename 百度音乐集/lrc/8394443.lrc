[00:43.95]
[00:50.35]Welcome to the real world
[00:55.16]I said welcome to the real world
[00:57.92]Are we rushing like the wind ?
[01:00.26]Naked out and naked in

[01:51.67]Put your lovin' arms around
[01:57.66]Did you lose your faith in god, no ?
[02:03.68]Does your conscience always get you down ?
[02:08.54]Fall to pieces, rough and tumble
[02:13.83]Does your conscience always get you down ?
[02:18.85]These days it's all the mind
[02:23.65]It's elemental
[02:28.62]Don't say your up when your down
[02:33.38]It's elemental

[03:22.04]Put your lovin' arms around
[03:25.51]Take another leap in the dark
[03:29.32]With a humble heart
[03:31.91]Do yourself some good
[03:34.82]What did you become ?
[03:37.20]Patience, be sure
[03:40.23]Baby,baby
[03:47.72]These days it's all the mind
[03:52.20]It's elemental

[04:26.07]It's elemental
[04:33.43]These days it's all the mind
[04:36.91]It's elemental
[04:42.91]Don't say your up when your down
