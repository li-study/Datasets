[00:08.48]
[01:31.55]am I still alive?
[01:34.10]I think I've got it right.
[01:37.89]I'm, I'm made of light.
[01:43.24]Before I leave and go away,
[01:46.62]I have some things that I must say.
[01:50.67]Before I am gone.
[01:57.29]
[02:01.34]Finally now I see,
[02:04.30]there's so much inside of me.
[02:08.02]Is everyone innocent?
[02:13.43]The blood on the ground is almost dry
[02:16.41]I'll take this chance, I'll try...
[02:20.75]I'll try to tell you...
[02:26.34]
[02:27.50]There's so many possibilities,
[02:33.46]that I'm just starting to see.
[02:39.49]It's like the poets that have always said,
[02:45.46]when life is hanging from a thread...
[02:50.35]you can hear that voice in your head.
[03:21.81]
[03:27.46]And now my heart's done bleeding,
[03:33.48]but I've just started seeing.
[03:39.52]I feel my courage match the tide
[03:45.46]as I see the other side.
[03:50.00]When will we hear this voice all the time?
[04:55.42]
