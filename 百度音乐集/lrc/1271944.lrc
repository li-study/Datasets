[00:19.74]
[00:20.28]Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,
[00:22.45]Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
[00:25.41]I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
[00:28.70]Now let's go.
[00:29.78]Take 'em back to the plan...
[00:31.61]Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
[00:33.75]Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,
[00:35.81]Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
[00:38.25]Let's take 'em back to the club.
[00:40.59]Least about an hour I would stand on line,
[00:42.62]I just wanted to dance.
[00:43.74]I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
[00:45.96]I just wanted to shine.
[00:47.36]Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
[00:49.50]Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
[00:51.95]A hip hop legend.
[00:53.41]I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.
[00:56.23]
[00:57.14]I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
[01:00.45]For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
[01:04.47]Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
[01:09.89]For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
[01:13.42]
[01:14.06]Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
[01:20.73](Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)
[01:22.68]Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
[01:29.32](Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)
[01:32.08]
[01:32.38]Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,
[01:34.50]Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,
[01:36.84]I'd do anything to say "I got it".
[01:39.05]Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.
[01:41.30]Before anybody wanted K-West beats,
[01:43.49]Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.
[01:45.64]Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,
[01:48.15]Like "Damn, these niggas that much better than me?"
[01:50.34]Baby, I'm going on an airplane,
[01:52.75]And I don't know if I'll be back again.
[01:55.09]Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,
[01:56.97]But when she came to kick it, things became different.
[01:59.11]Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.
[02:01.41]I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.
[02:03.67]I'm trying to write my wrongs,
[02:05.78]But it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.
[02:08.17]Now,
[02:08.52]
[02:09.29]I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
[02:12.62]For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
[02:16.49](You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot
[02:19.82]Looking extra fly
[02:22.89]For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
[02:25.52]
[02:26.10]Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
[02:28.40]Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
[02:30.78]Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
[02:33.15]Peach fuzz buzz but bit on the verge
[02:35.29]Hold it down like we're on the serve
[02:37.51]Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.
[02:40.01]But, before you say another word,
[02:42.17]I'm back on the block like a man on the street.
[02:44.38]I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,
[02:46.25]But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
[02:48.24]Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthar,
[02:51.80]But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
[02:53.60]I come as correct as a porn star,
[02:55.07]In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
[02:57.70]So, I represent the first.
[02:59.88]Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like
[03:02.78]
[03:03.13]I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
[03:06.49]For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
[03:10.38](You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot
[03:14.41]Looking extra fly
[03:16.24]For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
[03:19.47]
[03:20.24](We back at home, baby)
[03:21.66]Sky high
[03:22.56]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:24.81]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:26.90]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:29.01]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:31.26]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:33.61]Sky, Sky high
[03:35.92]I'm, I'm sky high
[03:38.41]Yeah! (Keep it rollin)
[03:42.62](Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!)
[03:50.51]
