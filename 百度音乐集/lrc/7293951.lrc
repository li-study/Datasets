[00:44.31]
[00:46.31]Two weeks away
[00:47.19]It feels like the whole world should've changed
[00:49.44]But I'm home now
[00:51.51]And things still look the same
[00:53.84]I think I'll leave it to tomorrow till unpack
[00:56.76]Try to forget for one more night
[00:59.01]That I'm back in my flat on the road
[01:01.78]Where the cars never stop going through the night
[01:04.49]To A life where I can't watch sunset
[01:07.41]I don't have time
[01:11.23]I don't have time
[01:15.49]
[01:16.70]I've still got sand in my shoes
[01:20.68]And I can't shake the thought of you
[01:24.26]I shake it all, forget you
[01:28.13]Why, why would I want to
[01:31.92]I know we said goodbye
[01:35.32]Anything else would've been confused
[01:38.46]but I wanna see you again
[01:43.66]
[01:46.99]Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanitation
[01:50.05]run A baTH TO CLEAR UP THE MESS before I left here
[01:54.57]Try to REMIND MYSELF that I was happy here
[01:57.45]Before I knew that I could get on the plane and fly away
[02:01.39]From the road where the cars
[02:03.18]never stop going through the night
[02:05.21]To A life where I can watch the sunset
[02:08.17]And take my time,
[02:11.87]Take all our time
[02:16.17]
[02:17.44]I've still got sand in my shoes
[02:21.37]And I can't shake the thought of you
[02:24.99]I shake it all, forget you
[02:28.88]Why, why would I want to
[02:32.58]I know we said goodbye
[02:36.02]Anything else would've been confused
[02:39.23]but I wanna see you again
[02:47.13]I wanna see you again
[02:52.30]
[03:18.15]Two weeks away
[03:20.27]all it takes to change and turn me around I've fallen
[03:25.76]I walked away and never said that I wanted to see again
[04:05.53][03:35.30]I've still got sand in my shoes
[04:09.48][03:39.14]And I can't shake the thought of you
[04:13.33][03:42.75]I shake it all, forget you
[04:17.03][03:46.55]Why, why would I want to
[04:20.76][03:50.41]I know we said goodbye
[04:24.17][03:53.79]Anything else would've been confused
[04:27.39][03:57.07]but I wanna see you again
[04:32.69][04:02.44]
[04:35.17]I wanna see you again
[04:42.76]I wanna see you again
