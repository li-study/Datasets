[00:06.22]Nobody else here baby
[00:11.42]No one here to blame
[00:16.53]No one to point the finger
[00:20.96]It's just you and me and the rain
[00:26.35][01:52.04]It's the blind leading the blond
[00:31.92][02:55.90]It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs
[00:37.39][02:02.50][03:33.23]If God will send his angels
[00:42.23][02:07.56]And if God will send a sign
[00:47.47][02:13.01]And if God will send his visions
[00:52.29]Would everything be alright
[01:10.14]God has got his phone off the hook, babe
[01:14.39]Would he even pick up if he could
[01:20.51]It's been a while since we saw that child
[01:25.37]Hanging round this neighborhood
[01:30.48]You see his mother's dealing in a doorway
[01:35.66]See Father Christmas with a begging bowl
[01:41.83]Jesus sister's eyes are a blister
[01:46.95]The High Street never looked so low
[01:57.00]It's the cops collecting for the cons
[02:20.40][02:26.04]Where do we go
[02:35.18]Jesus never let me down
[02:40.24]You know Jesus used to show me the score
[02:45.55]Then they put Jesus in show business
[02:50.44]Now it's hard to get in the door
[03:00.71]But I guess it was something to go on
[03:06.41]So where is the hope and where is the faith
[03:11.42]And the love...what's that you say to me
[03:16.98]Does love...light up your Christmas Tree
[03:22.88]The next minute your blowing a fuse
[03:27.80]And the cartoon network turns into the news
[03:38.04]I sure could use them here right now
[03:43.12]Well if God would send his angels
[03:48.43]I don't need to lie
[03:51.78]I don't need to know
[03:53.83]And I don't want to promise
[03:55.95]And I don' t want to lie
[03:59.70]I just want to feel the song
