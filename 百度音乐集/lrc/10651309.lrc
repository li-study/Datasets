[00:05.55]Mire - Theatre of Tragedy
[00:12.50]
[01:27.30]Harken! - the clouds mustered in dark -
[01:41.77]So painfully easing.
[01:48.17]Hush! - hearest ye the yew doting;
[01:56.57]Its years of yore in a mire,
[02:05.63]Each like a corpse within its grave;
[02:14.40]Wrought for us a yearn of lief;
[02:23.64]
[02:30.27]Tis not a lore of bale nor loathe;
[02:37.84]Harmony and aesthesia are its blisses;
[02:45.33]Ne'er ere hath it exist'd so sonorously -
[02:52.85]Jostl'd away the pale drape
[02:57.28]That us had been o'erhung -
[03:00.42]
[03:04.60]Tempt'd thy shutters to open
[03:12.67]And thus quench'd the hearth;
[03:19.87]Thou giv'st to misery all thou hast: the cold -
[03:28.39]With weal embrac'd the sprounting landscape
[03:36.19]Like a star of heaven in the broad daylight -
[03:41.03]This joy subdueth until it again waneth,
[03:48.97]Save the drooping winter of stalwart.
