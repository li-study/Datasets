[00:02.52]Please, let me sit down beside you
[00:14.56]I've got something to tell you, you should know
[00:23.92]I just couldn't wait for not another day
[00:33.62]I love you, for more than words can ever say
[00:43.58]
[00:44.68]Honey living without you is so painful
[00:56.18]I was tempted to call it a day
[01:04.64]You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand
[01:14.64]I love you baby, for more than words can say
[01:24.18]
[01:25.65]I just can't sleep, when I lay down in my bed
[01:35.99]The thoughts of you babe, just linger in my head
[01:46.61]Living without you is so painful.
[01:58.10]I was tempted to call it a day
[02:07.21]You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand
[02:17.50]I love you honey, for more than words can say
[02:27.58]
