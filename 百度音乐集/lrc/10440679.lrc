[00:00.91]Where Do We Go From Here
[00:03.88]Alicia Keys
[00:08.70]
[00:43.86]We're at the crossroads, my dear
[00:51.26]Where do we go from here?
[01:04.14]Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
[01:10.79]Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
[01:21.46]It's such a lonely road
[01:25.66]Where do we go from here?
[01:31.59]All I can do is - follow the tracks of my tears
[01:43.36]Oh
[01:44.67]When I cry your name
[01:47.16]Am I crawling in bed
[01:51.62]Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
[02:03.76]Oh
[02:04.70]Don't you do it
[02:07.64]No, said don't you leave me this way
[02:12.11]I don't know
[02:16.02]If I can lift my head and face another day
[02:22.75]Ooh it's such a lonely road
[02:25.25]Where do we go from here?
[02:33.12]All I can do is - follow the tracks of my tears
[02:42.63]You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
[02:51.72](Who could this be? Staring at me)
[02:55.73]When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
[03:00.58](Me too far gone, to find my way home)
[03:05.43]Where do we go from here?
[03:13.75]All I can do is - follow the tracks of my tears
[03:25.72]Where do we go from here?
[03:34.06]All I can do is - follow the tracks of my tears
