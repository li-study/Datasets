[00:08.15]Nicholas:
[00:09.09]All your eyes have ever seen
[00:13.42]All you've ever heard
[00:17.46]Is etched upon my memory
[00:21.71]I spoken through my words
[00:25.71]
[00:26.47]All that I take with me
[00:30.78]Is all you've left behind
[00:35.04]Were sharing one eternity
[00:39.67]Living in two minds
[00:45.09]Linked by an endless thread
[00:50.83]Impossible to break
