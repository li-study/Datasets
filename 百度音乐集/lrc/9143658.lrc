[00:03.40]Let Her Down Easy
[00:04.45]Ronan Keating
[00:05.39]Turn It On
[00:06.19]
[00:08.20]You're top man on the scene
[00:10.57]You don't think life comes in between
[00:14.25]But hey, she's just seventeen
[00:22.80]She feels that she's a worldly girl
[00:26.72]But man you've been around the world
[00:31.15]She is just some worried daddy's girl
[00:40.78]Even though there's nothing i can say
[00:44.69]To cheat you and nature any way
[00:47.71]
[00:48.20]Let her down easy
[00:51.26]Her heart is on a dime
[00:56.24]Let her down easy
[00:59.57]And you'll grow up in time
[01:01.16]
[01:04.32]In her strawberry eyes
[01:07.39]The way she sees you signifies
[01:11.03]That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
[01:19.82]But if you must lay her down
[01:24.14]May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
[01:27.69]And please do not lead her on when you leave town
[01:37.64]Even though there's nothing i can say
[01:41.56]To cheat you and nature any way
[01:43.71]
[01:45.13]Let her down easy
[01:48.24]Her heart is on the line
[01:53.30]Let her down easy
[01:57.34]And you'll grow up in time
[01:59.36]
[02:02.04]She's a woman now
[02:05.00]With a daughter to make her proud
[02:08.38]In her crayon world of paper clouds
[02:16.86]She still remembers you
[02:20.43]The first boy that she gave it to
[02:25.60]And she laughs at how little then she knew
[02:40.06]Even though there's nothing I can say
[02:42.23]Let her down easy
[02:45.26]Her heart is on the line
[02:50.30]Let her down easy
[02:53.23]And you'll grow up in time
