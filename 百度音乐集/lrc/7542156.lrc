[00:00.15]You're solid, yeah
[00:04.23]Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
[00:08.00]
[00:09.96]Saw the signs in your eyes
[00:12.39]What was up wasn't right
[00:15.09]And none of us was innocent
[00:17.96]Baby, still we played our games
[00:21.58]Scared to win,
[00:22.84]Left the mess we were in
[00:24.87]On uneven ground,
[00:27.99]Lost what we found
[00:30.35]
[00:30.62]I had to put away my pride
[00:32.87]To find a way that I could love you more
[00:37.52]I couldn't keep away from you
[00:40.43]Then you walk back in my life
[00:42.76]And all at once we were just like before
[00:47.61]No one does what you can do
[00:50.01]
[00:50.42]You're solid, yeah
[00:53.98]Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
[00:57.22]Boy, your love goes on and on
[00:59.74]You're solid, yeah
[01:03.90]You and I thought that our thrill was gone
[01:07.16]You were solid than a rock
[01:09.79]
[01:14.99]Like a cool summer breeze
[01:17.09]You're the fan for the heat
[01:19.61]I feel lying next to you natur..ally
[01:25.06]There's a switch in my heart
[01:27.00]Only you can turn it on
[01:29.51]You're the flame that lights late at night
[01:32.66]Deep inside me
[01:34.92]
[01:35.95]For so long I tried to fight
[01:37.62]The way I felt the way you made me fall
[01:42.26]But I couldn't keep away from you
[01:45.06]But then you walk back in my life
[01:47.50]And all at once we were just like before
[01:52.66]'Cos no one knows what you can do
[01:54.81]

[02:15.15]Surrender, when you do the things you do
[02:19.54]Together, I cant get enough of you
[02:24.28]
[02:24.88]You're the missing piece
[02:27.29]The other half of me
[02:29.47]To make me complete
[02:34.08]
[02:34.35]You're solid, yeah
