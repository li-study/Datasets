[00:04.47]Bruno Mars
[00:07.13]
[00:17.24]Truth of the matter is i'm complicated
[00:21.05]You're as straight as they come
[00:24.49]You go about your day baby
[00:27.97]While i hide from the sun
[00:31.37]It's better if you don't understand
[00:37.25]Cos you won't know what it's like until you try
[00:41.76]
[00:44.18]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other side
[00:50.95]And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
[00:58.29]I could wait a whole life time
[01:01.74]But you just got to decide
[01:04.96]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other
[01:10.32]Waiting on the other side
[01:12.46]
[01:12.93]We would live forever
[01:15.76]Who could ask for more
[01:19.47]You could die if you wanted
[01:23.16]But baby what for?
[01:26.44]It's better if you don't understand
[01:32.07]And you won't know what it's like til you try
[01:37.09]
[01:39.07]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other side
[01:46.17]And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
[01:53.13]I could wait a whole life time
[01:56.45]But you just got to decide
[01:59.57]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other
[02:05.09]Waiting on the other side
[02:06.77]
[02:07.47]Cos they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
[02:10.61]Cos this ain't wonderland, it damn sure ain't narnia
[02:14.05]And once you cross the line
[02:15.85]You can't change your mind
[02:17.74]Yeah i'm a monster but i'm no frankenstein
[02:20.75]And quite frankly i've been feeling insane in between my eyes
[02:23.99]I really can't explain what i feel inside
[02:25.59]If you know what i was you'd run and hide
[02:27.40]Maybe if you try to go into the night
[02:29.02]And cross over the line
[02:30.77]And come back alive
[02:31.86]But that's the price we pay
[02:32.23]And when we living on the other side
[02:34.15]
[02:34.33]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other side
[02:40.87]And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
[02:47.99]I could wait a whole life time
[02:51.87]But you just got to decide
[02:54.56]You know i, i'll be waiting on the other
[03:00.09]Waiting on the other side
[03:01.94]
[03:07.01]It's better if you don't understand
[03:14.13]It's better if you don't understand (ooh ooh ah)
[03:21.02]It's better if you don't understand (ooh ooh ah)
[03:27.77]It's better if you don't understand (ooh ooh ah)
[03:34.64]It's better if you don't understand (ooh ooh ah)
[03:41.14]It's better if you don't understand
