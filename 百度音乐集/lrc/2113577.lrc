[00:11.61]He drove a short distance, then proceeded to stop the car.
[00:24.17]He said, This is all I can take you.
[00:35.08]So I got off the car, and right away a girl hopped in,
[00:44.55]and they drove very far.
[00:48.76]Nearly broke my heart, yes it did.
[00:54.26]Nearly broke my heart.
[00:58.25]
[00:58.99]So I suppose it doesn't matter what we say anyway.
[01:05.51]And even if we did even if we did
[01:12.87]love in that way,
[01:17.93]nothing will be changed.
[01:23.67]
[01:35.56]I sat on the dirt road and watched it split in two.
[01:47.91]The shop clerk, he told me roads never meet again.
[01:58.62]So I kicked a few stones and watched them roll.
[02:06.18]'Should I hitch a ride?' I asked aloud to myself.
[02:12.51]I fear waiting here by myself. I fear going nowhere.
[02:22.14]
[02:23.10]So I suppose it doesn't matter what we say anyway.
[02:29.11]And even if we did even if we did
[02:36.28]love in that way,
[02:42.26]nothing will be changed.
[02:47.20]
[02:59.50]What is this feeling?
[03:06.28]I do not like it all.
[03:12.25]But no one is here
[03:18.50]to watch me file complaints.
[03:22.41]
[03:23.21]So I shrugged at the wind, biting and harsh.
[03:30.61]Well, what can you do? I thought very hard,
[03:36.66]though it wasn't a question at all.
[03:42.04]No answer from my mouth.
[03:46.37]
[03:47.11]So I suppose it doesn't matter what we say anyway.
[03:53.20]And even if we did even if we did
[04:00.98]love in that way,
[04:06.22]nothing will be changed
[04:10.53]
[04:11.31]So I suppose it doesn't matter what we say anyway.
[04:17.01]And even if we did even if we did
[04:24.62]love in that way,
[04:30.28]nothing will be changed
[04:39.87]
