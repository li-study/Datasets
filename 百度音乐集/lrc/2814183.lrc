[00:-2.00]Lily Allen - 22
[00:-1.00]

[00:04.40]
[00:05.06]When she was 22 the future looked bright
[00:11.67]But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
[00:19.73]I see that look in her face she's got that look in her eye
[00:26.39]She's thinking how did I get here and wondering why
[00:33.12]
[00:34.18]It's sad but it's true how society says her life is already over
[00:41.42]There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
[00:48.41]Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
[00:56.07]It seems so unlikely in this day and age
[01:00.69]
[01:03.56]She's got an alright job but it's not a career
[01:10.80]Wherever she thinks about it, it brings her to tears
[01:17.56]Cause all she wants is a boyfriend she gets one-night stands
[01:24.87]She's thinking how did I get here I'm doing all that I can
[01:31.76]
[01:32.80]It's sad but it's true how society says her life is already over
[01:39.92]There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
[01:47.10]Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
[01:54.78]It seems so unlikely in this day and age
[01:59.83]
[02:16.71]It's sad but it's true how society says her life is already over
[02:24.00]There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
[02:31.04]Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
[02:38.62]It seems so unlikely in this day and age
