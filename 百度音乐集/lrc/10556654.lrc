[00:08.50]
[00:18.97]I'm standing on a bridge
[00:21.09]I'm waiting in the dark
[00:23.53]I thought that you'd be here by now
[00:28.05]There's nothing but the rain
[00:30.43]No footsteps on the ground
[00:32.71]I'm listening but there's no sound
[00:38.10]Isn't anyone trying to find me?
[00:42.55]Won't somebody come take me home
[00:46.37]It's a damn cold night
[00:51.04]Trying to figure out this life
[00:55.78]Won't you take me by the hand
[00:58.19]Take me somewhere new
[01:00.71]I dont know who you are
[01:03.49]But I... I'm with you
[01:09.08]I'm with you
[01:15.33]I'm looking for a place
[01:17.66]Searching for a face
[01:19.94]Is anybody here I know
[01:24.58]Cause nothing's going right
[01:27.02]And everything's a mess
[01:29.51]And no one likes to be alone
[01:34.66]Isn't anyone trying to find me?
[01:39.23]Won't somebody come take me home
[01:42.83]It's a damn cold night
[01:47.57]Trying to figure out this life
[01:52.17]Won't you take me by the hand
[01:54.66]Take me somewhere new
[01:57.34]I dont know who you are
[01:59.88]But I... I'm with you
[02:06.49]I'm with you
[02:11.35]Oh why is everything so confusing
[02:16.83]Maybe I'm just out of my mind
[02:20.92]Yea yea yea ...
[02:30.47]It's a damn cold night
[02:34.79]Trying to figure out this life
[02:39.43]Won't you take me by the hand
[02:42.16]Take me somewhere new
[02:44.45]I dont know who you are
[02:47.01]But I... I'm with you
[02:53.68]I'm with you
[02:59.51]Take me by the hand
[03:00.78]Take me somewhere new
[03:03.25]I don't know who you are
[03:05.88]But I... I'm with you
[03:12.38]I'm with you
[03:18.34]Take me by the hand
[03:19.77]Take me somewhere new
[03:22.34]I don't know who you are
[03:24.79]But I... I'm with you
