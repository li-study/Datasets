[00:04.86]Title: Bessie Smith
[00:10.16]Bessie was more than a friend of mine
[00:16.73]We shared the good times and the bad
[00:23.46]Well many years has since passed me by
[00:30.55]I still recall the best thing I ever had
[00:36.33]Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie
[00:44.82]Oh see her soon
[00:50.06]I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
[00:56.63]When I get there I wondering what she'll do
[01:07.70]Now all the crazy things I had to try
[01:14.35]Well I tried them all and then some
[01:21.34]But if you're lucky one day you will find out
[01:28.52]Where it is that you're really coming from
[01:33.68]Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie
[01:42.43]Oh see her soon
[01:47.86]I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
[01:54.60]When I get there I wondering what she'll do
[02:56.39]Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
[03:03.66]But back then I didn't worry about a thing
[03:10.57]Now and again I still wonder to myself
[03:17.22]Was it the sweet love or the way that she could sing
[03:22.38]I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
[03:36.64]When I get there I wondering what she'll do
[03:42.77]I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
[03:43.65]When I get there I wondering what she'll do
