[00:09.00]They asked me how I knew my true love was true. Oh,
[00:23.00]I of course replied
[00:27.00]"something here inside cannot be denied."
[00:42.00]They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind."
[00:52.00]Oh,When your heart's on fire,
[01:01.00]you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
[01:17.00]So I chaffed them
[01:21.00]and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love.
[01:33.00]Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love.
[01:50.00]Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide. Oh,
[02:04.00]So I smile and say
[02:09.00]"when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes!"
[02:24.00][02:20.00]Smoke gets in your eyes
[02:34.00]
