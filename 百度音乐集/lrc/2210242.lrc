[00:02.12]Animal Nitrate
[00:24.11]Like his dad you know that he's had
[00:29.56]Animal nitrate in mind,
[00:33.60]Oh in your council home he jumped on your bones
[00:38.70]Now you're taking it time after time
[00:42.78]Oh it turns you on, on, now he has gone
[00:52.21]Oh what turns you on now your animal's gone?
[01:02.47]Well he said he'd show you his bed
[01:06.70]And the delights of the chemical smile,
[01:11.55]So in your broken home he broke all your bones
[01:16.35]Now you're taking it time after time
[01:20.77]Oh it turns you on, on, now he has gone
[01:30.26]Oh what turns you on now your animal's gone?
[02:02.20]What does it take to turn you on, on,
[02:09.03]Now he has gone?
[02:11.64]Now you're over 21?
[02:17.97]Now your animal's gone?
[02:21.74]...animal, he was animal, an animal.
