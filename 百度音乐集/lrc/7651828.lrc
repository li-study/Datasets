[00:03.00]
[00:07.89]When you're down and you're out
[00:12.76]And you don't think you have a friend
[00:17.02]When you're lost in the doubt
[00:21.50]And you can't see what's around the bend
[01:31.74][00:25.91]Just hold on
[01:34.07][00:27.66]Don't turn around
[01:36.16][00:29.84]Keep on walking
[01:38.36][00:31.90]Don't lose heart
[01:40.48][00:34.14]'Cause I am here, I am here
[01:44.66][00:38.23]Wherever you are, wherever you are
[02:55.68][01:49.30][00:42.94]When the rain is falling
[02:57.78][01:51.45][00:44.86]And there's no silver lining
[02:59.77][01:53.40][00:46.93]And you just can't seem to find the light
[03:03.85][01:57.48][00:51.08]When you need a reason
[03:06.10][01:59.79][00:53.46]To help, you keep believing
[03:08.20][02:02.01][00:55.51]Let my love be your blue sky
[01:14.48]Don't you know that I know
[01:16.91]Life can be so hard it makes you wanna give up
[01:23.57]But don't you know over the horizon
[01:26.70]The sunny day you're looking for
[01:28.73]Is waiting right here in my love
[03:37.62][03:28.59][02:48.19][02:39.70][02:31.16][02:22.03]Come on, come on
[03:39.30][03:30.76][02:49.87][02:41.43][02:32.91][02:24.34]Don't you be afraid
[03:41.40][03:33.03][02:52.12][02:43.52][02:35.06][02:26.43]Whatever comes tomorrow
[03:43.44][03:35.01][02:54.17][02:45.53][02:37.02][02:28.51]My love is here to stay
