[00:14.32]
[00:22.75]Saying "I love you"
[00:26.96]Is not the words I want to hear from you
[00:32.81]It's not that I want you
[00:36.86]Not to say, but if you only knew
[00:42.29]How easy it would be to show me how you feel
[00:49.65]More than words
[00:55.93]Is all you have to do to make it real
[01:06.66]Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me yeah
[01:10.89]'Cause I'd already know
[01:15.98]
[01:16.37]What would you do, if my heart was torn in two?
[01:25.23]More than words to show you feel
[01:29.70]That your love for me is real
[01:43.89]What would you say if I took those words away?
[01:44.73]Then you couldn't make things new
[01:48.62]Just by saying "I love you"
[02:00.38]
[02:13.48]Now that I've tried to talk to you
[02:18.82]And make you understand
[02:23.27]All you have to do is close your eyes
[02:29.97]And just reach out your hands
[02:32.47]And touch me
[02:37.14]Hold me close, don't ever let me go
[02:41.82]More than words
[02:44.99]Is all you ever needed me to show
[02:51.03]Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me yeah
[02:58.99]'Cause I'd already know
