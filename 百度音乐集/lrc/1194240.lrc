[00:06.00]我们相爱一年了，OH，YEAH
[00:16.09]It\'s one hundred and nine degrees in this crowded room
[00:22.02]No room to breathe with walls as cold as a gallery
[00:29.38]This is no place for me
[00:31.54]Such hard faces in smoke
[00:34.61]The smell lingers in my clothes
[00:39.51]It\'s a bad night to be alone
[00:45.11]But thats the way it goes
[00:48.13]And I think of you whenever life gets me down
[00:55.88]I think of you whenever you\'re not around
[01:03.19]And you rest your bones
[01:10.83]Somewhere far from my house
[01:18.27]Yeah, but you still pull me home
[01:24.36]
[01:27.18]I thought I had it figured out in a brand new life with a great big house
[01:35.22]And green initials on the towels
[01:40.68]I should be happy now
[01:42.20]Well, you got yourself a family
[01:47.04]And you planted roots down by the sea
[01:50.96]I saw you once on the street
[01:55.86]You didn\'t notice me
[01:57.86]But I think of you whenever life gets me down
[02:05.85]I think of you (I think of you) whenever you\'re not around
[02:13.14]You rest your bones
[02:21.00]Somewhere far from my house
[02:28.40]Yeah, but you still pull me home
[02:34.72]不管人生多么艰险，我都愿与你同行，我的爱只为你
[02:54.48]Just to put your mind at ease
[02:58.17]You don\'t owe me anything
[03:01.82]You paid me well in memories
[03:05.99]
[03:09.45]And I think of you (I think of you) whenever life gets me down
[03:17.49]I think of you (I think of you) whenever you\'re not around
[03:25.01]And you rest your bones
[03:32.47]Somewhere far from my house
[03:39.92]Yeah, but you still pull me home
[03:47.51]You still pull me home
[03:57.39]You still pull me home
[04:00.80]
