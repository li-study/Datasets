[03:09.50][02:03.50][01:13.50][00:23.50]Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
[03:14.50][02:08.50][01:18.50][00:28.50]Make him express how he feels and maybe
[03:18.50][02:11.50][01:22.50][00:32.50]Then you'll know your love is real

[00:53.50]What you need is a big strong hand to
[00:57.50]Life you to your higher ground
[01:01.50]Make you feel like a queen on a throne
[01:04.50]Make him love you till you can't come down
[01:26.50]Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
[01:30.50]He needs to start with your head
[01:34.50]Satin sheets are very romantic
[01:38.50]What happens when you're not in bed
[01:43.50]You deserve the best in life

[01:51.50]Second best is never enough
[01:54.50]You'll do much better baby on your own, baby on your own
[03:55.50][03:38.50][03:21.50][02:15.50]Express yourself
[03:23.50][02:16.50]You've got to make him
[03:25.50][02:19.50]Express himself
[03:27.50][02:20.50]Hey, hey, hey, hey
[03:46.50][03:29.50][02:23.50]So if you want it right now, make him show you how
[03:51.50][03:34.50][02:28.50]Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
[02:33.50]And when you're gone he might regret it
[02:38.50]Think about the love he once had
[02:41.50]Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
[02:46.50]He'll be back on his knees to express himself
[02:51.50]You've got to make him express himself, hey hey
