[00:40.75]The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes
[00:46.87]
[00:47.10]And they said that in our time,
[00:52.08]All that's good will fall from grace
[00:55.28]Even saints would turn their face,
[00:57.53]In our time
[00:58.67]
[00:59.28]And they told us that in our days,
[01:04.04]Different words said in different ways,
[01:07.57]Have other meaning from he who says,
[01:09.98]In our time.

[01:39.31]
[01:39.61]And they said that in our time,
[01:44.75]We would reap from their legacy,
[01:47.84]We would learn from what they had seen,
[01:50.13]In our time.
[01:51.39]
[01:51.91]And they told us that in our days,
[01:57.02]We would know what was high on high,
[02:00.20]We would follow and not defy,
[02:02.36]In our time.
[02:03.72]
[02:07.77]Give us this day all that you showed me,

[02:26.08]The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes
[02:50.58]
[03:15.69]Give me all the story book told me,
[03:21.81]The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes
[03:27.31]Give us this day all that you showed me,
[03:28.16]Give us this day all that you showed me,
[03:33.70]The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
[03:34.32]The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
[03:39.64]Give me all the story book told me,
[03:40.03]
[03:45.47]The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes
[03:52.40]Give us this day all that you showed me,
[03:59.16]The power and the glory 'til thy kingdom come
[04:05.35]Give me all the story book told me,
[04:12.49]The faith and the glory 'til thy kingdom comes
