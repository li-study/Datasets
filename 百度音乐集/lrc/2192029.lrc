[00:19.87]wake me up
[00:21.73]only nightmares take me in
[00:26.99]through these walls the winter bites
[00:31.11]a draft from all sides
[00:35.14]why did you not include me on your list?
[00:49.00]let me in through the ceiling
[00:57.09]white lips kissed
[01:01.51]our love is a fickle love
[01:07.18]keeps itself locked in a suitecase
[01:14.93]to be ready to go
[01:19.42]always
[01:27.46]i won’t cry when the silver lining shows
[01:34.25]but you’re right
[01:37.01]you understand
[01:38.99]you ride with both hands
[01:42.96]worrying is the breathing that you need
[01:50.35]so there won’t be far to fall
[01:54.44]you mustn’t climb tall
[02:12.37]things that are supposed to mean lots
[02:18.15]leave you cold
[02:21.99]and with a malady of the soul
[02:33.67]our love is a tricky love
[02:40.58]bet you know this
[02:44.42]bet you noticed
[02:48.59]bet you know, wich is why
[02:59.17]i should know better than anyone ever could
[03:14.23]soon as i let go
[03:22.20]everything falls apart
[03:33.49]i won’t cry when the silver lining shows
[03:41.17]but you’re right
[03:42.72]you understand
[03:44.82]you ride with both hands
[03:49.03]worrying is the breathing that you need
[03:56.39]so there won’t be far to fall
[04:00.46]you mustn’t climb tall
