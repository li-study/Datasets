[00:02.00]Snow Patrol
[00:04.00]
[00:20.50]It seems the day that your house burned to the ground
[00:25.33]
[00:29.29]Was the day that you'd always planned to leave anyway
[00:34.04]
[00:38.20]And the vast empire you come through to get here
[00:42.23]
[00:46.31]Makes the world look like pennies in my hand
[00:50.70]
[00:55.34]I'll never let go
[00:57.40]I'll never let go you said out loud
[01:00.08]
[01:03.98]I'll never let go
[01:06.08]I'll never let go you shouted out
[01:08.55]
[01:12.39]Your words shook me right out of a daydream
[01:16.87]
[01:21.10]I was lost somewhere cold and it looked haunted
[01:25.71]
[01:29.86]I was asking strangers but no one understood me
[01:34.53]
[01:38.38]I was drenched in sweat when your words came to me
[01:42.61]
[01:47.33]I'll never let go
[01:49.40]I'll never let go you said out loud
[01:52.15]
[01:55.99]I'll never let go
[01:57.99]I'll never let go you shouted out
[02:00.66]
[02:04.35]wo...wowo ..
[02:21.80]It was the last highway you would ever travel
[02:25.82]
[02:30.40]The long road from a daughter, wife and son
[02:34.49]
[02:38.95]When the bus stopped a beat from California
[02:44.14]
[02:47.64]Your tired feet they ached over the road
[02:51.87]
[02:56.49]I'll never let go
[02:58.50]I'll never let go you said out loud
[03:01.71]
[03:05.03]I'll never let go
[03:07.24]I'll never let go you shouted out
[03:09.99]
[03:13.69]I'll never let go
[03:15.84]I'll never let go you said out loud
[03:18.89]
[03:22.32]I'll never let go
[03:24.50]I'll never let go you shouted out
[03:27.15]
[03:31.04]wo...wowo ..
