[00:01.44]Soledad
[03:45.41][00:05.45]
[00:18.29]If only you could see the tears
[00:22.70]In the world you left behind
[00:26.05]If only you could heal my heart
[00:30.68]Just one more time
[00:34.40]Even when I close my eyes
[00:38.78]There's an image of your face
[00:42.02]And once again I come to realise
[00:46.72]You're a loss I can't replace
[02:48.56][01:54.51][00:52.47]Soledad
[03:14.72][02:50.66][01:56.64][00:54.55]It's a keeping for the lonely
[03:18.69][02:54.64][02:00.54][00:58.48]Since the day that you were gone
[03:22.48][02:58.50][02:04.44][01:02.23]Why did you leave me
[03:24.58][03:00.05][02:06.57][01:05.14]Soledad
[03:26.93][03:02.70][02:08.60][01:06.58]In my heart you were the only
[03:30.69][03:06.71][02:12.61][01:10.57]And your memory lives on
[03:34.44][03:10.43][02:16.36][01:14.30]Why did you leave me
[03:36.24][03:12.12][02:18.61][01:16.47]Soledad
[01:20.47]Walking down the streets
[01:22.87]Of Nothingville
[01:24.78]Where our love was young and free
[01:28.31]Can't believe just what an empty place
[01:32.63]It has come to be
[01:35.38]I would give my life away
[01:40.58]If it could only be the same
[01:44.12]Cause I can't still the voice inside of me
[01:48.84]That is calling out your name
[02:23.22]Time will never change the things you told me
[02:31.24]After all we're meant to be
[02:35.28]Love will bring us back to you and me
[02:43.16]If only you could see
