[00:01.50]Wham!
[00:06.50]A Different Corner
[00:13.50][00:10.50]
[00:18.50]I'd say love was a magical thing
[00:23.50]I'd say love would keep us from pain
[00:27.50]Had I been there
[00:32.50]had I been there
[00:35.50]
[00:38.50]I would promise you all of my life
[00:42.50]But to lose you would cut like a knife
[00:47.50]So I don't dare
[00:51.50]no I don't dare
[00:55.50]
[00:56.50]'Cause I've never come close
[00:59.50]in all of these years
[01:01.50]You are the only one to stop my tears
[01:06.50]And I'm so scared
[01:10.50]I'm so scared
[01:46.50][01:37.50][01:30.50][01:26.50][01:18.50][01:13.50]
[01:54.50]Take me back in time maybe I can forget
[01:58.50]Turn a different corner and we never would have met
[02:08.50]Would you care
[02:05.50]
[02:13.50]I don't understand it
[02:15.50]for you it's a breeze
[02:17.50]Little by little
[02:20.50]you've brought me
[02:22.50]to my knees
[02:29.50]Don't you care
[03:32.50][03:29.50]
[02:31.50]No I've never come close in all of these years
[02:36.50]You are the only one to stop my tears
[02:42.50]I'm so scared
[02:46.50]of this love
[03:46.50][02:48.50][03:03.50][03:13.50][03:19.50]
[02:50.50]And if all that there is is this fear of being used
[02:56.50]I should go back to being lonely and confused
[03:04.50]If I could
[03:07.50]I would
[03:21.50][03:10.50]I swear
