[00:00.00]Tori Amos - A Sorta Fairytale
[00:10.88]
[00:12.88]On my way up north
[00:17.40]Up on the Ventura
[00:20.21]I pulled back the hood
[00:23.63]And I was talking to you
[00:25.82]And I knew then it would be
[00:29.63]A Life Long thing
[00:31.36]But I didn't know that we
[00:35.97]We could break a silver lining
[03:50.95][01:33.77][00:41.00]And I'm so sad
[03:54.71][01:37.60][00:44.67]Like a good book
[03:56.28][01:39.28][00:46.19]I can't put this
[03:58.03][01:41.14][00:48.11]Day Back
[04:01.08][01:44.16][00:51.26]A sorta fairytale with you
[04:04.50][01:47.58][00:54.56]A sorta fairytale with you
[04:07.63][01:50.56][00:57.43]A sorta fairytale with you
[01:01.20]
[01:05.72]Things you said that day
[01:10.30]Up on the 101
[01:12.28]The girl had come undone
[01:16.50]I tried to downplay it
[01:18.41]With a bet about us
[01:22.78]You said that-
[01:23.67]You'd take it
[01:25.41]As long as I could
[01:28.98]I could not erase it
[01:55.39]
[01:59.00]And I ride along side
[02:02.13]And I rode along side
[02:04.30]You then
[02:05.25]And I rode along side
[02:07.89]Till you lost me there
[02:09.84]In the open road
[02:11.46]And I rode along side
[02:14.57]Till the honey spread
[02:16.12]Itself so thin
[02:17.53]For me to break your bread
[02:20.53]For me to take your word
[02:23.71]I had to steal it
[02:26.78]
[02:29.92]And I'm so sad
[02:33.70]Like a good book
[02:35.28]I can't put this
[02:37.16]Day Back
[02:40.11]A sorta fairytale with you
[02:43.59]A sorta fairytale with you
[02:45.61]I could pick back up
[02:47.52]Whenever I feel
[02:52.13]
[02:55.95]Down New Mexico way
[02:59.25]Something about the open road
[03:02.15]I knew that he was
[03:04.72]Looking for some Indian Blood and
[03:08.50]Find a little in you find a little
[03:11.40]In me we may be
[03:14.14]On this road but
[03:17.63]We're just Imposters
[03:19.46]In this country you know
[03:22.93]So we go along and we said
[03:25.46]We'd fake it
[03:26.93]Feel better with Oliver Stone
[03:29.37]Till I almost smacked him
[03:31.03]Seemed right that night and
[03:33.21]I don't know what takes hold
[03:35.82]Out there in the Desert cold
[03:39.37]These guys think they must
[03:42.31]Try and just get over on us
[03:45.72]
[04:15.86]And I was ridin' by
[04:20.20]Ridin' along side
[04:24.91]For a while till you lost me
[04:28.25]And I was ridin' by
[04:32.64]Ridin' along till you lost me
[04:37.48]Till you lost me in The Rear View
[04:45.56]You lost me I said
[04:53.81]Way up North I took my day
[04:56.98]All in all was a pretty nice
[04:59.28]Day and I put the Hood
[05:01.49]Right back where
[05:03.70]You could taste heaven perfectly
[05:06.70]Feel out the summer breeze
[05:09.36]Didn't know when we'd be back
[05:11.95]And I, I don't
[05:14.07]Didn't think
[05:15.46]We'd end up like
[05:17.95]Like this
[05:22.55]
