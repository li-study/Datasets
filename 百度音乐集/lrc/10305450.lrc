[00:02.10]Title: Wonderful World
[00:02.73]I've been down so low
[00:05.11]people look at me and they know,
[00:08.17]they can tell something is wrong
[00:11.45]like I dont belong,
[00:14.41]well, staring through a window
[00:16.91]standing outside there
[00:18.74]just to happy to care
[00:20.29]and I wana be like them
[00:23.27]but I'll mess it up again,
[00:27.16]I tripped them out
[00:27.89]when God kicked outside everybody's soul.
[00:32.28]
[00:32.72]And I know that it's a wonderful world
[00:34.75]But i cant feel it right now,
[00:38.46]when I thought I was doing well
[00:40.92]but I just want to cry now,
[00:44.53]Well I know that its a wonderful world
[00:47.63]from the sky down to the sea,
[00:50.50]but I can only see when you're here,
[00:54.25]here with me.
[00:57.41]
[00:59.07]Sometimes I feel so full
[01:01.47]that it just comes spilling out,
[01:04.75]it's uncomfortable to see
[01:07.18]I give it away so easily,
[01:11.45]but if I had someone I would do anything
[01:14.64]and never never never
[01:16.75]neverlet you feel alone
[01:17.76]I wont, I wont leave u on your own,
[01:23.38]who am I to dream,
[01:25.08]dreams are for fools,
[01:26.58]they always let you down.
[01:28.16]
[01:28.52]And I know that it's a wonderful world
[01:30.96]But I cant feel it right now,
[01:34.52]I thought i was doing well
[01:37.13]but I just want to cry now,
[01:40.59]Well I know that its a wonderful world
[01:43.67]from the sky down to the sea,
[01:46.60]but I can only see when you're here,
[01:50.10]here with me.
[01:53.22]
[01:57.85]And I wish that I could make it better,
[02:00.49]I'd give anything for you to call me,
[02:05.50]Maybe just a little letter
[02:08.33]Oh it could start again.
[02:17.23]
[02:18.93]And I know that it's a wonderful world
[02:21.20]But I cant feel it right now,
[02:24.82]I thought I was doing well
[02:27.32]but I just want to cry now,
[02:30.75]Well I know that its a wonderful world
[02:33.79]from the sky down to the sea,
[02:36.90]but I can only see when you're here,
[02:40.49]here with me.
[02:43.12]
[02:44.49]I know that its a wonderful world
[02:47.14]but I cant feel it right now,
[02:50.52]Iv got all the right clothes to wear
[02:53.31]i just wana cry now,
