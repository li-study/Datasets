[00:01.83]Quiet Times
[00:03.95]Dido
[00:05.87]
[00:08.74]You ask me where I go tonight,
[00:10.62]I'll go back to today last year
[00:17.47]When me and you had to make
[00:18.79]each other happy and there
[00:20.71]was hope with everything
[00:26.18]It's hard enough to feel
[00:27.58]the world as it is and hold on anything
[00:31.34]
[00:34.14]Without these quiet times,
[00:37.73]you've bought round here
[00:39.80]
[00:43.59]I'm gonna have to run away
[00:45.33]I'm sure that I belong some other place
[00:52.10]I've seen another side of all
[00:54.32]I've seen it keeps me wondâ€™rin'
[00:56.63]where my family is,
[01:01.04]It's hard enough to see
[01:02.30]the world as it and hold on anything
[01:06.03]
[01:08.99]Without these quiet times,
[01:13.24]comin' round here
[01:16.76]
[01:18.13]And I miss you,
[01:21.72]And I want you,
[01:26.18]But I can't have you
[01:30.72]Even when you're here
[01:32.84]
[01:35.66]I suppose I have to take you with me
[01:38.07]broken mind I'd rather leave you here
[01:44.47]To forget everything
[01:46.10]you've seen and known here as every idea
[01:50.73]
[01:53.08]When you walk up in the street
[01:57.68]and hold my hand and smile
[02:01.79]But I won't be takin' it, '
[02:06.08]cause I know how it turns out
[02:09.15]and it takes me back
[02:12.40]To these quiet times,
[02:13.83]comin' round here
[02:18.45]
[02:19.51]And I miss you,
[02:23.89]And I want you,
[02:27.73]You're not comin' back,
[02:32.55]And I need you,
[02:36.41]But I can't have you,
[02:40.58]even when you're here
[02:42.58]
[02:45.56]And I miss you,
[02:50.00]And I want you,
[02:53.57]You're not comin' back,
[02:58.77]And I need you,
[03:02.58]But I can't have you,
[03:06.73]even when you're here
[03:09.36]
