[00:01.01]Sarah McLachlan - U Want Me 2
[00:11.03]
[00:14.06]You walk on by
[00:19.26]Clueless and so high
[00:24.77]Following your aimless path away from us
[00:36.60]You're so far away
[00:41.88]And what can I say
[00:46.89]Cause I can't be the one
[00:50.44]you wanted me to be
[00:54.89]So tell me how do you feel
[00:58.32]It's so confusing
[01:00.72]If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
[01:05.03]Do you want me to stay and
[01:08.57]ay I still want you
[01:12.14]You want me too, don't you
[01:17.69]
[01:27.39]So what are we saying
[01:32.64]Our eden's a failure
[01:37.90]A made-up story to fit
[01:42.06]the picture-perfect world
[01:47.71]The one with "I do"s
[01:51.77]and I love you
[01:56.21]And we are made for each other
[02:01.65]Is forever over now
[02:05.99]
[02:06.86]And tell me how do you feel
[02:10.41]It's so confusing
[02:12.38]If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
[02:16.94]Do you want me to stay and
[02:19.97]say I still want you
[02:23.60]You want me too, don't you
[02:28.55]
[02:49.28]I hope there's forgiveness
[02:53.96]In the distance between us
[02:57.71]Can we make what lies ahead
[03:03.30]of us a better place to be
[03:07.74]So tell me, how do you feel
[03:11.60]It's so confusing
[03:13.66]If you let it all go, it'll fall
[03:18.16]Do you want me to stay and
[03:21.99]say I still want you
[03:24.88]You want me too, don't you
[03:30.10]
