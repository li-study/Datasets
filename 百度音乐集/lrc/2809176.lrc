[00:02.75]Civil Twilight - Letters from the sky
[00:14.49]
[00:23.21]One of these days the sky's gonna break and everything will escape and I'll know
[00:35.92]One of these days the mountains are gonna fall into the sea and they'll know
[00:48.76]That you and I were made for this
[00:51.84]I was made to taste your kiss
[00:54.98]We were made to never fall away
[01:07.75]Never fall away
[01:12.18]
[01:22.31]One of these days letters are gonna fall from the sky telling us all to go free
[01:34.78]But until that day I'll find a way to let everybody know that you're coming back, you're coming back for me
[01:47.81]'Cause even though you left me here I have nothing left to fear
[01:54.05]These are only walls that hold me here
[02:07.87]Hold me here, hold me here
[02:36.86]
[02:47.06]One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
[02:58.11]And we will hear those planes overhead and we won't have to be scared
[03:20.60]We won't have to be, we won't have to be scared
[03:40.27]
[03:48.35]You're coming back for me
[03:49.98]You're coming back for me
[03:51.23]
[04:09.48]You're coming back to me
[04:16.35]
[04:19.51]Chab; ) Enjoy this beautiful song
