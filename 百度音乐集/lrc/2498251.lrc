[00:00.00]All The Beautiful Girls--Keren Ann
[00:10.00]
[00:21.22]All the beautiful girls
[00:24.76]They wanna stay late
[00:27.16]And finish the wine
[00:29.76]In your luxury basement
[00:33.05]They swing in velvet and pearls
[00:37.52]And like to debate
[00:39.74]Pollock and kline,
[00:42.50]Ginsberg and korsow
[00:47.42]With a slight foreign accent
[00:50.89]You drip the paint from a can
[00:54.89]And abundantly blush and invisible sun
[01:02.06]But instead of a brush
[01:04.82]You wish you had a gun
[01:08.34]
[01:10.06]If they leave you alone with your misery
[01:22.02]Deep in the fire of your fame
[01:32.43]You'll be begging them blind
[01:37.46]Give me love, give me love
[01:43.61]Of every kind
[01:47.44]
[01:53.88]All the beautiful girls
[01:58.10]They wanna stay late
[02:00.44]They never complain
[02:03.03]As they lean on my back
[02:06.50]They walk-in with fancy hellos
[02:10.93]To greet the unknown
[02:12.89]And redecorate
[02:15.92]My second hand wardrobe
[02:21.11]With a fashionable smack
[02:24.15]I sip the rest of the wine
[02:27.91]While i hear them repeat
[02:31.07]What upsets me the most
[02:35.97]That instead of a man, i married a ghost
[02:42.36]
[02:44.09]If i leave you alone with your misery
[02:54.99]Deep in the fire of your fame
[03:06.00]You'll be begging me blind
[03:11.08]Give me love, give me love
[03:16.96]Of every kind
[03:21.82]
