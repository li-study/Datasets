[00:23.27]When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
[00:27.27]And whispered in my ear, guess who
[00:31.53]I rattled off names like I really didn’t know
[00:35.81]But all along I knew it was you
[00:38.75]
[00:39.65]And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
[00:43.94]And wondered why we didn’t last
[00:47.84]It had been a long time, but later last night
[00:51.78]Baby, we caught up real fast
[00:54.67]
[00:56.74]And maybe it’s a little too early
[01:00.21]To know if this is gonna work
[01:04.85]All I know is you’re sure looking
[01:09.00]Good in my shirt
[01:11.94]That’s right
[01:12.83]
[01:19.83]You look good in my shirt
[01:21.47]
[01:29.01]Well now I’m not saying that we solved overnight
[01:33.24]Every way that we went wrong
[01:37.23]Oh, but what I’m seeing I’d sure love seeing
[01:41.44]Every morning from now on
[01:45.38]
[01:46.12]And maybe it’s a little too early
[01:49.68]To know if this is gonna work
[01:54.19]All I know is you’re sure looking
[01:58.59]Good in my shirt
[02:00.61]
[02:01.46]C’mon now
[02:04.96]Aww that’s right
[02:08.41]Oh you look so fine
[02:10.06]
[02:19.01]And maybe it’s a little too early
[02:22.58]To know if this is gonna work
[02:27.10]All I know is you’re sure looking
[02:30.77]Good in my shirt
[02:32.84]
[02:35.29]And maybe it’s a little too early
[02:38.86]To know if this is gonna work
[02:43.39]All I know is you’re sure looking
[02:47.58]Good in my shirt
[02:51.58]You look good in my shirt
