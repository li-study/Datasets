[00:21.32]She's got a lip ring and 5 colours in her hair,
[00:26.15]Not into fashion but I love the clothes she wears,
[00:31.02]Her tattoo's always hidden by her underwear.
[00:35.07]She don't care.
[00:37.33]
[00:38.13]Everybody wants to know her name,
[00:42.86]I threw a house party and she came
[00:47.86]Everyone asked me
[00:50.14]Who the hell is she?
[00:52.48]That weirdo with 5 colours in her hair.
[00:56.36]
[00:57.93]She's just a loner with a sexy attitude,
[01:02.80]I'd like to phone her if she puts me in the mood.

[01:38.96]She was all I thought about,
[01:40.67]The girl I couldn't live without.
[01:44.10]But then she went insane,
[01:48.08]She couldn't take the fame
[01:53.06]She said I was to blame
[01:57.26]She'd had enough
[01:59.61]And shaved five colours off
[02:02.73]And now she's just a weirdo with no name.
[02:09.48]
[02:20.01]Everybody wants to know her name.

[02:34.48]That weirdo with 5 colours in her hair.
