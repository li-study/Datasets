[05:04.15][00:58.57]Three hours from sundown
[05:08.31][01:04.12]Jeremy flies
[05:14.90][01:09.08]Hoping to keep
[05:18.69][01:13.54]The sun from his eyes
[05:24.94][01:19.04]East from the city
[05:29.30][01:23.73]And down to the cave
[05:35.54][01:28.88]In search of a master
[05:40.08][01:33.10]In search of a slave.
[01:55.57]Three hours from London
[02:01.02]Jacomo's free
[02:06.23]Taking his woes
[02:10.42]Down to the sea
[02:16.32]In search of a lifetime
[02:20.42]To tell when he's home
[02:26.56]In search of a story
[02:30.58]That's never been known.
[03:16.25]Three hours from speaking
[03:21.02]Everyone's flown
[03:26.90]Not wanting to be
[03:31.78]Seen on their own
[03:37.71]Three hours is needed
[03:42.95]To leave from them all
[03:48.68]Three hours to wonder
[03:54.55]And three hours to fall.
