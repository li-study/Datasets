[00:13.32]I came to tell you
[00:17.90]How we've all began
[00:23.67]Nothing seems to work out right
[00:28.12]I'm broken down again
[00:33.63]So hold me now
[00:36.42]And say it's not forever
[00:43.47]Maybe someday
[00:48.68]In time
[00:51.85]
[00:52.72]Things will go my way
[01:03.12]Things will go my way
[01:07.18]I've pushed to get through
[01:12.08]The crowds in twisted zone
[01:17.48]Just to find I'm right back here
[01:21.98]Doing what I'm told
[01:27.15]So take my hand
[01:30.05]Don't let me surrender
[01:36.68]'Cuz maybe someday
[01:42.08]Yeah, in time
[01:44.90]
[01:46.04]Things will go my way
[02:07.43][01:56.75]Things will go my way
[02:10.36]For all the lives I've tasted
[02:12.93]Just looking for the truth
[02:15.27]For all the dreams I'm chasing
[02:17.91]What am I to do
[02:20.66]With everything against me
[02:23.35]The answers are all wrong
[02:26.17]Open now, I'll find out
[02:28.70]It was working all along
[02:31.71]So hold me now
[02:34.26]And say it's not forever
[02:41.45]'Cus I know someday
[02:46.43]In time
[02:50.64]Things will go my way
[03:00.95]Things will go my way
[03:11.65]Things will go my way
[03:15.06]For all the things I've tasted
[03:17.18]Just looking for the truth
[03:19.56]For all the dreams I'm chasing
[03:22.33]What am I to do
[03:25.06]With everything against me
[03:27.80]The answers are all wrong
