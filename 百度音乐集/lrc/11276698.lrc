[00:26.85]As far as my eyes can see
[00:35.20]There are shadows approaching me
[00:43.72]And to those I left behind
[00:48.45]I wanted you to know
[00:52.68]Youve always shared my deepest thoughts
[00:56.97]You follow where I go
[01:01.70]And oh when Im old and wise
[01:10.71]Bitter words mean little to me
[01:14.83]Autumn winds will blow right through me
[01:18.59]And someday in the mist of time
[01:27.79]When they asked me if I knew you
[01:31.50]Id smile and say you were a friend of mine
[01:36.98]And the sadness would be lifted from my eyes
[01:45.33]Oh when Im old and wise
[01:52.52]As far as my eyes can see
[02:01.16]There are shadows surrounding me
[02:09.68]And to those I leave behind
[02:14.60]I want you all to know
[02:18.53]Youve always shared my darkest hours
[02:22.71]Ill miss you when I go
[02:26.96]And oh, when Im old and wise
[02:36.52]Heavy words that tossed and blew me
[02:40.54]Like autumn winds that will blow right through me
[02:44.27]And someday in the mist of time
[02:53.42]When they ask you if you knew me
[02:56.83]Remember that you were a frined of mine
[03:02.61]As the final curtain falls before my eyes
[03:11.21]Oh when Im old and wise
[03:18.27]As far as my eyes can see
