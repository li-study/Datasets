[00:01.12]Anastacia - All Fall Down
[00:03.13]
[00:07.55]No one's born in this world without a soul
[00:14.66]Some will follow every single road trying to find a home
[00:22.00]But when you're sheltered by the ones you love
[00:25.95]You can stand protected from harm
[00:29.56]
[00:29.73]In your life don't ever let me fall
[00:36.92]Cos sometimes I think I'm falling,
[00:39.98]like a burning satellite
[00:44.10]You Sacrifice, it doesn't matter who you are
[00:51.05]We all fall down
[00:53.80]
[00:58.95]We were moving slowly pass the point of no return
[01:06.68]Silence is a deadly poison when you have no words
[01:13.55]And we can but the pieces back together
[01:17.82]Find a way to make things right (yeah yeah)
[01:21.56]
[01:21.74]In your life don't ever let me fall
[01:28.60]Cos sometimes I think I'm falling,
[01:31.85]like a burning satellite
[01:35.78]You Sacrifice, it doesn't matter who you are
[01:41.84]We all fall down
[01:43.79]
[01:43.97]Don't stop believing in what you're feeling
[01:51.69]We all fall down
[01:58.74]
[02:17.14]In your life don't ever let me fall
[02:23.95]Cos sometimes I think I'm falling,
[02:27.44]like a burning satellite
[02:31.52]In my eyes you'll always be the shining star
[02:37.04]Through the trials and tribulations,
[02:42.70]I will know that you're the one
[02:56.83]
