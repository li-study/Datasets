[00:00.54]Night swimming, beach walking ~"Saints and Sinners" - "Black Coffee"~
[00:02.35]Always silent, never talking
[00:04.38]Then you call my name
[00:06.01]And I know inside I love you
[00:08.41]Sail away I miss you more
[00:10.36]Until you see the shore
[00:12.44]There I will be waiting, anticipating

[00:50.55]I wouldn't wanna take
[00:52.32]Everything out on you

[01:18.41]I remain the same
[01:20.09]Did I tell you that I love you?
[01:22.35]Brush you teeth, pour a cup of black coffee out
[01:26.08]I love to watch you do that every day
