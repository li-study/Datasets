[00:07.00]Title: Broken Promises
[00:14.55]The day you left me
[00:17.11]there was a feeling I have never shown
[00:20.07]The day you told me
[00:22.09]there were the words that I have never known
[00:25.48]And now it's over
[00:27.88]So what's left that I should ever feel
[00:30.73]cause since the day you left me I have been so alone
[00:36.09]And now we're left with broken promises
[00:42.56]my heart can't take no more
[00:47.11]and now we're left with broken promises
[00:53.56]my mind has had enough
[01:00.95]Deep inside me
[01:03.70]there are things that I have never told
[01:06.69]they burn inside me
[01:08.68]and now I need to know
[01:10.85]Why are you trying to take everything away from me
[01:12.50]well I'm begging you
[01:14.90]I'm here with nothing left to show
[01:17.37]cause since the day you left me I have been so alone
[01:22.79]And now we're left with broken promises
[01:29.00]my heart can't take no more
[01:34.03]And now we're left with broken promises
[01:39.93]my mind has had enough
[01:55.80]Look at how you turned on me
[01:57.69]You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
[02:00.09]I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
[02:02.91]Don't you think I've got something to say
[02:06.63]Look at how you turned on me
[02:08.41]You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
[02:11.07]I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
[02:13.96]Don't you think I've got something to say
[02:15.97]Now look at how you turned on me
[02:19.42]You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
[02:22.11]I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
[02:24.86]Don't you think I've got something to say
[02:28.51]And now we're left with broken promises
[02:34.86]my heart can't take no more
[02:40.03]and now we're left with broken promises
[02:45.91]my mind has had enough
[02:50.97]and now we're left with broken promises
[02:56.87]my heart can't take no more
[03:01.96]and now we're left with broken promises
[03:07.88]my mind has had enough
