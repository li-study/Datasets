[00:00.00]She's got her halo and wings
[00:03.90]Hidden under his eyes
[00:06.86]But she's an angel for sure
[00:10.06]She just can't stop telling lies
[00:13.24]But it's too late for his love
[00:16.51]Already caught in a trap
[00:19.68]His angel's kiss was a joke
[00:22.94]And she is not coming back
[00:25.69]
[00:26.05]Because heaven sends and heaven takes
[00:29.80]Crashing cars in his brain
[00:32.91]Keep him tied up to a dream
[00:36.08]And only she can set him free
[00:38.94]And then he says to me
[00:40.66]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[00:47.15]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[00:51.19]Yeah...
[00:51.71]
[00:52.00]She's got a criminal mind
[00:55.12]He's got a reason to pray
[00:58.32]His life is under the gun
[01:01.58]He's got to hold every day
[01:04.80]Now he just wants to wake up
[01:08.01]Yeah, just to prove it's a dream
[01:11.24]Cause she's an angel for sure
[01:14.43]But that remains to be seen
[01:17.23]
[01:17.47]Because heaven sends and heaven takes
[01:21.32]Crashing cars in his brain
[01:24.57]Keep him tied up to a dream
[01:27.60]And only she can set him free
[01:30.40]And then he says to me
[01:32.19]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[01:38.34]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[01:42.27]
[01:44.71]Stupid on the streets of London
[01:47.94]James Dean in the rain
[01:51.92]Without her...it's not the same
[01:57.85]The same, the same, but it's alright
[02:02.03]
[02:02.68]Because heaven sends and heaven takes
[02:06.49]Crashing cars in his brain
[02:09.69]Keep him tied up to a dream
[02:12.68]And only she can set him free
[02:15.48]And then he says to me
[02:17.33]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[02:23.73]Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[02:28.64]Again and again
[02:29.90]
