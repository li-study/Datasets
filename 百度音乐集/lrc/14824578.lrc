[00:02.12]Paul McCartney
[00:03.32]
[00:11.98]When I find myself in times of trouble
[00:15.84]Mother Mary comes to me
[00:19.53]Speaking words of wisdom
[00:22.24]Let it be
[00:23.36]
[00:26.05]And in my hour of darkness
[00:28.76]She is standing right in front of me
[00:33.00]Speaking words of wisdom
[00:35.69]Let it be
[00:36.99]
[00:38.60]Let it be, let it be
[00:42.70]Let it be, let it be
[00:46.08]Whisper words of wisdom
[00:49.33]Let it be
[00:50.85]
[00:53.53]And when the broken-hearted people
[00:57.04]Living in the world agree
[01:00.41]There will be an answer
[01:03.14]Let it be
[01:04.68]
[01:06.43]For though they may be parted
[01:09.77]There is still a chance that they will see
[01:14.08]There will be an answer
[01:17.24]Let it be
[01:18.36]
[01:19.71]Let it be, let it be
[01:23.58]Let it be, let it be
[01:27.11]There will be an answer
[01:30.44]Let it be
[01:32.02]
[01:33.05]Let it be, let it be
[01:37.29]Let it be, let it be
[01:41.60]Whisper words of wisdom
[01:44.42]Let it be
[01:47.84]
[02:28.72]Let it be, let it be
[02:32.13]Let it be, let it be
[02:36.31]Whisper words of wisdom
[02:39.28]Let it be
[02:41.24]
[02:43.31]And when the night is cloudy
[02:46.00]There is still a light that shined on me
[02:50.09]Shine until tomorrow
[02:53.05]Let it be
[02:54.38]
[02:56.55]I wake up to the sound of music
[03:00.43]Mother Mary comes to me
[03:03.78]Speaking words of wisdom
[03:06.65]Let it be
[03:09.23]
[03:09.94]Let it be, let it be
[03:13.29]Let it be, let it be
[03:16.78]There will be an answer
[03:20.34]Let it be
[03:21.75]
[03:22.79]Let it be, let it be
[03:26.87]Let it be, let it be
[03:31.65]Whisper words of wisdom
[03:34.10]Let it be
[03:36.41]
[03:43.28]Let it be
[03:48.42]
