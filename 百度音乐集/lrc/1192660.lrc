[00:22.00]You think that we connect
[00:24.00]That the chemistry's correct
[00:28.00]Your words walk right through my ears
[00:31.00]Presuming I like what I hear
[00:35.00]And I'm stuck in the web
[00:39.00]You're spinning
[00:42.00]You've got me for your prey...
[02:35.00][01:29.00][00:45.00]Sorry, I'm not home right now
[03:53.00][03:46.00][02:38.00][01:31.00][00:47.00]I'm walking into spiderwebs
[03:55.00][03:49.00][02:39.00][01:32.00][00:48.00]So leave a message
[03:57.00][03:50.00][02:40.00][01:33.00][00:50.00]And I'll call you back
[02:42.00][01:35.00][00:51.00]A likely story, but leave a message
[02:46.00][01:39.00][00:56.00]And I'll call you back
[01:05.00]You take advantage of what's mine
[01:08.00]You're taking up my time
[01:11.00]Don't have the courage inside me
[01:15.00]To tell you please just let me be
[01:19.00]Communication, telephonic invasion
[01:25.00]I'm planning my escape...
[03:17.00][02:49.00][01:42.00]And it's all your fault
[03:20.00][02:52.00][01:45.00]I screen my phone calls
[03:23.00][02:56.00][01:49.00]No matter who calls
[03:26.00][02:59.00][01:52.00]I gotta screen my phone calls
[02:09.00]Now it's gone too deep
[02:15.00]You wake me in my sleep
[02:22.00]My dreams become nightmares
[02:28.00]'Cause you're ringing in my ears
