[00:00.64]Dead By Sunrise - Too Late
[00:01.53]
[00:12.60]It's cold and dark I think I'm going insane
[00:18.09]The end is coming it's true
[00:23.88]I'm all alone and I am screaming your name
[00:29.65]It seems that's all I can do
[00:33.71]
[00:34.51]But it's too late to turn back now
[00:40.61]It's too loud to hear a sound
[00:46.59]I'm so lost I can't be found
[00:51.88]It's too late to turn back now
[00:58.55]
[01:01.71]It's hard to focus when your life is a blur
[01:07.66]It's hard to see the truth
[01:13.32]How can I move on when there's so much to learn
[01:19.18]And every road comes back to you
[01:23.43]
[01:23.98]But it's too late to turn back now
[01:30.05]It's too loud to hear a sound
[01:35.92]I'm so lost I can't be found
[01:41.74]It's too late to turn back now
[01:48.11]
[02:07.89]But it's too late to turn back now
[02:13.65]It's too loud to hear a sound
[02:19.41]I'm so lost I can't be found
[02:25.28]It's too late to turn back now
[02:32.50]
[02:40.16]I'm so lost I can't be found
[02:45.80]It's too late to turn back now
