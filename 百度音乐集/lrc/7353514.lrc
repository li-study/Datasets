[00:00.02]The Best Is Yet To Come
[00:02.06]演唱：AT17
[00:05.08]
[00:11.37]永远有一个吻未尝
[00:13.91]有些烛光未燃亮
[00:16.94]若爱太苦要落糖
[00:19.72]结它断线亦无恙
[00:22.81]To hug someone to kiss someone
[00:28.54]The best is yet to come
[00:33.57]若要错失永不能守
[00:36.54]得到也不代表长久
[00:39.28]假使快乐有尽头
[00:41.08]痛苦也未会不朽
[00:44.80]寂寞半点假如不能承受
[00:47.52]这生命注定过得不易
[00:51.57]笑与泪 亦有时候
[00:57.03]To hug someone to kiss someone
[01:02.17]The best is yet to come
[01:06.98]
[01:18.00]若你说不再听情歌
[01:21.71]不想再经历这漩涡
[01:24.64]假使抱住你拳头
[01:26.45]到底也没法牵手
[01:30.07]就是为了追求一时平静
[01:33.08]将感情隔离半点感动都扼杀
[01:38.46]没法承受
[01:42.11]永远有不妥协伤口
[01:44.46]有些憾事不放手
[01:47.00]若你太刻意淡忘
[01:49.95]越会补不到缺口
[01:54.35]Why don't you just hug soneone
[01:59.14]just kiss someone
[02:01.76]The best is yet to come
[02:07.08]最好的尚未来临
[02:13.98]
