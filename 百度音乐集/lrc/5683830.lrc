[00:01.12]Jonas Brothers - That's Just The Way We Roll
[00:07.47]
[00:12.84]I woke up on my roof with my brothers
[00:18.98]There's a whale in the pool with my mother
[00:25.29]And my dad paints the house different colors
[00:32.18]Where would we be if we couldn't dream?
[00:37.92]
[00:38.23]And I know we get a little crazy
[00:41.39]And I know we get a little loud
[00:44.55]And I know we're never gonna fake it
[00:47.78]We are wild, we are free
[00:49.32]We are more than you think
[00:51.55]So call us freaks
[00:52.84]But that's just the way we roll
[00:55.66]
[01:00.56]You've got moves, I've got shoes
[01:03.72]Let's go dancing
[01:06.88]Pop-and-lock
[01:08.64]Battle dance against Hanson
[01:13.41]If we lose
[01:14.96]All the girls, they'll be laughing
[01:20.16]Where would we be if we couldn't dream?
[01:26.19]
[01:26.45]And I know we get a little crazy
[01:29.37]And I know we get a little loud
[01:32.60]And I know we're never gonna fake it
[01:35.75]We are wild, we are free
[01:37.31]We are more than you think
[01:39.31]So call us freaks
[01:40.79]But that's just the way we roll
[01:42.60]
[01:42.79]Cause we're old enough to know
[01:45.40]We're never letting go
[01:50.37]Cause that's just the way we roll
[02:08.23][01:51.96]
[02:08.40][01:52.15]And I know we get a little crazy
[02:10.92][01:55.12]And I know we get a little loud
[02:14.13][01:58.14]And I know we're never gonna fake it
[02:17.33][02:01.33]We are wild, we are free
[02:18.94][02:02.89]We are more than you think
[02:21.04][02:04.90]So call us freaks
[02:22.33][02:06.42]But that's just the way we roll
[02:28.40]
[02:29.02]That's just the way we roll
[02:33.83]Oh, that's just the way we roll
[02:45.69]
