[00:00.00]Chris Isaak - Blue Christmas
[00:03.23]I'll have a blue Christmas without you
[00:11.78]I'll be so blue just thinking about you
[00:20.02]Decorations of red
[00:23.70]On a green Christmas tree
[00:28.81]Won't mean a thing if
[00:32.30]If you're not here with me.
[00:34.53]
[00:35.00]And the wind knows blue snow flakes start falling
[00:43.69]When those blue blue memories start calling
[00:51.62]You'll be doing all right
[00:56.13]With your Christmas of white
[01:00.01]Oh but I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[01:05.29]
[01:23.74]You'll be doing all right
[01:27.78]With your Christmas of white
[01:31.91]Oh but I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[01:38.37]
[01:39.85]And when you needn't pray on this Christmas day
[01:48.11]Remember I have a blue blue Christmas
[01:55.13]Remember I have a blue blue Christmas
