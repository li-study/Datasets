[00:13.00]
[00:14.00]Go to sleep, may your sweet dreams come true
[00:19.00]Just lay back in my arms for one more night
[00:25.00]I've this crazy old notion that calls me sometimes
[00:32.00]Saying this one's the love of our lives.
[00:38.00]Cause I know a love that will never grow old
[00:51.00]And I know a love that will never grow old.
[01:05.00]When you wake up the world may have changed
[01:10.00]But trust in me, I'll never falter or fail
[01:16.00]Just the smile in your eyes, it can light up the night,
[01:23.00]And your laughter's like wind in my sails.
[01:29.00]Cause I know a love that will never grow old
[01:42.00]And I know a love that will never grow old.
[02:22.00]Lean on me, let our hearts beat in time,
[02:26.00]Feel strength from the hands that have held you so long.
[02:33.00]Who cares where we go on this rutted old road
[02:39.00]In a world that may say that we're wrong.
[02:46.00]Cause I know a love that will never grow old
[02:59.00]And I know a love that will never grow old.
