[00:09.00]
[00:10.31]Well I left for work in a hurry
[00:15.14]I rushed out the door without saying goodbye
[00:19.31]I didn't tell her I loved her this mornin'
[00:23.09]But I'll tell her tonight
[00:25.33]
[00:26.82]I thought to myself and as I hurried off towards the highway
[00:33.97]This truck outta nowhere caught me by surprise
[00:38.57]He missed me by inches an my life passed in front of my eyes
[00:45.97]I guess that's the reason that they say
[00:50.43]
[00:51.00]Dance every dance an live each day'
[00:55.67]As though it's your last
[00:57.47]An tell those that you love how you feel
[01:01.55]Before it's too late
[01:07.82]Life is right here and now
[01:10.11]We only go around just one time
[01:16.56]So embrace'em and don't waste'em
[01:19.45]For these are the days of our lives
[01:24.64]
[01:31.39]Well as soon as my legs stopped a shakin'
[01:36.59]Took a deep breath an turned my car around
[01:41.16]Oh,I'm gonna take that vacation
[01:44.77]That we talked about
[01:46.75]
[01:48.42]startin' right now although I know tomorrow will be here
[01:55.63] tomorrow will not always be here for me
[02:00.31]'Cause nothin' in life is for certain but death's guaranteed
[02:07.73]And that's the reason that I say
[02:12.00]
[02:12.67]Dance every dance an live each day
[02:17.23]As though it's your last
[02:18.92]An tell those that you love how you feel
[02:23.19]Before it's too late
[02:29.41]Life is right here and now
[02:31.63]We only go around just one time
[02:38.06]So embrace'em and don't waste'em
[02:40.80]For these are the days of our lives
[02:47.74]
