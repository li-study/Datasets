[00:-4.50]Forgotten
[00:-3.50]Linkin Park
[00:-2.50]
[00:-0.50]From the top to the bottom
[00:01.75]Bottom to top I stop
[00:02.69]At the core I've forgotten
[00:03.84]In the middle of my thoughts
[00:04.87]Taken far from my safety
[00:06.10]The picture is there
[00:07.10]The memory won't escape me
[00:08.33]But why should I care
[00:09.41]From the top to the bottom
[00:10.58]Bottom to top I stop
[00:11.60]At the core I've forgotten
[00:12.79]In the middle of my thoughts
[00:13.79]Taken far from my safety
[00:15.00]The picture is there
[00:16.09]The memory won't escape me
[00:17.25]But why should I care
[00:18.42]There's a place so dark you can't see the end
[00:20.41](Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
[00:22.45]The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
[00:24.10]Forcefully, the power of suggestion
[00:26.83]Then with the eyes tightly shut looking thought the rust and rot
[00:29.54]And dust a spot of light floods the floor
[00:31.62]And pours over the rusted world of pretend
[00:33.75]The eyes ease open and it's dark again
[00:35.86]From the top to the bottom
[00:37.42]Bottom to top I stop
[00:38.27]At the core I've forgotten
[00:39.31]In the middle of my thoughts
[00:40.29]Taken far from my safety
[00:41.54]The picture is there
[00:42.54]The memory won't escape me
[00:44.02]But why should I care
[00:45.35]In the memory you'll find me
[00:50.10]Eyes burning up
[00:54.01]The darkness holding me tightly
[00:58.59]Until the sun rises up
[01:03.55]
[01:06.26]Moving all around screaming of the ups and downs
[01:09.46]Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
[01:11.52]The wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the
[01:14.16]Street lamps, chain-link and concrete
[01:16.04]A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats
[01:18.11]On down the street till the wind is gone
[01:20.25]The memory now is like the picture was then
[01:22.54]When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again
[01:24.72]From the top to the bottom
[01:25.83]Bottom to top I stop
[01:26.90]At the core I've forgotten
[01:28.19]In the middle of my thoughts
[01:29.20]Taken far from my safety
[01:30.38]The picture is there
[01:31.39]The memory won't escape me
[01:32.60]But why should I care
[01:33.70]From the top to the bottom
[01:34.86]Bottom to top I stop
[01:35.82]At the core I've forgotten
[01:37.00]In the middle of my thoughts
[01:38.02]Taken far from my safety
[01:39.21]The picture is there
[01:40.21]The memory won't escape me
[01:41.46]But why should I care
[01:43.07]In the memory you'll find me
[01:47.94]Eyes burning up
[01:51.83]The darkness holding me tightly
[01:56.25]Until the sun rises up
[02:01.00]
[02:04.88]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:06.20]You bring the thought back
[02:07.17]I'm telling you that
[02:08.22]I see it right through you
[02:09.31]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:10.35]You bring the thought back
[02:11.40]I'm telling you that
[02:12.55]I see it right through you
[02:13.89]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:15.03]You bring the thought back
[02:16.04]I'm telling you that
[02:16.97]I see it right through you
[02:18.17]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:19.35]You bring the thought back
[02:20.30]I'm telling you that
[02:21.34]I see it right through you
[02:22.41]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:23.66]You bring the thought back
[02:25.02]I'm telling you that
[02:25.80]I see it right through you
[02:27.06]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:28.31]You bring the thought back
[02:29.36]I'm telling you that
[02:30.28]I see it right through you
[02:31.47]Now you got me caught in the act
[02:32.64]You bring the thought back
[02:33.75]I'm telling you that
[02:34.67]I see it right through you
[02:36.20]In the memory you'll find me
[02:41.10]Eyes burning up
[02:45.03]The darkness holding me tightly
[02:49.41]Until the sun rises up
[02:54.10]In the memory you'll find me
[02:58.47]Eyes burning up
[03:02.77]The darkness holding me tightly
[03:07.19]Until the sun rises up
[03:13.10]
