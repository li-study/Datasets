[00:15.75]We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
[00:20.93]Wishing our families well
[00:24.20]We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
[00:29.41]But not for the missing
[00:31.63]So this one's for all the lost children
[00:36.17]This one's for all the lost children
[00:40.30]This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
[00:48.59]And wishing them home
[00:51.08]
[01:06.74]When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
[01:12.36]Biding your time
[01:15.23]When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
[01:20.87]Because I'm keeping a place
[01:23.77]For all the lost children
[01:27.44]This is for all the lost children
[01:31.62]This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
[01:39.97]And wishing them home
[01:42.72]
[01:49.86]Home with their fathers,
[01:52.92]Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
[01:57.33]I see the door simply wide open
[02:01.62]But no one can find thee
[02:05.87]So pray for all the lost children
[02:10.17]Let's pray for all the lost children
[02:14.48]Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
[02:23.06]This is for all the lost children
[02:27.27]This one's for all the lost children
[02:31.57]Just think of all the lost children
[02:35.94]Wishing them well, and wishing them home
[02:43.50]
