[00:03.70]All things bright and beautiful,
[00:15.84]All creatures great and small,
[00:20.11]All things wise and wonderful:
[00:24.38]The Lord God made them all.
[00:27.56]
[00:28.54]Each little flowâ€™r that opens,
[00:32.04]Each little bird that sings,
[00:35.86]He made their glowing colors,
[00:40.24]He made their tiny wings.
[00:43.85]
[00:44.62]All things bright and beautiful,
[00:48.44]All creatures great and small,
[00:52.50]All things wise and wonderful:
[00:56.32]The Lord God made them all.
[01:03.87]
[01:04.96]The purple-headed mountains,
[01:09.34]The river running by,
[01:11.97]The sunset and the morning
[01:16.23]That brightens up the sky.
[01:19.73]
[01:20.82]The cold wind in the winter,
[01:24.43]The pleasant summer sun,
[01:27.93]The ripe fruits in the garden,
[01:32.97]He made them every one.
[01:38.55]
[01:39.31]All things bright and beautiful,
[01:42.92]All creatures great and small,
[01:47.08]All things wise and wonderful:
[01:50.80]The Lord God made them all.
[01:54.08]
[01:55.06]He gave us eyes to see them,
[01:58.78]And lips that we might tell
[02:02.61]How great is God Almighty,
[02:07.10]Who has made all things well.
[02:10.70]
[02:11.47]All things bright and beautiful,
[02:14.76]All creatures great and small,
[02:18.69]All things wise and wonderful:
[02:25.58]The Lord God made them all.
