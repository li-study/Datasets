[00:07.00]The last that ever she saw him
[00:11.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:15.00]He passed on worried and warning
[00:18.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[00:22.00]Lost in a river last saturday night
[00:26.00]Far away on the other side.
[00:29.00]He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
[00:33.00]And she couldn't find how to push through
[00:37.00]The trees that whisper in the evening
[00:41.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:44.00]Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
[00:48.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:52.00]All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
[00:55.00]Far away on the other side.
[00:59.00]He was shot six times by a man on the run
[01:03.00]And she couldn't find how to push through
[01:07.00]I stay
[01:09.00]I pray
[01:10.00]I see you in heaven far away
[01:15.00]I stay
[01:17.00]I pray
[01:18.00]I see you in heaven one day
[01:22.00]Four am in the morning
[01:25.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[01:29.00]I watched your vision forming
[01:33.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[01:36.00]Star was light in a silvery night
[01:40.00]Far away on the other side
[01:43.00]Will you come to talk to me this night
[01:48.00]But she couldn't find how to push through
[01:52.00]I stay
[01:54.00]I pray
[01:55.00]I see you in heaven far away
[01:59.00]I stay
[02:01.00]I pray
[02:02.00]I see you in heaven one day
[02:21.00]
[02:26.00]Far away on the other side.
[02:48.00]
[02:52.00]Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
[02:59.00]The night was heavy but the air was alive
[03:03.00]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:09.00]
[03:10.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[03:18.00]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[03:25.00]Far away on the other side.
