[00:13]Yes...
[00:16]Mmmm....
[00:19]I can't believe the news today
[00:24]Oh, I can't close my eyes
[00:26]And make it go away
[00:29]How long...
[00:31]How long must we sing this song
[00:34]How long  How long
[00:39]'cause tonight...we can be as one
[00:44]Tonight
[00:50]Broken bottles under children's feet
[00:54]Bodies strewn across the dead end street
[01:00]But I won't heed the battle call
[01:04]It puts my back up
[01:06]Puts my back up against the wall
[01:09]Sunday  Bloody Sunday
[01:14]Sunday  Bloody Sunday
[01:19]Sunday  Bloody Sunday
[01:23]
[01:38]And the battle's just begun
[01:42]There's many lost  but tell me who has won
[01:47]The trench is dug within our hearts
[01:52]And mothers  children  brothers  sisters
[01:54]Torn apart
[01:56]Sunday  Bloody Sunday
[02:01]Sunday  Bloody Sunday

[02:08]How long must we sing this song
[02:10]How long  How long

[03:33]
[03:52]And it's true we are immune
[03:57]When fact is fiction and TV reality
[04:02]And today the millions cry
[04:06]We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
[04:11](Sunday  Bloody Sunday)
