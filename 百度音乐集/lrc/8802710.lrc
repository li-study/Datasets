[00:00.75]Definitely Maybe
[00:03.97]FM Static
[00:06.62]
[00:10.97]I met a girl named Tara
[00:13.06]And she lived in the heart of America
[00:15.72]She liked black caddies,listened to Puff Daddy
[00:18.32]And danced until her legs were sore.
[00:19.96]
[00:21.21]She worked around a corner
[00:23.32]At a diner with a grouchy owner
[00:25.83]And her boyfriend Shady dates another girl named Katie,
[00:29.19]He loves her definitely maybe…
[00:30.91]
[00:31.22]Don't think I can take it,
[00:32.36]Wake me when it's over..
[00:33.68]She lives so far away,
[00:34.79]I wish that it was closer…
[00:36.18]I see you everyday,
[00:37.46]I'm too scared to go over.
[00:38.77]I wonder what she'd say,
[00:40.02]I barely even know her…
[00:41.28]
[00:42.05]And how much longer
[00:43.93]Will this keep getting stronger?
[00:46.49]I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep…
[00:52.16]Cause he's a faker,
[00:54.55]So see ya later.
[00:56.67]I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me…
[00:59.87]
[01:01.79]I saw you in the hallway
[01:03.67]When my last class was just over
[01:06.29]It was Friday, school was out tonight,
[01:09.43]Everything seems to be alright.
[01:11.73]I said, "Yo, are you going to the party at the cove?"
[01:16.39]She said,"He's picking me up at 6 again,
[01:19.39]and I don't wanna disappoint my boyfriend."
[01:22.17]
[01:22.89]And how much longer
[01:24.72]Will this keep getting stronger?
[01:27.28]I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep…
[01:33.01]Cause he's a faker,
[01:35.37]So see ya later.
[01:37.43]I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me…
[01:40.86]
[01:42.88]And she's staring at his picture hanging in her locker,
[01:45.43]She's telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her.
[01:47.93]I saw what really happened all those time he went for water,
[01:50.44]When we were at the movie theatre watching Harry Potter.
[01:53.11]He had his hands on
[01:54.15]Every single girl he laid his eyes on.
[01:55.98]Hate to break it to ya,
[01:56.96]He's a pylon.
[01:59.17]And even when he kissed her,
[02:01.04]He was looking over staring at her sister.
[02:03.11]
[02:03.69]And how much longer
[02:05.55]Will this keep getting stronger?
[02:08.18]I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep…
[02:14.00]Cause he's a faker,
[02:16.25]So see ya later.
[02:18.32]I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me…
