[00:02.43]Eric's Song
[00:03.73]Vienna Teng
[00:05.21]Waking Hour
[00:06.12]
[00:21.31]strange how you know inside me
[00:26.58]I measure the time and I stand amazed
[00:33.44]strange how I know inside you
[00:38.33]my hand is outstretched toward the damp of the haze
[00:43.15]
[00:46.22]and of course I forgive
[00:49.07]I've seen how you live
[00:51.12]like a phoenix you rise from the ashes
[00:56.37]you pick up the pieces
[00:58.58]and the ghosts in the attic
[01:01.21]they never quite leave
[01:06.24]and of course I forgive
[01:08.54]you've seen how I live
[01:10.71]I've got darkness and fears to appease
[01:16.14]my voices and analogies
[01:18.70]ambitions like ribbons
[01:20.97]worn bright on my sleeve
[01:25.81]
[01:26.98]strange how we know each other
[01:30.02]
[01:40.48]strange how I fit into you
[01:45.35]there's a distance erased with the greatest of ease
[01:52.11]strange how you fit into me
[01:57.02]a gentle warmth filling the deepest of needs
[02:02.58]
[02:04.65]and with each passing day
[02:07.04]the stories we say
[02:08.91]draw us tighter into our addiction
[02:14.15]confirm our conviction
[02:16.71]that some kind of miracle
[02:19.47]passed on our heads
[02:24.18]and how I am sure
[02:26.53]like never before
[02:28.54]of my reasons for defying reason
[02:33.73]embracing the seasons
[02:35.98]we dance through the colors
[02:38.39]both followed and led
[02:43.29]
[02:43.81]strange how we fit each other
[02:46.45]
[03:20.76]strange how certain the journey
[03:25.74]time unfolds the petals for our eyes to see
[03:33.03]strange how this journey's hurting
[03:37.98]in ways we accept as part of fate's decree
[03:43.22]
[03:45.38]so we just hold on fast
[03:48.29]acknowledge the past
[03:50.31]as lessons exquisitely crafted
[03:55.37]painstakingly drafted
[03:57.74]to carve us as instruments
[04:00.66]that play the music of life
[04:04.87]for we don't realize
[04:07.55]our faith in the prize
[04:09.86]unless it's been somehow elusive
[04:14.76]how swiftly we choose it
[04:17.42]the sacred simplicity
[04:20.15]of you at my side
