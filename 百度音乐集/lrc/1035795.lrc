[00:20.54]静听手表一分一秒在颤抖
[00:27.82]问我为何存在世上像分针拚搏
[00:34.51]如常地每晚每日工作 倦了么
[00:41.67]然而又再泛起你哼的那句歌
[00:48.44]DON'T NEED TO FEAR
[00:50.42]DON'T NEED TO CRY
[00:52.02]DON'T NEED TO WORRY
[00:53.77]I WILL BE THERE
[00:57.13]每当我倦了
[00:59.55]看不见我未来
[01:02.90]视线没法打开
[01:06.42]流泪前还是记起
[01:09.38]DON'T NEED TO FEAR
[01:10.76]DON'T NEED TO CRY
[01:12.41]DON'T NEED TO WORRY
[01:14.55]I WILL BE THERE
[01:17.58]也许长路里
[01:19.78]有这么 一个人
[01:23.30]便而无悔这生
[01:25.89]这友情能伴我
[01:28.57]TOGETHER
[01:30.23]TOGETHER
[01:32.32]WOO...TOGETHER
[01:35.39]TOGETHER
[01:43.43]TOGETHER WITH YOU
