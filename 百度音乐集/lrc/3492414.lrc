[00:12.61]
[00:13.32]So young for death,
[00:24.40]We walk in shoes too big
[00:32.20]But you play it like a poet,
[00:36.28]Like you always did.
[00:39.52]
[00:45.31]And I lay face upturned on the palm of God,
[00:59.79]Pushed on by the fingertips of dreams,
[01:08.15]They haunted me,
[01:10.08]Consoling me.
[01:12.47]
[01:12.72]And I would like to call, call it beauty,
[01:19.67]Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
[01:26.72]And I would like to call it beauty, ....
[01:38.50]
[01:40.12]You slept a sigh like the angels speak,
[01:58.24]And we danced into tomorrow on bleeding feet
[02:11.57]And I had thought that I would die here
[02:25.46]But you pushed me on,
[02:29.99]You pushed me on,
[02:32.80]You pushed me on
[02:36.33]
[02:36.93](Oh) And I would like to call it ,call it beauty,
[02:44.88]Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
[02:51.84]And I would like to call it beauty, ....
[03:03.28]
[03:04.11]You can keep it all locked up in your leaden chest
[03:09.88]Or you can lay mouth open on the water's edge
[03:16.68]But all your angels and your God will stitch and wash you
[03:25.69]
[03:28.61]Oh I would like to call, call it beauty,
[03:37.02]Strained as love's become, it still amazes me
[03:44.05]And I would like to call it beauty, ....
[03:58.36]
