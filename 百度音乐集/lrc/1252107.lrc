[00:47.92]We've come a long way,
[00:50.15]but we're not too sure where we've been.
[00:56.17]We've had success, we've had good times,
[01:03.76]but remember this.
[01:06.55]1.Been on this path of life for so long,
[01:13.52]feel I've walked a thousand miles,
[01:19.05]sometimes strolled hand in hand with love,
[01:24.23]ev'ry body's been there.
[01:27.24]With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope,
[01:34.54]I knew I could make it,
[01:37.45]once I knew the boundaries,
[01:40.44]I looked into the clouds and saw
[01:45.37]my face in the moonlight,
[01:48.33]just then I realised whata fool I could be,
[01:53.45]just cause I look so high I don't have to see me,
[01:59.19]finding a paradise wasn't easy but still,
[02:03.51]there's a road going down the other side of this hill.
[02:09.83]Never forget where you've come here from,
[02:14.55]never pretend that it's all rea,
[02:19.54]someday soon this will all be someone else's dream,
[02:26.24]this will be someone else's dream.
[02:30.50]2.Been safe from the arms of disappointment for so long,
[02:37.95]feel each day we've come too far,
[02:43.12]yet each day seems to make much more.
[02:48.56]Sure is good to be here,
[02:51.57]I understand the meaning of 'I can't explain this feeling' now
[02:58.59]and it feels so unreal.
[03:02.76]At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make,
[03:09.66]the fact of reality.
[03:12.11]Never forget where you've come here from,
[03:17.90]never pretend that it's all real,
[03:23.02]someday soon this will al be someone else's dream,
[03:29.15]this will be someone elses dream.
[03:35.46]We've come so far and we've reach so high,
[03:40.30]and we've look each day and night in the eye
[03:46.48]and we're still so young and we hope for more.
[03:52.87]But remember this, we're not invincible,
[03:58.49]we're not invincible, (No)
[04:00.54]we're only people, we're only people, hey
[04:07.29]we're not invincible, we're not invincible.
[04:14.35]So girl I'll tell you,
[04:36.97][04:15.67]never forget where you're come here from,
[04:44.49][04:20.76]never pretend that it's all reall,
[04:47.43][04:23.70]someday soon this will be all someone else's dream,
[04:53.95][04:33.78]this will be someone else's dream.
