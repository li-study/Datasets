[00:06.50]Piece Of My Heart Lyrics
[00:17.49]白色跨栏·
[00:19.98]How could this happen, I don"t understand
[00:28.06]Falling in love was just not in my plan
[00:34.95]But I want you to know,
[00:38.12]You just got a piece of my heart
[00:45.84]
[00:47.82]I"ve been through the changes
[00:49.19]I"ve walked through the pain
[00:53.25]I"ve told myself I would never do this again
[00:57.09]But I want you to know,
[01:02.65]You just got a piece of my heart
[01:11.74]"Cause love has been a stranger,
[01:15.07]Love has been cruel
[01:18.16]Lovin"s made me feel like the world"s one and only fool
[01:22.19]And I promised myself I would never trust my heart again
[01:35.60]I protected my feelings
[01:39.62]I fought to be free
[01:42.89]I can"t believe I would let this happen to me
[01:48.85]But I want you to know
[01:52.12]You just got a piece of my heart
[02:01.15]Tell me where did you come from
[02:04.62]Tell me who sent you here
[02:07.65]Whatever the reason, girl God made the message clear
[02:14.14]"Cause nobody else can make me feel the way that you do
[02:17.03]I just gotta say
[02:25.27]That the struggle is over
[02:28.67]My story"s true, I finally realized
[02:31.85]I want to spend my life with you
[02:38.59]"Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel
[02:44.19]And I swear I know this time it"s real
[02:57.22]Never in my lifetime, in my wildest dreams
[03:03.01]Could I ever ever imagine the love that you brought to me
[03:06.00]"Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel
[03:19.90]How could this happen, I don"t understand
[03:27.77]Falling in love was just not in my plan
[03:30.46]But I want you to know,
[03:37.08]You just got a piece of my heart
[03:41.96]But I want you to know,
[03:49.80]You just got a piece of my heart
[03:57.53]Just got a piece of my heart
