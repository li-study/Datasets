[00:05.80]dream theater
[00:10.28]
[00:30.11]Live another day
[00:33.33]Climb A little higher
[00:36.81]Find another reason to stay
[00:43.68]Ashes in your hands
[00:46.87]Mercy in your eyes
[00:50.78]If you're searching for a silent sky...
[00:57.47]You won't find it here
[01:00.65]Look another way
[01:04.16]You won't find it here
[01:07.55]So die another day
[01:14.96]
[01:24.69]The coldness of his words
[01:27.85]The message in his silence,
[01:32.13]"Face the candle to the wind..
[01:38.18]This distance in my voice
[01:41.36]Isn't leaving you a choice
[01:44.22]So if you're looking for a time to run away...
[01:51.77]You won't find it here
[01:55.28]Look another way
[01:58.80]You won't find it here
[02:02.06]So try another day
[02:14.19]
[02:20.45]They took pictures of our dreams
[02:23.61]Ran to hide behind the stairs
[02:27.27]And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall
[02:33.76]But if they don't come down
[02:37.19]Resist the need to pull them in
[02:41.50]And throw them away
[02:44.95]Better to save the mystery
[02:50.87]Than surrender to the secret
[03:17.46]
[03:27.62]You won't find it here
[03:30.95]Look another way
[03:34.29]You won't find it here
[03:37.90]So try another day
[03:44.29]
