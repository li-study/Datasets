[00:05.00]Foolish Games
[00:10.00]By Jewel
[00:16.00]You took your coat off and stood in the rain
[00:24.00]You were always crazy like that
[00:30.00]I watched from my window
[00:35.00]Always felt I was outside looking in on you
[00:44.00]You were always the mysterious one
[00:48.00]with dark eyes and careless hair
[00:51.00]You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
[00:59.00]Then you stood in my doorway with nothing to say
[01:07.00]besides some comment on the weather
[01:12.00]Well in case you failed to notice
[01:16.00]in case you failed to see
[01:19.00]This is my heart bleeding before you
[01:24.00]This is me down on my knees
[01:27.00]These foolish games are tearing me apart
[01:42.00]Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
[01:56.00]You're breaking my heart
[02:06.00]You were always brilliant in the morning
[02:10.00]Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
[02:20.00]Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
[02:23.00]You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
[02:29.00]As I clumsily strummed my guitar
[02:34.00]Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
[02:41.00]Somebody who gave a damn
[02:45.00]Somebody more like myself
[02:48.00]These foolish games are tearing me apart
[03:03.00]Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
[03:19.00]You're breaking my heart
[03:37.00]You took your coat off and stood in the rain
[03:46.00]You were always crazy like that
