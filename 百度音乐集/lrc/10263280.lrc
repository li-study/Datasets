[00:07.50]Carpenters
[00:08.50]
[00:13.50]Day after day I must face a world of strangers
[00:18.50]Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
[00:25.50]It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
[00:30.50]Who will always care, you're always there
[00:36.50]When there's no getting over that rainbow
[00:42.50]When my smallest of dreams won't come true
[00:47.50]I can take all the madness the world has to give
[00:53.50]But I won't last a day without you
[01:00.24]
[01:09.00]So many times when the city seems to be without a friendly face
[01:16.50]A lonely place
[01:20.50]It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
[01:25.50]And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile
[01:31.00]When there's no getting over that rainbow
[01:36.50]When my smallest of dreams won't come true
[01:43.10]I can take all the madness the world has to give
[01:48.87]But I won't last a day without you
[01:55.30]Touch me and I end up singing
[02:01.01]Troubles seem to up and disappear
[02:06.33]You touch me with the love you're bringing
[02:12.14]I can't really lose when you're near
[02:17.06]
[02:20.19]If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
[02:25.17]They're not unkind, just hard to find
[02:31.56]One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
[02:36.85]Without the rest, I found the best
[02:41.98]When there's no getting over that rainbow
[02:47.66]When my smallest of dreams won't come true
[02:52.93]I can take all the madness the world has to give
[02:58.96]But I won't last a day without you
[03:04.35]When there's no getting over that rainbow
[03:09.93]When my smallest of dreams won't come true
[03:14.96]I can take all the madness the world has to give
[03:20.33]But I won't last a day without you
[03:30.58]Won't last a day without you...
