[00:13.54]Sometimes your calling, comes in dreams
[00:18.40]Sometimes in comes in the Spirit's breeze,
[00:30.00]And call out for the things of eternity.
[00:36.31]But I'm a man, of dust and stains,
[00:41.36]You move in me, so I can say,
[Chorus:]
[00:45.34]Here I am, Lord send me,
[00:49.29]All of my life, I make an offering,
[00:55.42]Here I am, Lord send me,
[01:00.69]Somehow my story, Is a part of your plan,
[01:11.07]Here I am
[01:16.49]When setbacks and failures, and upset plans,
[01:21.97]Test my faith and leave me with empty hands,
[01:26.38]Are you not the closest when it's hardest to stand?
[01:31.15]I know that you will finish what you began.
[01:37.42]These broken parts you redeem,
[01:41.11]Become the song, that I can sing
[01:45.02]Here I am, Lord send me,
[01:50.67]All of my life, I make an offering,
[01:57.01]Here I am, Lord send me,
[02:02.73]Somehow my story, Is a part of your plan,
[02:08.81]Here I am
[02:12.59]Overwhelmed by the thought of my weakness,
[02:16.74]And the fear that I'll fail you in the end,
[02:22.02]In this mess, I'm just one of the pieces,
[02:26.27]I can't put this together but you can.
[02:31.56]Here I am, Lord send me,
[02:40.67]I wanna live my life as an offering
[02:42.14]Here I am, Lord send me,
[02:48.60]Somehow my story, Is part of your plan,
[02:53.41]Here I am
[03:00.08]Here I am, all my life an offering to you, to you
[03:11.64]Somehow my story, Is a part of your plan,
[03:16.52]Here I am
