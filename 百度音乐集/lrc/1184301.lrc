[01:05.93]
[01:32.62]We all came out to Montreux
[01:36.37]On the Lake Geneva shoreline
[01:40.84]To make records with a mobile
[01:46.48]We didn't have much time
[01:49.77]Frank Zappa and the Mothers
[01:53.09]Were at the best place around
[01:57.06]But some stupid with a flare gun
[02:01.33]Burned the place to the ground
[02:05.81]Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
[02:13.78]Smoke on the water
[02:21.95]
[02:33.94]They burned down the gambling house
[02:37.50]It died with an awful sound
[02:42.04]Funky & Claude was running in and out
[02:47.12]Pulling kids out the ground
[02:50.25]When it all was over
[02:53.99]We had to find another place
[02:58.22]But Swiss time was running out
[03:01.69]It seemed that we would lose the race
[03:06.45]Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
[03:14.41]Smoke on the water
[04:28.55]we ended up at the grand hotel
[04:32.84]it was empty cold and bare
[04:35.94]but with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
[04:41.64]making our music there
[04:44.46]with a few red lights and a few old beds
[04:48.53]we make a place to sweat
[04:52.47]no matter what we get out of this
[04:55.71]i know i know well never forget
[05:00.68]smoke on the water, fire in the sky
[05:08.47]smoke on the water
[05:40.86]
