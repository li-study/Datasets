[00:05.73]Take Me Out
[00:10.06]by ANNA
[00:11.86]It's been a long long day
[00:16.76]Sunshine breaking through the clouds and watching me
[00:23.39]I was sitting in the park
[00:28.29]I was waiting for someone to take me out
[00:33.91]Sacrifice comes in a different package
[00:39.48]I'm tired of living with pain
[02:56.85][00:46.68]Take me out
[02:59.89][00:50.05]Hatred is blind as well as love
[03:04.11][00:53.94]You have to turn hate to love
[03:08.11][00:58.10]Get me out
[03:11.08][01:01.25]From this world of anger and rage
[03:15.30][01:05.41]You will find your way to heaven
[03:26.27][03:20.54][01:10.30]I promise that I'll meet you when you're there
[01:19.98]It's been a long long trip
[01:24.93]Sunshine is setting in the west and cry
[01:31.17]I was walking by the stream
[01:36.23]I was conscious that strangers are staring at me
[01:41.92]Don't look at me with hateful eyes
[01:47.37]I'm tired of living with pain
[01:54.69]Take me out
[01:57.78]Too many tears stroked on my cheek
[02:02.22]No more tears with regret
[02:05.88]Get me out
[02:08.91]From this world of anger and rage
[02:13.36]You will find your way to heaven
[02:18.54]I promise I'll meet you when you're there
[02:34.17]I heard too many people were crying for help
[02:40.25]God forgive sins
[02:44.20]Otherwise heaven would be empty
[02:50.50]So wash away your grimy hands
