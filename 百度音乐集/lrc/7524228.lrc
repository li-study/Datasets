[00:00.00]The Technicolor Phase
[00:02.62]Owl City
[00:04.77]
[00:17.14]I am the red in the rose, the flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
[00:25.09]And I am the gray in the ghost
[00:28.43]that hides with your clothes behind your closet door
[00:33.48]I am the green in the grass that bends back from underneath your feet
[00:41.44]And I am the blue in your back alley view where the horizon and the rooftops meet
[00:50.00]
[01:07.52]If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors of the evening stars
[01:15.71]You can go anywhere you wish cuz I’ll be there  wherever you are
[01:22.99]wherever you are
[01:23.50]
[01:57.00]I will always meet your gaze
[02:04.72]When we are lost in the Technicolor phase
[02:13.57]I am the black in the book, the letters on the pages that you memorize
[02:21.89]And I am the orange in the overcast  a color that you visualize
[02:30.37]I am the white in the walls that soak up all the sound when you cannot sleep
[02:38.47]And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
[02:42.73]that wish the harbor wasn’t quite so deep
[02:47.54]
[03:04.46]If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors of the evening stars
[03:12.71]You can go anywhere you wish cuz I’ll be there wherever you are
[03:20.21]wherever you are
[03:21.79]
[03:28.37]wherever you are
[03:31.18]
[03:44.54]wherever you are
[03:47.80]
[03:52.88]wherever you are
[04:02.30]
