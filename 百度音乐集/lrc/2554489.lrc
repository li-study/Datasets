[00:01.15]Artist: The Kooks lyrics
[00:02.13]Album: Inside In / Inside Out
[00:03.15]Year: 2006
[00:04.04]Title: Sofa Song
[00:08.57]
[00:12.50]The city freeze for
[00:15.07]I just realised I don't like you
[00:18.78]Me and my girl
[00:21.64]Are going out for some air
[00:24.52]And I will do my best
[00:27.11]Just to get under her dress
[00:30.39]And catch you out if I can
[00:33.21]On the other side of my sofa
[00:37.20]
[00:37.70]Won't you come on over
[00:40.64]At the side of my sofa
[00:43.79]Oh won't you come on over
[00:47.72]
[01:00.64]The city heated up it
[01:03.52]It got blurry cause I'd had enough
[01:06.49]And he tried to take your soul
[01:08.89]But didn't realise you keep it in a different hole
[01:13.52]
[01:13.96]Won't you come on over
[01:17.05]At the side of my sofa
[01:20.10]Oh won't you come on over
[01:25.15]
[01:30.94]So here he comes, a man with
[01:34.19]A loaded gun, I don't know if he
[01:37.39]Wants my soul or my
[01:39.80]Cash flow, I s'pose I don't know
[01:42.49]
[01:43.21]So here he comes, a man with a
[01:45.90]A loaded gun I don't know if he
[01:49.10]Wants my girl's heart or her pearls
[01:53.53]I s'pose I don't know
[01:56.45]I s'pose I don't know
[01:59.51]I s'pose I don't know
[02:02.33]I s'pose I don't know
[02:05.60]I s'pose I don't know
