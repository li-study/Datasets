[00:00.00]The All American Rejects
[00:10.94]Dance Inside
[00:16.05]You don't have to move, you don't have to speak
[00:21.68]lips for biting.
[00:24.76]you're staring me down, a glance makes me weak
[00:29.67]eyes for striking
[00:40.11]now I'm twisting up when I'm twisted with you
[00:45.41]brush so lightly
[00:47.83]and time trickles down, and I'm breathing for two
[00:52.79]squeeze so tightly.
[00:56.18]I'll be fine, you'll be fine.
[01:01.08]this moment seems so long
[01:03.96]don't waste now, precious time
[01:08.56]we'll dance inside the song
[01:11.79]What makes the one to shake you down?
[01:15.91]each touch belongs to each new sound
[01:19.36]say now you want to shake me too
[01:23.11]move down to me, slip into you
[01:27.99]She sinks in my mind as she sheds through her skin
[01:32.69]touch sight tastes like fire
[01:35.99]hands do now what eyes no longer defend
[01:40.61]hands to fuel desire
[01:43.57]I'll be fine, you'll be fine
[01:48.66]this moment seems so long
[01:51.70]don't waste now, precious time
[01:56.46]we'll dance inside the song
[01:58.44]What makes the one to shake you down?
[02:02.22]each touch belongs to each new sound
[02:06.14]say now you want to shake me too
[02:10.11]move down to me, slip into you
[02:32.77]Ooo, ah
[02:47.27]And I'll be fine, you'll be fine
[02:50.99]is this fine? I'm not fine
[02:54.85]give me pieces, give me things to stay awake (stay awake)
[03:03.08]What makes the one to shake you down?
[03:06.96]each touch belongs to each new sound
[03:10.77]say now you want to shake me too
[03:14.79]move down to me, slip into you
[03:18.72]What makes the one to shake you down?
[03:22.18]each touch belongs to each new sound
[03:26.51]say now you want to shake me too
[03:30.21]move down to me, slip into you
[03:34.34]move down to me, slip into you
[03:43.27]Ooo, ah
