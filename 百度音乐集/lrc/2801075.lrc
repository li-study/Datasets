[00:03.27]Mountain
[00:14.65]Good Charlotte
[00:22.95]
[00:25.43]All these dreams and all these plans
[00:28.05]I built them all with these two hands
[00:31.00]Everything I've realized my dreams
[00:35.39]
[00:35.95]The city lights shine down
[00:38.29]And they blind me sometimes
[00:41.28]But through it all
[00:42.80]I was lost but I found my way
[00:46.31]
[00:47.44]Tell me what you want
[00:50.26]'Cause I would give you anything
[00:53.12]Tell me what you need and I'll go get it.
[00:58.51]Iâ€™d give up all these dreams
[01:01.25]To have you in my arms right now
[01:04.13]I'd give up everything and I don't care
[01:09.30]
[01:10.13][sings low] it wasnt all on the mountains
[01:15.61]When it came to me
[01:20.18]
[01:21.30]All my life's been wasted
[01:26.83]Chasing shallow dreams
[01:31.71]
[01:32.18]Here we are, let me lift you up
[01:37.02]And show you this world over me
[01:42.77]And all these dreams, and what I've gained
[01:45.70]And what I've saved
[01:47.15]Can't compare to the love
[01:50.98]That you could give to me
[01:53.55]
[01:54.46]So,Tell me what you want
[01:56.99]'Cause I would give you anything
[02:00.20]Tell me what you need and I'll go get it
[02:05.73]I'd give up all these dreams
[02:08.42]To have you in my arms right now
[02:11.31]I'd give up everything and I don't care
[02:15.76]
[02:16.95]It wasnt all on the mountains
[02:22.81]When it came to me
[02:27.56]
[02:28.43]All my lifes been wasted
[02:34.11]Chasing shallow dreams
[02:39.42]
[02:42.43]Years go by and nothing's slowing down the time
[02:48.09]Years go by and then they're wasted
[02:53.64]All this time, I thought that I gave everything
[02:58.92]But you're not mine, and I'm so empty
[03:03.94]
[03:04.72]It wasnt all on the mountains
[03:10.34]When it came, when it came to me
[03:14.82]
[03:16.25]All my lifes been wasted
[03:22.03]Chasing shallow dreams
[03:27.98]
[03:39.47]So please come back to me
[03:41.97]I've been waiting
[03:45.03]So please come back to me...
