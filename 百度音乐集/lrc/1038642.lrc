[00:20.11]You're running a case against me,
[00:22.48]Prosector judge and jury,
[00:24.76]We′ve had this conversation in your head,
[00:27.33]′cause I wasn′t there,you made up what I said,
[00:29.11]Or what I would have said,you know me so well,
[00:31.49]you heard how I am and how I'm going to heaven knows,
[00:34.53]We′ve never had this conversation,or should I be calling it a condemnation,
[00:38.87]′cause you're not listening to me.
[00:42.51]
[00:43.18]So na na na na na,
[00:46.40]That′s all I′m gonna say,
[00:48.68]′Cause na na na na na,

[00:55.50]There′s nothing I can do,
[00:58.19]so na na na na na,
[01:00.50]Couldn′t we be friends if not for you.
[01:05.91]
[01:12.89]I feel like a teacher from Charlie Brown,
[01:15.36]All you hear is that wa-wa-wa sound,
[01:17.78]Maybe I′m a pokemon, Pikachu,
[01:20.32]′cause that what comes out when I′m talking to you,
[01:22.84]You're a crusader you′ve made up your fight,
[01:25.17]Your Super-hero name is Mr. Right,
[01:27.45]Instead of trying to understand,
[01:29.86]You show all your friends how wrong I am,
[01:32.25]And you′re still not listening to me.
[01:36.18]
[01:36.78]So na na na na na,
[01:38.96]That′s all I′m gonna say,
[01:41.39]′Cause na na na na na,
[01:43.86]Made up your mind any way,
[01:46.23]na na na na na,
[01:48.71]There′s nothing I can do,
[01:51.04]so na na na na na,
[01:53.42]Couldn′t we be friends if not for you.
[02:00.65]
[02:05.75]Can′t we be friends,
[02:08.73]Why does it end,
[02:11.06]Before a word is even heard,
[02:15.81]I look at you your attitude,
[02:20.46]Why can′t you see,
[02:22.74]That it′s not me.
[02:24.96]
[02:25.37]Oops I did it again, I see,
[02:26.96]The person I′m talking about is me,
[02:29.18]Assuming you the enemy,
[02:31.46]In the cross hairs of my verbal uzi,
[02:34.03]No matter who wins we both lose,
[02:36.20]No matter who starts we both choose,
[02:38.48]To keep it going on and on and on and on and on,
[02:43.43]But lets start listening and see.
[02:47.12]
[02:48.44]La la la la la,
