[00:20.50]Each time I see a crowd of people
[00:28.10]Just like a fool I stop and stare
[00:37.14]Its really not the proper thing to do
[00:47.99]But maybe you'll be there
[00:55.43]I go out walking after midnight
[01:06.50]Along the lonely thoroughfare
[01:13.74]Its not the time or place
[01:19.11]To look for you
[01:26.89]But maybe you'll be there
[01:34.50]You said your arms would always hold me
[01:43.07]You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
[01:52.46]Now after all those things you told me
[02:04.34]How could it end like this
[02:14.04]Someday if all my prayers are answered
[02:24.21]I'll hear a footstep on the stair
[02:34.34]With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
[02:44.40]And maybe you'll Be there
[02:52.14]
[03:33.23]You said your arms would always hold me
[03:45.04]You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
[03:54.44]Now after all those things you told me
[04:07.14]How could it end like this
[04:18.04]Someday if all my prayers are answered
[04:29.34]I'll hear a footstep on the stair
[04:40.04]With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
[04:49.14]And maybe you'll be there
