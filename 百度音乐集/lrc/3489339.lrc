[00:01.52]
[00:10.71]I called an empty heart
[00:15.68]It's not a way to start
[00:20.73]I'm not detating who you are to be
[00:24.94]But I try, to be open
[00:30.37]
[00:30.87]This flaw's affecting my brain
[00:35.88]All of my feelings to blame
[00:40.92]The things I'm asking they don't seem to work
[00:44.84]All them miles, of the ocean
[00:50.88]
[00:51.38]But not have you, is suffering
[00:56.37]But then loving you is hard
[00:59.77]
[01:00.25]I'd say the words
[01:02.41]But I don't understand the meaning
[01:05.63]I know I'll never start believing in the truth
[01:10.93]I try to quit, but I can't make you go away
[01:15.34]Cause it's still what I got to do
[01:20.22]And so I walk the walk
[01:25.24]That leads me to you
[01:30.31]And now I walk the walk
[01:35.19]For you
[01:41.50]
[01:42.00]Won't you save this dance
[01:46.82]Is this our one last chance
[01:52.19]Those things I wanted so much in the past
[01:56.19]Have left, me uncertain
[02:02.17]
[02:02.67]Not wanting you is leveling
[02:07.48]But not needing you is sad
[02:11.00]
[02:11.47]I'd say the words
[02:13.81]But I don't understand the meaning
[02:15.83]I know I'll never start believing in the truth
[02:21.11]I try to quit, but I can't make you go away
[02:25.48]Cause it's still what I got to do
[02:30.39]And so I walk the walk
[02:35.43]That leads me to you
[02:40.55]And now I walk the walk
[02:45.41]For you
[02:51.33]
[02:51.83]And I know that
[02:54.64]I won't be wasting my way
[02:58.71]I know that I have made my mistakes
[03:02.14]And I'm hoping
[03:04.41]You'll be on the other side
[03:08.89]You'll wait for me this time
[03:18.12]
[03:18.62]I'd say the words
[03:21.01]But I don't understand the meaning
[03:24.08]I know I'll never start believing in the truth
[03:29.40]I try to quit, but I can't make you go away
[03:33.75]Cause it's still what I got to do
[03:38.73]And so I walk the walk
[03:43.58]That leads me to you
[03:48.75]And now I walk the walk
[03:53.64]For you
[03:58.50]
[03:59.00]And now I walk the walk
[04:03.80]For you
[04:07.80]
