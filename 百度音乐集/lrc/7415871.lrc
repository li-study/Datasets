[00:01.52]
[00:09.99]Somewhere along the way, my hopefulness turned to sadness,
[00:14.20]Somewhere along the way, my sadness turned to bitterness,
[00:18.51]Somewhere along the way, my bitterness turned to anger,
[00:22.78]Somewhere along the way, my anger turned to vengeance.
[00:26.85]
[00:27.25]And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it,
[00:31.25]And the ones who deserved it, they'll never understand it,
[00:35.47]Yes, I know I'm goin' to hell in a purple basket,
[00:39.81]At least I'll be in another world while you're pissin' on my casket.
[00:46.38]
[00:47.70]How could you be so perfect for me?
[01:04.04]Why can't you ignore the things I did before?
[01:21.54]
[01:23.00]Somewhere along the way, exacting vengeance gave excitement,
[01:27.22]Somewhere along the way, that excitement turned to pleasure,
[01:31.57]Somewhere along the way, that pleasure turned to madness,
[01:35.88]Sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain.
[01:39.79]
[01:40.31]And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it,
[01:44.32]Those who helped me along the way, I smacked them as I thanked them,
[01:48.50]Yes, I know I'm goin' to hell in a leather jacket,
[01:52.68]At least I'll be in another world while you're pissin' on my casket.
[01:57.18]
[01:57.63]All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory,
[02:01.71]All you got to do is sit there, look great, and make them horny.
[02:05.96]Together we'll sing songs and tell exaggerated stories,
[02:09.93]About the way we feel today in the night and in the morning.
[02:16.03]
[02:18.17]How could you be so perfect for me?
[02:34.67]Why can't you ignore the things I did before?
[02:51.59]
[02:52.61]Take all your fears, pretend they're all true,
[03:00.78]Take all your plans, pretend they fell through.
[03:09.36]But that's what it's like,
[03:18.05]That's what it's like for most people in this world.
[03:26.83]
[03:27.74]Rich or the poor.
[03:36.27]Muslims or Jews.
[03:44.70]When roles are reversed.
[03:53.20]Opinions are, too.
[04:01.86]That's all I'm gonna say now.
[04:09.62]Before you come knocking on my door now.
