[00:13.67]How many times you asked yourself before
[00:19.42]What’s the point
[00:23.16]wasting time
[00:26.58]But how many times you stand up for yourself
[00:33.39]Make a point
[00:36.85]you have a reason
[00:40.50]You know
[00:43.18]it’s not fair
[00:47.05]Your life
[00:49.90]belongs to nobody else
[00:54.33]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[01:01.10]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[01:07.83]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[01:14.25]Just open your eyes
[01:16.10]you got everything in the world
[01:21.80]How many times you want to give up yourself
[01:27.74]Once again
[01:30.92]there’s no point
[01:34.92]But how many times you kept on moving on
[01:41.22]Once again
[01:44.62]you have a reason
[01:48.62]You know
[01:51.25]it’s not fair
[01:55.17]Your life
[01:57.84]belongs to nobody else
[02:01.85]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[02:09.11]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[02:15.91]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[02:22.88]Just open your eyes
[02:24.42]you got everything in the world
[02:30.47]Does it make you wonder?
[02:32.85]Is it karma or is it fate
[02:36.06]Is it you
[02:39.37]or is it me
[02:42.27]Oh does it really make you falter
[02:46.33]Does it make you want to believe?
[02:49.75]It is true
[02:52.35]you’re like nobody else
[02:57.16]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[03:03.56]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[03:10.12]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[03:17.04]Just open your eyes
[03:18.88]you got everything in the world
[03:23.79]Just open your eyes
[03:25.83]you got everything in the world
[03:31.09]I open my eyes
[03:33.19]I have you in my world
