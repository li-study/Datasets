[00:05.55]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
[00:10.23]Broke into my world and tore it apart
[00:14.99]I should pick up the pieces, but I don't know where to start
[00:19.60]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
[00:24.34]
[00:25.48]I lost my heart so easily, I feel like a fool
[00:30.55]Against my better judgment, I broke my own rule
[00:35.28]I didn't think I'd fall in love, but what can I do
[00:40.01]Oh, I'm hurting and missing him so
[00:44.29]
[00:45.19]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
[00:49.42]Broke into my world and tore it apart
[00:54.15]I should pick up the pieces, but I don't know where to start
[00:58.89]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
[01:04.51]
[01:27.97]If I felt any better, I think I would die
[01:33.45]'Cause all I do is sit at home, think of him, and cry
[01:38.31]But he ain't worth a single tear that falls from my eye
[01:43.10]So why do I still love him anyway
[01:46.85]
[01:47.69]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
[01:52.60]Broke into my world and tore it apart
[01:57.15]I should pick up the pieces, but I don't know where to start
[02:01.90]Oh, the one that got away, got away with my heart
