[00:19.67]I heard she sang a lullaby
[00:25.63]I heard she sang it from her heart
[00:31.54]When I found out thought I would die
[00:37.37]Because the lullaby was mine
[00:43.22]I heard he sealed it with a kiss
[00:49.10]And gently kissed her cherry lips
[00:55.12]I found that so hard to believe
[01:00.80]Because her kiss belonged to me
[01:05.17]
[01:06.61]How could an angel break my heart?
[01:12.22]Why didn't she catch my falling star?
[01:18.12]I wish I didn't wish so hard
[01:23.99]Maybe I wished our love apart
[01:29.85]How could an angel break my heart?
[01:34.61]
[01:41.65]I heard her face was white as rain
[01:47.54]Soft as a rose that blooms in May
[01:53.29]He keeps her picture in a frame
[01:59.21]And when he sleeps he calls her name
[02:05.15]I wonder if she makes him smile
[02:10.93]The way she used to smile at me
[02:16.89]I hope he doesn't make her laugh
[02:22.66]Because her laugh belongs to me
[02:27.61]
[02:28.56]How could an angel break my heart?
[02:34.35]Why didn't she catch my falling star?
[02:40.17]I wish I didn't wish so hard
[02:46.14]Maybe I wished our love apart
[02:50.54]
[02:52.04]How could an angel break my heart?
[02:56.75]
[03:06.27]Oh my soul is dying, it's crying
[03:17.58]I'm trying to understand
[03:25.53]Please help me

[03:29.94]How could an angel break my heart?
[03:35.94]Why didn't she catch my falling star?
