[00:02.00]Sarah McLachlan - Ice
[00:13.00]
[00:14.50]The ice is thin come on dive in
[00:18.66]underneath my lucid skin
[00:22.40]the cold is lost, forgotten
[00:29.68]Hours pass days pass time stands still
[00:33.57]light gets dark and darkness fills
[00:37.33]my secret heart forbidden...
[00:44.84]
[00:56.00]I think you worried for me then
[00:59.93]the subtle ways that I'd give in but I know
[01:06.38]you liked the show
[01:11.07]tied down to this bed of shame
[01:15.07]you tried to move around the pain but oh
[01:21.00]your soul is anchored
[01:26.25]The only comfort is the moving of the river
[01:33.98]You enter into me, a lie upon your lips
[01:42.01]offer what you can, I'll take all that I can get
[01:48.91]only a fool's here...
[01:59.54]
[02:33.24]I don't like your tragic sighs
[02:37.52]as if your god has passed you by well hey fool
[02:44.00]that's your deception
[02:48.62]your angels speak with jilted tongues
[02:52.27]the serpent's tale has come undone you have no
[02:58.80]strength to squander
[03:03.44]The only comfort is the moving of the river
[03:11.41]You enter into me, a lie upon your lips
[03:19.31]offer what you can, I'll take all that I can get
[03:26.50]only a fool's here to stay
[03:33.68]only a fool's here to stay
[03:41.53]only a fool's here.
