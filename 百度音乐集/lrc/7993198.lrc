[00:19]Paint the town take a bow
[00:21]Thank every body you're gonna do it again
[00:27]You are the few the proud
[00:29]You are the antibody, mind, soul and Zen
[00:35]And the world's a stage
[00:37]And the world's a faze and the end is near
[00:43]So push rewind just in time
[00:45]Thank anybody you're gonna do it again
[00:50]The way that you walk
[00:53]It's just the way that you talk like it ain't no thing
[00:58]And every single day is just a fling
[01:02]Then the morning comes
[01:11]Take your knocks shake them off
[01:14]Duck everybody you're gonna take them again
[01:19]You are your foe, your friend
[01:21]You are the paparazzi
[01:24]You are the tragedian
[01:28]And the world's a craze
[01:30]And the world's a faze and the end is near
[01:35]So push rewind just in time

[01:50]And every single day is just a fling
[01:54]And when it comes it moves so slow
[01:58]Kind of like it's saying "I told you so"
[02:03]Looking back before she goes

[02:32]And the world's a stage
[02:34]And the world's a faze and the end is near
[02:40]So push rewind just in time
[02:42]Thank anybody
