[00:20.90]It's coming on Christmas
[00:23.48]They're cutting down trees
[00:25.71]They're putting up reindeer singing songs of joy and peace
[00:30.52]Oh I wish I had a river
[00:34.38]I could skate away on
[00:38.30]
[00:40.58]But it don't snow here
[00:43.03]It stays pretty green
[00:45.08]I'm going to make a lot of money
[00:47.41]And then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
[00:50.18]Oh I wish I had a river
[00:54.01]I could skate away on
[01:00.26]I wish I had a river so long
[01:05.90]I would teach my feet to fly high
[01:14.33]Oh I wish I had a river
[01:18.21]I could skate away on
[01:21.36]
[01:25.38]I made my baby cry
[01:28.90]
[01:41.96]He tried hard to help me
[01:44.25]You know, he put me at ease
[01:46.54]And he loved me so naughty
[01:48.65]Made me weak in the knees
[01:50.98]Oh I wish I had a river
[01:55.38]I could skate away on
[01:58.96]
[02:01.38]But I'm so hard to handle
[02:03.94]I'm selfish and I'm sad
[02:06.13]Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I've ever had
[02:11.23]Oh I wish I had a river
[02:15.01]I could skate away on
[02:20.93]Oh I wish I had a river so long
[02:25.52]I would teach my feet to fly high
[02:39.41]Oh I wish I had a river
[02:44.12]That I could skate away on
[02:47.23]
[02:51.11]I made my baby say goodbye
[02:55.10]
[03:07.56]It's coming on Christmas
[03:09.87]They're cutting down trees
[03:12.17]They're putting up reindeer singing songs of joy and peace
[03:17.09]Oh I wish I had a river
[03:21.11]I could skate away on
