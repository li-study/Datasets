[00:08.13]Bones
[00:17.70]Radiohead
[00:30.54]I don't want to be crippled and cracked
[00:38.38]Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
[00:47.00]Ground to dust and ash
[00:54.86]Crawling on all fours
[01:01.06]
[01:02.82]When you've got to feel it in your bones
[01:10.94]When you've got to feel it in your bones
[01:19.60]
[01:20.16]Now I can't climb the stairs
[01:28.10]Pieces missing everywhere
[01:36.47]Prozac painkillers
[01:44.04]
[01:44.36]When you've got to feel it in your bones
[01:52.21]When you've got to feel it in your bones
[02:00.77]

[02:08.45]All the children flew when I touched their hands
[02:16.07]
[02:16.77]When you've got to feel it in your bones
