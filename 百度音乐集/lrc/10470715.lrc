[00:12.59]BROTHERS IN ARMS
[00:22.60]These mist covered mountains
[00:28.10]Are a home now for me
[00:35.51]But my home is the lowlands
[00:41.15]And always will be
[00:47.38]Some day you'll return to
[00:53.67]Your valleys and your farms
[00:57.73]And you'll no longer burn
[01:02.55]To be brothers in arms
[01:21.87]Through these fields of destruction
[01:29.91]Baptism of fire
[01:35.33]I've watched all your suffering
[01:43.32]As the battles raged higher
[01:47.41]And though they did hurt me so bad
[01:54.08]In the fear and alarm
[01:59.61]You did not desert me
[02:04.85]My brothers in arms
[02:19.13]There's so many different worlds
[02:28.25]So many different suns
[02:36.09]And we have just one world
[02:42.47]But we live in different ones
[03:15.22]Now the sun's gone to hell
[03:24.07]And the moon's riding high
[03:31.63]Let me bid you farewell
[03:37.09]Every man has to die
[03:43.50]But it's written in the starlight
[03:50.32]And every line on your palm
[03:54.87]We're fools to make war
[04:02.34]On our brothers in arms
