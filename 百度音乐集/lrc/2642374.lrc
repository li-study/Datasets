[Shara Nelson]
[00:34.68]I know that I've imagined love before
[00:38.87]And how it could be with you
[00:42.77]Really hurt me baby, really cut me baby
[00:46.89]How can have a day without a night
[00:51.08]You're the book that I have opened
[00:55.50]And now i've got to know much more
[01:00.88]
[01:16.60]The curiousness of your potential kiss
[01:20.18]Has got my mind and body aching
[01:24.54]Really hurt me baby, really cut me baby
[01:28.64]How can you have a day without a night
[01:32.86]You're the book that I have opened
[01:37.29]And now I've got to know much more
[01:42.57]
[02:52.57][02:44.30][02:35.94][01:58.26]Like a soul without a mind
[02:54.51][02:46.26][02:37.84][02:00.29]In a body without a heart
[02:56.62][02:48.30][02:39.96][02:02.35]I'm missing every part
