[00:09.00]Artist: Boston
[00:13.00]Album: Greatest Hits
[00:18.00]I looked out this morning, and the sun was gone
[00:23.00]Turned on some music to start my day
[00:27.00]Then lost myself in a familiar song
[00:31.50]I closed my eyes, and I slipped away
[00:38.00]Chorus
[00:51.00]It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
[00:55.00]When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
[01:00.00]And I begin dreamin' (more than a feeling)
[01:04.00]Till I see Marianne walk away
[01:09.50]I see my Marianne walkin' away
[01:27.00]So many people have come and gone
[01:31.00]Their faces fade as the years go by
[01:35.50]Yet I still recall as I wander on
[01:40.00]As clear as the sun in summer sky
[01:47.00]Repeat Chorus
[03:04.00]When I'm tired and thinkin' cold
[03:08.50]I hide in my music and forget the day
[03:13.00]And dream of a girl I used to know
[03:17.00]I closed my eyes and she slipped away
[03:29.50]She slipped away
[03:42.00]Repeat Chorus
[04:37.29]
