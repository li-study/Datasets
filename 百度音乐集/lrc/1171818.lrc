[00:00.00]Christina Aguilera - Cruz
[00:00.65]
[00:01.65]I'm leaving today
[00:06.21]Living it, leaving it to change
[00:11.28]
[00:12.64]Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
[00:18.54]Tongue tied, twisted are all my memories
[00:26.22]Celebrating a fantasy come true
[00:32.46]Packing all my bags finally on the move
[00:39.28]
[00:39.93]I'm leaving today
[00:45.54]I'm living it, leaving it to change
[00:51.58]
[00:53.56]As I'm driving I'm captured by the view
[00:59.19]Of so much beauty, the road becomes my muse
[01:07.13]The heat is rising and my head soars through the wind
[01:13.26]Cool, calm, collective is a child that lost a thing
[01:20.46]
[01:20.92]I'm leaving today
[01:26.56]I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
[01:34.52]See I'm leaving today
[01:39.93]I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
[01:47.20]But somehow I'm missing
[01:50.81]I think I really miss it
[01:54.08]One day
[01:57.13]
[01:58.23]Don't walk away
[02:00.79]And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
[02:08.48]Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
[02:14.29]I'm free, finally free
[02:21.40]
[02:25.78]Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
[02:32.15]
[02:39.65]I'm leaving today
[02:45.41]I'm living it, leaving it to change
[02:53.08]See I'm leaving today
[02:59.08]I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
[03:07.05]I'm leaving today (I'm leaving it to change)
[03:13.05]Living it, I'm leaving it to change
[03:18.50]
[03:19.82]Living it, leaving it
[03:22.87]Said I'm living it, leaving it
[03:26.56]Living it, leaving it to change
[03:30.22](I'm leaving it to change)
[03:33.04]But somehow I miss it
[03:36.66]I think I really miss it
[03:39.91]One day
