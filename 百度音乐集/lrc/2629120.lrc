[00:04.67]Moonlight Shadow
[00:06.48]
[00:08.16]The last that ever she saw him
[00:11.72]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:15.60]He passed on worried and warning
[00:19.23]Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[00:23.14]Lost in a river last saturday night
[00:26.85]Far away on the other side.
[00:30.25]He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
[00:34.00]And she couldn't find how to push through
[00:38.12]The trees that whisper in the evening
[00:41.97]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:45.42]Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
[00:49.17]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[00:52.92]All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
[00:56.88]Far away on the other side.
[01:00.11]He was shot six times by a man on the run
[01:04.00]And she couldn't find how to push through
[01:08.67]I stay
[01:10.52]I pray
[01:12.02]I see you in heaven far away
[01:14.49]
[01:16.34]I stay
[01:17.95]I pray
[01:19.21]I see you in heaven one day
[01:22.71]
[01:23.22]Four am in the morning
[01:26.63]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[01:30.34]I watched your vision forming
[01:34.05]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[01:38.09]Star was light in a silvery night
[01:41.36]Far away on the other side
[01:44.95]Will you come to talk to me this night
[01:48.81]But she couldn't find how to push through
[01:51.64]
[01:53.47]I stay
[01:55.09]I pray
[01:56.56]I see you in heaven far away
[02:01.08]I stay
[02:02.91]I pray
[02:04.04]I see you in heaven one day
[02:27.19]Far away on the other side.
[02:52.91]Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
[03:00.00]The night was heavy but the air was alive
[03:03.49]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:13.51]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[03:16.40]Carried away by a moonlight shadow
[03:24.98]Far away on the other side.
