[00:01.50]You Come To My Head
[00:02.75]演唱：蔡健雅    
[00:03.68]
[00:29.26]You come to my head
[00:33.40]When it seems that everyone's saying goodbye
[00:43.04]You come to my head
[00:46.71]When the morning sun arise…arise
[00:56.45]You come to my head
[01:00.50]When a newborn baby cries
[01:10.68]You come to my head
[01:13.84]When I need you in my life
[01:20.39]
[01:51.50]You come to my head
[01:55.25]When the hangin photographs start to fade
[02:05.23]You come to my head
[02:09.13]When two lovers walk hand in hand
[02:18.85]You come to my head
[02:22.64]When I lay alone in bed
[02:32.70]You come to my head
[02:36.58]When someone calls out your name
[02:42.94]
[03:14.95]You come to my head
[03:17.95]When the Dj's playing our favorite song
[03:28.41]You come to my head
[03:31.63]Before I realize that you are gone
[03:42.28]You come to my head
[03:45.48]When there's someone at my door
[03:55.98]You come to my head
[03:59.02]Cos it's where my heart belongs
[04:09.35]You come to my head
[04:12.84]Cos it's where my heart belongs
[04:20.65]
