[00:16.11]The clock is ticking on the table in my room.
[00:22.33]Funny how the time just slips away.
[00:28.08]An ordinary simple man
[00:31.18]Who's lost a little piece of something.
[00:34.52]Hold my breath and close my eyes.
[00:37.42]Say a little prayer.
[00:39.35]
[00:40.59]Here we go again hello.
[00:46.54]I didn't see the end and so the story goes.
[00:52.86]How can I be cool?
[00:55.68]I always play the fool!
[00:58.77]I need a shot of love.
[01:00.26]Like an arrow through the heart.
[01:03.53]
[01:05.89]My mind is open to the page of yesterday.
[01:11.59]Isn't it a crime how love can go.
[01:17.29]I always knew there would come a day
[01:20.37]When silence played the king of pain.
[01:23.38]So I close my eyes and hold my breath.
[01:26.42]And contemplate a change.
[01:28.56]
[01:29.55]Here we go again hello.
[01:35.78]I didn't see the end and so the story goes.
[01:42.04]How can I be cool?
[01:44.81]I always play the fool!
[01:47.97]I need a shot of love.
[01:49.67]Like an arrow throuth the heart.
[02:00.73]
[02:01.13]I have my faith in life.
[02:04.06]I know the truth inside.
[02:08.27]This time I swear it's gonna be better
[02:31.36]Hold my breath and close my eyes.
[02:37.32]Here we go again hello.
[02:43.34]I didn't see the end and so the story goes.
[02:49.66]How can I be cool?
[02:52.53]I always play the fool!
[02:55.35]I need a shot of love.
[02:56.99]Like an arrow through the heart.
[02:58.90]Here we go again hello.
[03:11.13]How can I be cool?
[03:14.03]I always play the fool!
[03:17.07]I need a shot of love.
[03:18.67]Like an arrow throuth the heart.
[03:24.52]The clock is ticking on the table in my room.
