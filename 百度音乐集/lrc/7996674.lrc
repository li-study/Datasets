[00:30.21]Can you remember
[00:32.96]Remember my name
[00:37.10]As I flow through your life
[00:41.57]A thousand oceans I have flown
[00:45.57]Ooooh and cold
[00:50.53]Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)
[00:57.59]All my life
[01:01.49]I am the echo of your past
[01:09.93]
[01:14.65]I am returning
[01:16.93]The echo of a point in time
[01:21.18]In distant faces shine
[01:25.53]A thousand warriors I have known
[01:29.44]Ooooh and laughing
[01:34.62]As the spirits appear
[01:39.07]Ooooh all your life
[01:45.65]Shadows of another day
[01:51.82]
[01:52.40]And if you hear me talking on the wind
[01:55.59]You've got to understand
[01:57.57]We must remain
[01:59.91]Perfect strangers
[02:02.81]
[02:04.90]Oooooh ooh
[02:12.87]
[02:31.00]I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
[02:38.36]Oh
[02:39.29]
[02:43.85]A strand of silver
[02:46.64]Hanging through the sky
[02:50.56]Touching more than you see
[02:54.78]The voice of ages in your mind
[02:58.96]Ooooh is aching
[03:03.91]With the dead of the night
[03:08.33]Precious life
[03:14.94]Your tears are lost in falling rain
[03:21.18]
[03:21.66]And if you hear me talking on the wind
[03:24.76]You've got to understand
[03:26.78]We must remain
[03:29.25]Perfect strangers
[03:32.61]
