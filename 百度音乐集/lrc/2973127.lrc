[00:-2.00] Happier
[00:-1.00]A Fine Frenzy

[00:21.10]
[00:23.09]Quick kid quick, so harsh and cynical
[00:26.37]Touches stricken, cold and clinical
[00:29.75]What a transformation to behold
[00:34.33]But I don't like this new, I want the old
[00:38.59]
[00:39.72]It's not the words that make it final
[00:42.78]You've said such things before to rival them
[00:46.47]But it's how you say 'em now that's changed
[00:51.06]
[00:52.85]Cold but sympathetic all the same
[00:57.35]
[00:59.88]Lie to convince me
[01:03.38]That I'll be better off
[01:06.03]Oh, you go on and I'll be happier,
[01:11.30]I'll be happier you go on, yeah, you go on
[01:16.41]You'll be gone and I'll be happier
[01:20.42]
[01:23.00]Shoot me with your rubber bullets
[01:26.08]Your finger's on the trigger, pull it
[01:29.37]I know you want this suffering to end
[01:34.06]
[01:36.20]So it is forgivable my friend
[01:40.47]
[01:43.22]It's all to convince me
[01:46.73]That I'll be better off
[01:49.23]So you go on and I'll be happier,
[01:53.12]You go on and I'll be happier
[01:56.45]You go on, yeah, you go on
[01:59.70]You'll be gone and I'll be happier
[02:03.19]
[02:04.13]Bo-bo-ba-do-bo
[02:07.28]Bo-bo-ba-do-bo-da-da-da
[02:10.82]
[02:17.79]Say what you mean, what you mean
[02:22.09]Cause you'll be happier without me,
[02:25.58]Without me, without me, oh
[02:31.77]
[02:39.90]You won't convince me,
[02:43.37]That I'll be better off
[02:45.99]So you go on and I'll be happier,
[02:51.25]I'll be happier you go on, you go
[02:56.26]You'll be gone, and I'll be gone
[02:59.57]You go on and I'll be happier,
[03:03.11]You go on and I'll be happier,
[03:06.48]You go on, you go on,
[03:09.74]You go on and I'll go on
[03:12.83]And I'll be happier
[03:14.79]You on and I'll be happier,
[03:18.06]You go on and I'll be happier
[03:21.50]You go on, and I'll be happier
[03:25.37]
