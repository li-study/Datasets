[03:06.16][00:02.00]No Place That Far
[03:08.59][00:05.60]
[00:07.37]I can't imagine any greater fear
[00:14.63]Than waking up without you here
[00:22.34]And though the sun would still shine on
[00:29.15]My whole world would all be gone
[00:36.30]But not for long'
[02:27.42][00:39.69]If I had to run
[02:28.23][00:43.23]If I had to crawl
[02:29.85][00:46.81]If I had to swim a hundred rivers
[02:35.97][00:51.30]Just to climb a thousand walls
[02:39.58][00:54.88]Always know that I would find a way
[02:43.38][00:58.67]To get to where you are
[02:46.73][01:02.17]There's no place that far
[01:12.24]It wouldn't matter why we're apart
[01:19.76]Lonely months, two stubborn hearts
[01:26.94]Nothing short of God above
[01:33.77]Could turn me away from your love
[01:40.91]I need you that much
[01:44.60]If I had to run
[01:48.21]If I had to crawl
[01:51.75]If I had to swim a hundred rivers
[01:56.20]Just to climb a thousand walls
[01:59.82]Always know that I would find a way
[02:03.56]To get to where you are
[02:59.05][02:07.07]There's no place that far
