[00:02.00]Annie Lennox
[00:03.00]
[00:04.59]Come into these arms again
[00:11.93]And lay your body down
[00:18.59]
[00:21.36]Th' rhythm of this trembling heart
[00:27.56]Is beating like a drum.
[00:35.63]It beats for you, it bleeds for you
[00:43.15]It knows not how it sounds.
[00:53.10]For it is the drum of drums
[00:59.70]It is the song of songs.
[01:07.22]
[01:08.77]Once I had the rarest rose that
[01:15.82]ever deigned to bloom.
[01:22.29]
[01:25.45]Cruel winter chilled the balm,
[01:31.28]And stole my flower too soon
[01:39.35]O loneliness, O hopelessness
[01:47.71]To search the ends of time,
[01:57.55]For there is in all the world
[02:03.82]No greater love than mine.
[02:11.09]
[02:15.76]Love....Still falls the rain.
[02:37.23]Be mine forever...
[02:44.13]
[02:50.20]Let me be the only one
[02:57.51]To keep you from the cold.
[03:05.39]Now the floor of heav'n is laid,
[03:13.31]Its stars of brightest glow.
[03:21.21]They shine for you.
[03:25.11]They shine for you.
[03:29.52]They burn for all to see.
[03:39.22]Come into these arms again
[03:45.93]And set this spirit free.
[03:55.93]
