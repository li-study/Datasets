[00:00.10]John Mayer - My Stupid Mouth
[00:08.20]
[00:10.41]My stupid mouth
[00:12.59]Has got me in trouble
[00:14.51]I said too much again
[00:17.57]To a date over dinner yesterday
[00:21.26]And I could see
[00:23.28]She was offended
[00:25.38]She said "well anyway..."
[00:28.41]Just dying for a subject change
[00:31.53]
[00:32.99]Oh, another social casualty
[00:40.59]Score one more for me
[00:44.55]How could I forget?
[00:46.48]Mama said "think before speaking"
[00:49.36]No filter in my head
[00:51.29]Oh, what's a boy to do
[00:54.37]I guess her better find one soon
[00:59.69]
[01:06.64]We bit our lips
[01:08.84]She looked out the window
[01:10.80]Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
[01:13.97]I played a quick game of chess
[01:15.63]With the salt and pepper shaker
[01:19.74]And I could see clearly
[01:21.57]An indelible line was drawn
[01:24.74]Between what was good
[01:26.23]What just slipped out and what went wrong
[01:29.23]Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
[01:37.10]Thanks for playing, try again.
[01:40.34]How could I forget?
[01:42.98]Mama said "think before speaking"
[01:45.71]No filter in my head
[01:47.79]Oh, what's a boy to do
[01:50.75]I guess he better find one
[01:53.70]I'm never speaking up again
[01:59.26]It only hurts me
[02:04.67]I'd rather be a mystery
[02:09.87]Than she desert me
[02:13.94]
[02:15.06]Oh I'm never speaking up again
[02:19.48]Starting now
[02:25.20]Starting now
[02:31.18]
[02:34.40]One more thing
[02:36.26]Why is it my fault?
[02:38.26]So maybe I try too hard
[02:41.33]But it's all because of this desire
[02:44.70]I just wanna be liked
[02:46.88]I just wanna be funny
[02:49.03]Looks like the jokes on me
[02:52.18]So call me captain backfire
[02:56.60]I'm never speaking up again
[03:02.37]It only hurts me
[03:07.72]I'd rather be a mystery
[03:12.94]Than she desert me
[03:18.25]Oh I'm never speaking up again
[03:21.03]I'm never speaking up again
[03:23.69]I'm never speaking up again
[03:27.03]
[03:28.11]Starting now
[03:33.36]Starting now
