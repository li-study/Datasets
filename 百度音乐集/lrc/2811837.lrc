[00:08.81]Love,
[00:10.43]I'm aching to believe
[00:14.60]give me something real enough
[00:19.22]give me somewhere to fall from
[00:22.32]
[00:23.63]'cause in the dark
[00:26.82]I can't find my feet
[00:30.73]built my world on promises
[00:34.95]colorless and cold
[00:37.54]
[00:41.22]I'm short of breath, I'm sure
[00:44.43]gone, let it wash away the best I had
[00:52.80]gone, and when I disappear
[00:56.91]don't expect me back, don't expect me back
[01:04.14]
[01:11.19]Lost, sweetest things get lost
[01:17.21]in the static far away
[01:21.10]painted pictures of you
[01:26.63]I fold
[01:29.57]don't want to be holy then
[01:33.41]don't want to be sold again
[01:36.96]the way I was with you with you
[01:43.69]
[01:44.11]I'm short of breath, I'm sure
[01:47.41]gone let it wash away the best I had
[01:55.31]gone and when I disappear
[01:59.48]don't expect me back,
[02:03.37]don't expect me back
[02:06.79]
[02:09.03]at its worse the heart is sober
[02:16.99]at its worse the heart is cold, cold, cold
[02:23.44]
[02:40.04]gone, let it wash away
[02:43.59]the best I had
[02:47.62]gone, and when I disappear
[02:51.72]don't expect me
[02:54.39]don't expect me back
[02:55.98]gone, let it wash away
[02:59.77]the best I had
[03:03.96]gone, and when I disappear
[03:08.05]don't expect me back
[03:12.06]don't expect me back
[03:16.07]don't expect me back
[03:19.69]
