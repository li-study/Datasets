[00:00.80]Superwoman
[00:06.10]——Alicia Keys
[00:12.38]
[00:25.39]Everywhere I’m turning
[00:31.24]Nothing seems complete
[00:37.01]I stand up and I’m searching
[00:42.75]For the better part of me
[00:48.87]I hang my head from sorrow
[00:55.01]Slave to humanity
[01:00.71]I wear it on my shoulders
[01:05.05]Gotta find the strength in me
[01:09.93]
[01:10.84]Cause I am a Superwoman
[01:17.22]Yes I am
[01:19.97]Yes she is
[01:23.13]Even when I’m a mess
[01:25.05]I still put on a vest
[01:26.32]With an S on my chest
[01:27.79]Oh yes
[01:28.87]I’m a Superwoman
[01:33.12]
[01:34.56]For all the mothers fighting
[01:42.14]For better days to come
[01:47.93]And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
[01:53.64]To come home before the sun
[01:59.75]And all my sisters
[02:01.25]Coming together
[02:04.43]Say yes I will
[02:07.58]Yes I can
[02:09.70]
[02:10.22]Cause I am a Superwoman
[02:16.57]Yes I am
[02:19.42]Yes she is
[02:22.39]Even when I’m a mess
[02:24.10]I still put on a vest
[02:25.48]With an S on my chest
[02:26.99]Oh yes
[02:28.01]I’m a Superwoman
[02:31.30]
[02:33.87]When I’m breaking down
[02:36.58]And I can’t be found
[02:40.06]And I start to get weak
[02:45.97]Cause no one knows
[02:48.43]Me underneath these clothes
[02:51.90]But I can fly
[02:58.22]We can fly, Oooohh
[03:03.58]
[03:03.91]Cause I am a Superwoman
[03:09.90]Yes I am
[03:12.75]Yes she is
[03:15.57]Even when I’m a mess
[03:17.46]I still put on a vest
[03:18.88]With an S on my chest
[03:20.39]Oh yes
[03:21.55]I’m a Superwoman
[03:25.05]
