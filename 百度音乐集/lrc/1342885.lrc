[00:58.31]Why, tell me the reasons why
[01:09.37]Try, still I don't understand
[01:20.90]Will I ever feel this again
[01:32.09]Blue sky, I'll meet you in the end
[01:43.45]Free them, free the memories of you
[01:54.81]Free me, and rest 'til I'm with you
[02:04.98]
[02:07.63]A day like today
[02:11.61]My whole world has been changed
[02:21.53]Nothing you say
[02:25.65]Will help ease my pain
[02:32.28]
[02:48.59]Turn, I'll turn this slowly round
[03:00.00]Burn, burn to feel alive again
[03:11.17]She, she'd want me to move on
[03:22.36]See me, this place I still belong
[03:35.42]Give chase, to find more than I have found
[03:46.77]And face, this time now on my own
[03:55.24]
[03:58.03]Days disappear
[04:01.88]And my world keeps changing
[04:11.85]I feel you here
[04:15.63]And it keeps me sane
[04:22.20]
[04:28.47]So I'm moving on
[04:32.78]I'll never forget
[04:36.18]As you lay there and watched me
[04:42.29]Accepting the end
[04:46.02]I knew you were scared
[04:49.53]You were strong I was trying
[04:55.72]I gave you my hand
[04:58.99]I said it's okay letting go time to leave here
[05:09.35]And I'll carry on
[05:12.56]The best that I can without you here beside me
[05:23.00]Let him come take you home
[05:31.95]
