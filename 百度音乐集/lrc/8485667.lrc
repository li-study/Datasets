[00:10.20]What did you do? What did you say?
[00:12.78]Did you walk - or did you run away?
[00:15.66]Where are you now? Where have you been?
[00:18.22]Did you go alone - or did you bring a friend?
[00:21.18]I need to know this - cause I notice when you're smilin'
[00:26.69]Out in the sun havin' fun and you're feelin' free
[00:32.43]And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
[00:36.78]But you keep on smilin' for me
[00:39.94]
[00:43.28]What went right? What went wrong?
[00:45.85]Was it the story - or was it the song?
[00:48.62]Was it overnight - or did it take you long?
[00:51.34]Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?
[00:54.47]Or all the above - oh how I love to see you smilin'
[00:59.98]And oh yeah - take a little pain just in case
[01:06.60]You need something warm to embrace
[01:09.63]To help you put on a smilin' face
[01:13.73]Hey, put on a smilin' face
[01:17.57]Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
[01:22.73]Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
[01:28.33]Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
[01:33.88]But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time
[01:38.15]
[02:00.70]I want to be you - whenever I see you smilin'
[02:06.13]Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
[02:12.76]Your worries and fears become your friends
[02:15.82]And they end up smilin' at you
[02:22.23]Put on a smilin' face
[02:26.92]
