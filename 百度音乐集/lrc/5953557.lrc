[00:38.10]Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
[00:41.55]Motivate your anger to make them realize
[00:44.98]Climbing the mountain. Never coming down?
[00:48.45]Break in to the contents. Never falling down
[00:51.82][00:56.60]
[00:58.60]My knee is still shaking like I was twelve
[01:02.10]Sneaking out the class room by the back door
[01:05.54]A man railed at me twice but I didn't care
[01:09.00]Waiting is wasting for people like me
[01:26.09][01:12.42][03:05.24][02:51.61][02:21.73]Don't try to live so wise.
[01:29.55][01:15.84][03:08.65][02:54.98][02:25.09]Don't cry coz you're so right.
[01:33.01][01:19.25][03:12.07][02:58.40][02:28.53]Don't dry with fakes or fears.
[01:36.32][01:22.58][03:15.43][03:01.66][02:31.90]Coz you will hate yourself in the end.
[01:40.14]You say "dreams are dreams."
[01:43.65]I ain't gonnaplay the fool anymore.
[01:50.50]You say "coz I still got my soul."
[01:54.24]Take your time baby your blood needs to slow down.
[01:57.71]"Breach your soul." "Reach yourself before you gloom."
[02:01.05]Reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing.
[02:08.27][02:12.70]
[02:14.70]You still are blind if you see the winding road.
[02:17.98]Coz there is always a straight way to the point you see
[02:49.61][02:34.96]
