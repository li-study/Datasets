[00:30.28]When moonlight crawls along the street
[00:33.35]Chasing away the summer heat
[00:36.61]Footsteps outside somewhere below
[00:39.98]The world revolves I let it go
[00:43.34]We build our church above this street
[00:46.58]We practice love between these sheets
[00:49.95]The candy sweetness scent of you
[00:53.33]It bathes my skin I'm stained by you
[00:57.63]And all I have to do is hold you
[01:00.57]There's a racing in my heart
[01:04.52]I am barely touching you
[01:07.93]
[01:10.04]Turn the lights down low
[01:11.57]Take it off
[01:12.55]Let me show
[01:13.41]My love for you
[01:14.82]Insatiable
[01:16.56]Turn me on
[01:17.38]Never stop
[01:18.25]Wanna taste every drop
[01:19.80]My love for you
[01:21.27]Insatiable
[01:23.07]
[01:36.45]The moonlight plays upon your skin
[01:39.75]A kiss that lingers takes me in
[01:42.84]I fall asleep inside of you
[01:46.23]There are no words
[01:48.53]There's only truth
[01:49.91]Breathe in Breathe out
[01:51.52]There is no sound
[01:52.92]We move together up and down
[01:56.04]We levitate our bodies soar
[01:59.38]Our feet don't even touch the floor
[02:03.84]And nobody knows you like I do
[02:07.42]The world doesn't understand
[02:09.75]But I grow stronger in your hands
[02:14.49]
[02:16.38]Turn the lights down low
[02:17.93]Take it off

[02:41.90]Insatiable
[02:43.89]
[02:50.26]We never sleep we're always holdin' hands
[02:54.65]Kissin' for hours talkin' makin' plans
[02:59.18]I feel like a better man
[03:02.07]Just being in the same room
[03:04.17]We never sleep there's just so much to do
[03:08.07]Too much to say
[03:09.54]Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
[03:12.16]Insatiable the way I'm loving you
[03:17.04]
