To those who hate
Have cried for noone
You can call
You can call
Broadcast
To those who talk
And wish against me
You can call
You can call
Late in the evening when it gets dark
You can call
They go unbeaten
You can fall
You can fall
To those who say
It's because they're weak
You can fall
You can fall
Late in the evening when it gets dark
You can fall
