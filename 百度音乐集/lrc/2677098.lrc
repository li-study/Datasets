[00:11.37]Born with the moon in Cancer
[00:19.81]Choose her a name she\'ll answer too
[00:26.43]Call her green and the winters can not fade her
[00:30.86]Call her green for the children who have made her
[00:35.66]Little, green, be a gypsy dancer
[00:43.67]
[00:46.15]He went to California
[00:54.71]Hearing that everything\'s warmer there
[01:00.85]So you write him a letter, say, \"her eyes are blue\"
[01:05.91]He sends you a poem and she\'s lost to you
[01:11.47]Little, green, he\'s a non-comformer
[01:17.39]
[01:18.18]Just a little green
[01:21.14]Like the color when the spring is born
[01:27.09]There\'ll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
[01:34.75]Just a little green
[01:37.82]Like the night\'s when the Northern lights perform
[01:44.42]There\'ll be icicles and birthday clothes
[01:49.13]And sometimes there\'ll be sorrow
[01:57.03]
[01:57.97]Child with a child pretending
[02:05.40]Weary of lies you\'re sending home
[02:11.70]So you sign all the papers in the family name
[02:17.61]You\'re sad and you\'re sorry but you\'re not ashamed
[02:21.61]Little green, have a happy ending
[02:27.67]
[02:28.46]Just a little green
[02:31.06]Like the color when the spring is born
[02:37.39]There\'ll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
[02:45.05]Just a little green
[02:47.94]Like the night\'s when the Northern lights perform
[02:54.37]There\'ll be icicles and birthday clothes
[02:58.83]And sometimes there\'ll be sorrow
[03:10.88]
