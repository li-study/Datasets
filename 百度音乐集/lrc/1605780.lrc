[00:02.00]An Angel
[00:05.00]Declan Galbraith
[00:08.00]
[00:11.09]I wish I had your pair of wings
[00:16.87]Had them last in my dreams
[00:22.89]I was chaising butterflies
[00:28.80]Till the sunrise broke my eyes
[00:33.49]
[00:34.76]Tonight the sky has glued my eyes
[00:40.73]Cause what they see's an angel hive
[00:46.81]I've got to touch that magic star
[00:52.85]And greet the angels in their hive
[00:57.03]
[00:57.24]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[01:03.27]Sometimes I wish I were you
[01:09.21]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[01:15.36]Sometimes I wish I were you
[01:20.83]
[01:23.01]And all the sweet honey from above
[01:28.62]Pour it all over me sweet love
[01:34.91]And while you're flying around my head
[01:40.77]Your honey kisses keep me fed
[01:44.98]
[01:46.81]I wish I had your pair of wings
[01:52.88]Just like last night in my dreams
[01:58.80]I was lost in paradise
[02:04.81]Wish I'd never opened my eyes
[02:09.26]
[02:09.52]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[02:15.28]Sometimes I wish I were you
[02:21.26]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[02:27.32]Sometimes I wish I were you
[02:32.92]
[02:33.37]But there's danger in the air
[02:38.94]Tryin' so hard to be unfair
[02:46.03]Danger's in the air
[02:50.90]Tryin' so hard to give us a scare
[02:56.12]But were not afraid
[03:03.20]
[03:03.41]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[03:09.25]Sometimes I wish I were you
[03:15.27]Sometimes I wish I were an angel
[03:21.29]Sometimes I wish I were you
[03:26.58]Wish I were you
[03:31.04]Oh I wish I were you
