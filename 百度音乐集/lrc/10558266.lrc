[00:04.93]Jamaica Farewell - Harry Belafonte
[00:05.55]
[00:14.03]Down the way where the nights are gay
[00:16.31]And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
[00:20.70]I took a trip on a sailing ship
[00:23.37]But when i reached jamaica i made her stop
[00:26.77]
[00:27.01]Chorus:Now i'm sad to say
[00:29.10]I'm on my way (on my way)
[00:31.21]I won't be back for many a day
[00:33.94]My heart is down
[00:35.32]My head is turning around
[00:36.55]I had to leave a little girl in kingston town
[00:43.66]
[00:54.36]Sounds of laughter everywhere
[00:57.06]And the dancing girls sway to and fro
[01:00.86]I must declare my heart is there
[01:03.73]Though i have been from maine to mexico
[01:07.00]
[01:07.30]Chorus:Still i'm sad to say
[01:09.19]I'm on my way (on my way)
[01:11.20]I won't be back for many a day
[01:14.10]My heart is down
[01:15.76]My head is turning around
[01:18.17]I had to leave a little girl in kingston town
[01:34.40]Down at the market you can hear
[01:34.66]
[01:36.82]Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
[01:40.86]Ackev rice, salt fish are nice
[01:43.27]Oh the rum is fine anytime of year
[01:46.63]
[01:46.86]Chorus:Now i'm sad to say
[01:48.80]I'm on my way (on my way)
[01:51.42]I won't be back for many a day
[01:53.50]My heart is down
[01:54.77]My head is turning around
[01:56.51]I had to leave a little girl in kingston town
[02:01.45]
[02:14.03]Down the way where the nights are gay
[02:16.40]And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
[02:20.40]I took a trip on a sailing ship
[02:23.06]But when i reached jamaica i made her stop
[02:26.56]
[02:26.79]Chorus:Now i'm sad to say
[02:28.56]I'm on my way (on my way)
[02:30.39]I won't be back for many a day
[02:33.22]My heart is down
[02:34.42]My head is turning around
[02:36.13]I had to leave a little girl in kingston town
[02:40.02]
[02:40.55]Chorus:Now i'm sad to say
[02:41.53]I'm on my way (on my way)
[02:43.62]I won't be back for many a day
[02:46.41]My heart is down
[02:47.61]My head is turning around
[02:49.32]I had to leave a little girl in kingston town
[02:54.41]
[02:55.41]南太平洋的海水泛着深蓝，而我即将要赶向那波浪的更深更蓝处。
[02:56.41]亲爱的姑娘，我回望那夕阳中温柔起伏的群山，泪水流下了我的双颊。
[02:57.00]因为我知道再没有机会回到这个不属于我的小岛。
[02:57.50]我只是个匆匆的过客，你亦有自己的生活。
[02:58.00]也许是天定此劫，让我的小船停靠在牙买加，让我在这个陌生的异地遇见了你。
[02:58.50]人生就是不断的相遇，注定相见就不必回避。
[02:59.00]请记住所有属于我们两的欢乐，忘却一切的不愉快吧！
[02:59.50]人生本来短暂，何必再让昨日的苦恼烦扰未来？
[03:00.00]我们能微笑着相见，应该也能够微笑着说再见，微笑着永不回头。
[03:00.50]我只是一株没有根的行走的草，替自己在荒原招魂。
[03:01.00]请原谅我这样的悄然离去，因为一个没有未来的游子，如何能承诺另一个人的未来？
[03:01.50]在金斯顿港的岸边，请用海水寄给我一个微笑吧，让我相信我也有能力给别人带来快乐。
[03:02.00]然后我会回望，回望那夕阳中温柔起伏的群山，回望所有已化尘土的岁月，
[03:02.50]放纵的让泪水洗涤自己的双眼，然后，微笑，然后转身离去。
[03:03.50]Farewell Jamaica！Farewell my love！
