[00:02.00]"Listen To Your Heart"
[00:21.00]I know there's something in the wake of your smile.
[00:27.00]I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.
[00:34.00]You've built a love but that love falls apart.
[00:38.00]Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.
[03:10.00][02:46.00][01:39.00][00:44.00]Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.
[03:14.00][02:51.00][01:45.00][00:49.00]Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.
[03:19.00][02:56.00][01:50.00][00:54.00]I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,
[03:25.00][03:03.00][01:56.00][01:00.00]but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.
[01:18.00]Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.
[01:23.00]The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
[01:29.00]They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
[01:34.00]the feeling of belonging to your dreams.
[02:25.00]And there are voices that want to be heard.
[02:30.00]So much to mention but you can't find the words.
[02:35.00]The scent of magic, the beauty that's been when love was wilder than the wind.
