[00:05.55]Nobody's Home
[00:12.72]
[00:21.17]I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,
[00:27.22]She felt it everyday.
[00:31.54]And I couldn't help her,
[00:34.34]I just watched her make the same mistakes again.
[00:40.64]
[00:40.83]What's wrong, what's wrong now?
[00:43.34]Too many, too many problems.
[00:45.98]Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
[00:51.76]
[02:42.97][01:44.05][00:52.16]She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
[02:42.98][01:46.56][00:57.25]It's where she lies, broken inside.
[02:43.65][01:54.24][01:02.10]With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
[02:51.25][02:01.98][01:09.73]Broken inside.
[02:53.12][02:04.02][01:11.83]
[01:12.90]Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.
[01:23.19]You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.
[01:32.69]Be strong, be strong now.
[01:35.32]Too many, too many problems.
[01:37.83]Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
[01:43.42]
[02:07.08]Her feelings she hides.
[02:09.33]Her dreams she can't find.
[02:11.84]She's losing her mind.
[02:14.48]She's fallen behind.
[02:17.08]She can't find her place.
[02:19.49]She's losing her faith.
[02:22.14]She's fallen from grace.
[02:24.92]She's all over the place.
[02:29.24]Yeah,oh
[02:32.14]
[02:53.60]She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
[03:03.80]She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
