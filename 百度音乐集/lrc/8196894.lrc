[00:21.06]Like a bird on the wire
[00:26.32]like a drunk in a midnight choir
[00:31.29]I have tried in my way to be free.
[00:41.21]Like a fish on a hook
[00:46.17]like a knight from an old fashioned book
[00:50.97]I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
[01:01.49]If I have been unkind, umm...
[01:11.29]I hope that you could just let it go by. Oh, let it go by.
[01:21.24]And if I have been untrue
[01:31.04]I hope you know it was never to you. No, no,oh
[01:40.95]Like a baby, stillborn
[01:45.65]like a beast with his horn
[01:50.59]I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
[02:00.54]But I swear by this song
[02:05.88]By all I have done wrong
[02:11.02]I'll make it all up to you. Yes I will
[02:21.13]I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch, umm--
[02:30.78]He called out to me, Don't ask for so much.
[02:40.92]And a young man leaning on his darkened door
[02:50.58]He cried out to me, Hey, why not ask for more? umm
[03:00.45]Like a bird on the wire
[03:05.54]Like a drunk in a midnight choir
[03:10.22]I have tried in my way to be free.
[03:20.52]umm... ....
