[00:01.12]Kelly Clarkson - Impossible
[00:07.10]
[00:24.68]Just woke up and thought I'd try
[00:27.59]Try to step across the line
[00:30.58]You know that I've been thinking about it for a while, yeah
[00:36.60]Starting to think it's time I leave
[00:39.61]Does me good to know I finally feel
[00:43.18]I feel this pain, it's real, it's possible
[00:47.44]
[00:47.75]You say can't change the winds
[00:51.66]You say won't matter anyway
[00:54.58]Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
[01:00.78]Can't rise above this place
[01:03.70]Won't change your mind, so I pray
[01:06.75]Breaking the walls down to the impossible
[01:13.00]
[01:13.30]Walking by myself, I know
[01:15.51]This lonely road's becoming my new home
[01:18.98]But I don't stop, I just keep moving on and on
[01:23.55]Ain't no need to dry my eyes
[01:27.60]I haven't cried in quite some time
[01:30.60]Every day I fight it, you know it's possible
[01:35.50]
[01:35.78]You say can't change the winds
[01:39.40]You say won't matter anyway
[01:42.59]Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
[01:48.79]Can't rise above this place
[01:51.44]Won't change your mind, so I pray
[01:54.75]Breaking the walls down to the impossible
[02:00.78]
[02:01.05]Can someone tell me why it's so hard taking chances
[02:06.83]You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more
[02:12.97]I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes, yeah
[02:18.71]But I won't worry about it anymore
[02:22.36]It's impossible
[02:24.63]
[02:24.90]You say can't change the winds
[02:27.48]You say won't matter anyway
[02:30.58]Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
[02:36.76]Can't rise above this place
[02:39.69]Won't change your mind, so I pray
[02:42.76]Breaking the walls down to the impossible
[02:49.46]
[02:49.75]It's impossible to you, not impossible for me
[02:55.38]Not impossible for me
[03:00.78]Can't rise above this place
[03:03.72]Won't change your mind, so I pray
[03:06.80]Breaking the walls down to the impossible
[03:12.59]
[03:12.95]Just woke up and thought I'd try
[03:15.67]Try to step across the line
