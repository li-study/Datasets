[00:02.00]Sting - I Hung My Head
[00:07.00]
[03:41.76][00:38.73]Early one morning
[03:44.98][00:41.28]With time to kill
[00:44.14]I borrowed Jeb's rifle
[00:46.76]And sat on the hill
[00:49.47]I saw a lone rider
[04:01.32][00:52.14]Crossing the plain
[00:54.83]I drew a bead on him
[00:57.51]To practice my aim
[01:27.35][01:00.62]My brother's rifle
[01:03.03]Went off in my hand
[01:05.80]A shot rang out
[01:08.43]Across the land
[01:11.08]The horse he kept running
[01:13.75]The rider was dead
[01:22.40]I set off running
[01:24.63]To wake from the dream
[01:30.03]Went into the stream
[01:32.66]I kept on running
[01:35.42]Into the salt lands
[01:38.08]And that's where they found me
[01:40.75]My head in my hands
[01:43.80]The sheriff he asked me
[01:46.33]Why had I run
[01:48.97]Then it came to me
[01:51.75]Just what I had done
[01:54.33]And all for no reason
[01:56.77]Just one piece of lead
[02:32.36]Here in the courthouse
[02:34.70]The whole town is there
[02:37.44]I see the judge
[02:39.98]High up in his chair
[02:42.84]"Explain to the courtroom
[02:45.54]What went through your mind
[02:48.19]And we'll ask the jury
[02:50.90]What verdict they find"
[02:54.01]I said "I felt the power
[02:56.37]Of death over life
[02:59.13]I orphaned his children
[03:01.82]I widowed his wife
[03:04.45]I beg their forgiveness
[03:07.04]I wish I was dead"
[03:47.92]I see the gallows
[03:50.46]Up on the hill
[03:53.13]And out in the distance
[03:55.91]A trick of the brain
[03:58.54]I see a lone rider
[04:04.10]He's come to fetch me
[04:06.67]To see what they done
[04:09.32]We'll ride together
[04:12.00]'Til kingdom come
[04:14.68]I pray for God's mercy
[04:17.56]For soon I'll be dead
