[00:13.12]Never sing for my supper
[00:18.91]I never help my neighbour
[00:24.80]Never do what is proper
[00:30.09]For my share of labour.
[00:35.55]I'm a poor boy
[00:38.24]And I'm a rover
[00:41.34]Count your coins and
[00:43.93]Throw them over my shoulder
[00:48.29]I may grow older
[00:52.55]Nobody knows
[00:56.57]How cold it grows
[00:58.61]And nobody sees
[01:00.98]How shaky my knees
[01:03.83]Nobody cares
[01:06.28]How steep my stairs
[01:09.50]And nobody smiles
[01:11.90]If I cross their stiles.
[01:18.19]Oh poor boy
[01:21.65]So sorry for himself
[01:28.59]Oh poor boy
[01:32.90]So worried for his health.
[01:37.24]You may say every day
[01:40.92]Where will he stay tonight.
[01:56.46]Never know what I came for
[02:02.04]Seems that I've forgotten
[02:07.82]Never ask what I came for
[02:13.33]Or how I was begotten.
[02:18.66]I'm a poor boy
[02:21.49]And I'm a ranger
[02:24.44]Things I say
[02:26.97]May seem stranger than Sunday
[02:31.26]Changing to Monday.
[02:35.60]Nobody knows
[02:38.60]How cold it flows
[02:41.46]And nobody feels
[02:44.68]The worn down heels
[02:47.15]Nobody's eyes
[02:50.38]Make the skies
[02:53.42]Nobody spreads
[02:56.03]Their aching heads.
[03:01.44]Oh poor boy
[03:05.05]So worried for his life
[03:11.93]Oh poor boy
[03:16.21]So keen to take a wife.
[03:21.27]He's a mess but he'll say yes
[03:23.95]If you just dress in white.
[04:07.76]Nobody knows
[04:10.04]How cold it blows
[04:13.16]And nobody sees
[04:15.71]How shaky my knees
[04:18.93]Nobody cares
[04:21.52]How steep my stairs
[04:24.74]And nobody smiles
[04:27.27]If you cross their stiles.
[04:33.07]Oh poor boy
[04:36.66]So sorry for himself
[04:43.95]Oh poor boy
[04:48.18]So worried for his health.
[04:52.73]You may say every day
[04:56.24]Where will he stay tonight.
[05:12.75]Oh poor boy
[05:16.81]So worried for his life
[05:24.22]Oh poor boy
[05:28.84]So keen to take a wife.
[05:36.06]Oh poor boy
[05:40.64]So sorry for himself
[05:47.33]Oh poor boy
[05:51.76]So worried for his health
[05:58.81]Oh poor boy.
