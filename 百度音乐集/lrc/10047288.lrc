[00:20]Here is a story of hope and of glory.
[00:30]18 years old and well I fell in love.
[00:41]Where have you gone from me?
[00:45]The one that I love and see.
[00:50]We used to have a life,
[00:55]But now its all gone.
[01:15][01:12][01:10][01:07][01:05][01:02][01:00][00:58]Mystified.
[01:19]Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?
[01:24]Does it have to be so cold in Ireland, for me?
[01:29]Are they waiting for me?
[01:31]Are they waiting for me?
[01:34]Are they waiting for me?
[01:49]Where have you gone from me?
[01:54]The one that I love and see.
[01:59]We were to have a child.
[02:04]Yesterday's gone.
[02:09]Well I knew the time would come,
[02:13]When I'd have to leave and run.
[02:19]Look what they've done to me.
[02:24]Take in my hand, it's killing me.
[02:33][02:31][02:29]Killing me.
[02:38]Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?
[02:43]Does it have to be so cold in Ireland, for me?
[02:48]Are they waiting for me, are they waiting for me,
[02:55][02:50]Are they waiting for me?
[02:57]And I'm afraid of returning to Ireland.
[03:02]I'm afraid fo returning to Ireland.
[03:06]I see that there is nothing for me.
[03:09]There is nothing for me, there is nothing for me.
