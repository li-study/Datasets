[00:37.25]
[00:48.39]It was a Saturday
[00:50.61]The last supper we had
[00:53.02]The dinner was ready
[00:54.34]but I couldn’t taste a thing (That’s for real)
[00:56.95]You said you’re gonna walk away
[00:58.85]And I could feel this pain
[01:00.65]You’ve crucified me
[01:02.87]Did you think of what we had? (No)
[01:05.12]When the bill is paid and you
[01:06.82]just walked away (头也不回)
[01:08.99]You didn’t leave me nothing
[01:10.77]but our memories (我们的回忆)
[01:13.44]Thought we were gonna be okay
[01:15.32]Make love just like old days
[01:17.42]How could you fall in love with him
[02:25.18][01:20.21]
[03:19.23]Just give me a chance
[03:22.79]Girl I’ll let you go no matter why 我还是不明白
[03:26.98]I’m everything without you
[03:29.33]Just give me a chance , once again
[03:34.79]
[02:57.77][02:25.75][01:20.77]Baby I don’t know why 我不明白 还是不明白
[03:02.58][02:30.11][01:25.04]Don’t you walk away 带走我的世界
[03:04.65][02:32.02][01:26.93]Will you think about me
[03:06.49][02:33.69][01:29.23]Girl I’ll let you go no matter why 我还是不明白
[03:10.56][02:38.10][01:32.71]I’m everything without you
[03:12.80][02:40.23][01:35.10]Just give me a chance, once again
[03:16.78][02:50.85][02:44.22][01:39.21]
[01:53.42]It was the feast of the last supper we had
[01:58.00]The cross was ready
[01:59.53]And I’m leaving it all up to you
[02:02.28]You asked me “is this me?”
[02:04.09]I knew you betrayed me
[02:06.17]There’s nothing that I could do
[02:09.77]The love is over I should carry on
[02:14.02]And I will do it for remission of the sin
[02:18.15]Thought we gonna be okay
[02:20.40]Make love just like old days
[02:22.52]How could you fall in love with him
