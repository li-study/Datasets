[00:00.00]Theres a girl
[00:03.98]Who sits under the bleachers
[00:06.63]Just another day eating alone
[00:11.05]And though she smiles
[00:14.18]There is something just hiding
[00:17.30]And she cant find a way to relate
[00:21.14]She just goes unnoticed
[00:26.10]As the crowd passes by
[00:30.81]And she'll pretend to be busy
[00:34.91]When inside she just wants to cry
[00:40.27]She'll say...
[00:44.84]Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
[00:53.64]Look a little harder, I really really want you to put yourself in her shoes
[01:02.71]Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
[01:11.07]Look a little closer and maybe then you will see why she waits for the day
[01:20.33]When you'll ask her her name
[01:25.27]
[01:31.33]The begining, in the first weeks of class
[01:34.79]She did everything to try and fit in
[01:38.26]But the others they couldnt seem to get past all the things that mismatched on the surface
[01:46.98]And she would close her eyes when they left and she fell down the stairs
[01:54.64]And the more that they joked
[01:57.39]And the more that they screamed
[01:59.54]She retreated to where she is now
[02:03.78]And she'll sing...
[02:07.10]Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
[02:13.02]Look a little harder I really really want you to put yourself in her shoes
[02:22.07]Take a little look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
[02:30.01]Look a little closer and maybe then you will see why she waits for the day that you will ask her...her name
[02:48.29]
[02:57.45]~~~Marie Digby~~~
[03:01.66]~~Miss Invisible~~
[03:05.37]
[03:13.71]And one day just the same as the last
[03:24.16]Just the days been in counting the time
[03:30.23]Came a boy that sat under the bleachers just a little bit further behind...
