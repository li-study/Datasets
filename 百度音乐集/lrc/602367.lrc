[00:02.62]Jason Derulo
[00:03.62]
[00:08.63]I met her at a bar
[00:11.57]The look she gave me said I wouldn't get far
[00:15.26]But that ain't never stop me
[00:18.21]See I like a challenge so I proceeded to speak
[00:22.57]One drink turned into two drinks
[00:25.93]Three drinks turned into dancing
[00:29.36]And pretty soon her body was all upon me
[00:32.83]When I woke up I saw her laying next to me
[00:36.72]It was just a fling
[00:40.26]But I really don't regret a thing
[00:43.59]Cause it was crazy babe
[00:47.65]And by the looks of it you feel the same
[00:51.87]And all I remember is me saying
[00:55.88]Give it to me then you came in
[00:59.67]Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
[01:04.76]I'm caught in a love hangover
[01:09.40]Love hangover, love hangover
[01:14.86]Don't you worry it's fine
[01:17.64]See this will be our little dirty secret for life
[01:21.51]Cause your man will lose his mind
[01:25.06]If he ever found out last night
[01:28.53]
[01:29.03]One drink turned into two drinks
[01:32.38]Three drinks turned into dancing
[01:35.80]And pretty soon her body was all upon me
[01:39.32]When I woke up I saw her laying next to me
[01:43.14]It was just a fling
[01:46.72]But I really don't regret a thing
[01:50.06]Cause it was crazy babe
[01:54.08]And by the looks of it you feel the same
[01:58.03]And all I remember is me saying
[02:02.33]Give it to me then you came in
[02:06.03]Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
[02:11.22]I'm caught in a love hangover
[02:14.91]
[02:15.91]Now I didn't know
[02:19.45]How far it'll go
[02:22.83]But I said I would have her
[02:26.51]Now it's the morning after
[02:30.63]
[02:31.13]It was just a fling
[02:34.85]But I really don't regret a thing
[02:38.01]Cause it was crazy babe
[02:42.09]And by the looks of it you feel the same
[02:46.10]And all I remember is me saying
[02:50.35]Give it to me then you came in
[02:53.95]Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
[02:59.17]I'm caught in a love hangover
[03:02.47]I'm caught in love hangover
[03:06.20]I'm caught in love hangover
[03:09.77]I'm caught in love hangover
[03:14.95]Love hangover..
