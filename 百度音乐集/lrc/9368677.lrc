[00:25.19]And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets
[00:35.59]And what will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
[00:41.93]And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
[00:57.04]What will happen
[00:58.68]In the morning
[00:59.80]When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
[01:10.79]Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
[01:18.95]And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
[01:27.23]And now that the family
[01:29.89]Is part of a chain
[01:33.47]Take off your eyeshade
[01:35.89]Start over again.
[02:06.90]Now take a little while to find your way in here
[02:14.72]Now take a little while to make your story clear.
[02:23.46]Now that you're lifting
[02:26.12]Your feet from the ground
[02:29.83]Weigh up your anchor
[02:32.61]And never look round.
[03:06.11]Let's sing a song
[03:08.69]For hazey jane
[03:12.20]She's back again in my mind.
[03:19.00]If songs were lines
[03:22.79]In a conversation
[03:25.10]The situation would be fine.
