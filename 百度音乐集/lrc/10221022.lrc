[00:00.00]Bon Jovi - The Radio Saved My Life Tonight
[00:03.75]Album: 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong
[00:07.44][00:16.60][04:48.75][04:52.68]
[00:19.69]I got something on my mind
[00:22.83]I’m just a little bit depressed
[00:25.66]I try to blame it on the rain
[00:28.99]But it was in my heart, I guess
[00:33.04]I’m feeling like a stranger
[00:35.96]When I drove through my hometown
[00:38.94]Past the sign that reads ‘The Boyhood Home of a Place That’s Long Gone Now’
[00:46.19]I realized ain’t nothing what it used to be
[00:52.40]Until I heard a song that takes me to my memories
[00:59.25][02:14.13][02:33.61][03:35.47][03:58.49][04:17.87]Radio saved my life tonight
[01:05.66][02:20.70]An old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
[01:12.26][02:27.16][04:11.50]I made it home by my dashboard light
[01:18.59][03:16.08][04:24.55][04:31.13][04:37.44][04:43.93]The radio saved my life tonight
[01:35.11]Just this side of morning
[01:38.32]Just this side of dawn
[01:40.63]I walked so soft into my bedroom
[01:44.04]Saw my wife sleeping alone
[01:47.55]She whispered
[01:48.54]“Baby, are you OK? Have you been gone for long?”
[01:53.61]I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close
[01:57.82]I held her all night long
[02:01.05]I tried to sleep
[02:02.64]But in my mind I heard that song
[02:07.31]Like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on
[03:22.44]The sad song that the DJ played made me feel alright
[03:28.20]As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light
[04:05.00]That old song that the DJ played made me feel alright
[04:49.19]<END>
