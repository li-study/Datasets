[00:09.14]Joe的珍藏单曲
[00:16.57]Black is the color of my true love's hair
[00:24.77]Her lips are like some roses fair
[00:33.23]She has the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.
[00:41.84]And I love the ground whereon she stands.
[00:50.30]I love my love and well she knows
[00:58.85]I love the ground whereon she goes.
[01:07.95]I whish the day it soon would come
[01:16.45]When she and I could be as one
[01:24.87]I go to the Clyde
[01:28.83]and I mourn and weep
[01:33.16]For satisfied I never can be
[01:41.54]I'll write her a letter,
[01:45.98]just a few short lines
[01:50.60]And I owe death a thousand times
[01:59.91]
[02:36.95]Black is the color of my true love's hair
[02:45.46]Her lips are like red roses fair
[02:53.63]She has the sweetestsmile
[02:57.76]and the gentlest hands.
[03:03.05]And I love the ground whereon she stands.
