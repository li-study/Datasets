
[00:01.76]I Got Mine
[00:03.93]The Black Keys
[00:05.71]
[00:32.34]I was a moving man
[00:35.43]In my younger days
[00:38.90]But I've grown out
[00:41.59]Of my rambling ways
[00:45.08]I left that road
[00:47.81]So far behind
[00:51.98]And now I know
[00:57.51]I got mine
[01:00.50]I got mine
[01:03.41]I got mine
[01:04.92]Oh baby I got mine
[01:09.29]
[01:20.98]So baby when I rolled
[01:24.31]I rolled deep
[01:27.38]So much so
[01:30.05]I couldn't get no sleep
[01:33.48]Rock and roll hustle
[01:36.82]All the time
[01:40.51]And now I know
[01:44.06]Oh baby I got mine
[01:49.08]I got mine
[01:51.88]I got mine
[01:53.39]Oh baby I got mine
[01:57.71]
[03:07.78]I got mine
[03:10.89]I got mine
[03:13.76]I got mine
[03:15.36]Oh baby I got mine
[03:19.62]
