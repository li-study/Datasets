
[00:02.29]Called Out In The Dark
[00:03.27]Snow Patrol
[00:04.55]
[00:09.19]It's like we just can't help ourselves
[00:17.24]Cos we don't know how to back down
[00:25.16]We were called out to the streets
[00:33.21]We were called into the towns
[00:38.78]
[00:41.37]And how the heavens they opened up
[00:49.21]Like arms all dazzling gold
[00:57.21]With our rain-washed histories
[01:05.14]Well we do not need to be told
[01:10.89]
[01:12.12]Show me now
[01:13.80]Show me the arms aloft
[01:16.12]Every eye trained on a different star
[01:19.91]This magic
[01:21.88]This drunken semaphore
[01:26.58]
[01:28.09]We are listening
[01:31.41]And we're not blind
[01:35.99]This is your life
[01:39.57]This is your time
[01:41.62]
[01:44.08]We are listening
[01:48.03]And we're not blind
[01:52.04]This is your life
[01:55.38]This is your time
[01:57.45]
[02:05.09]I was called out in the dark
[02:13.13]By a choir of beautiful sheets
[02:21.26]And as the kids took back the parts
[02:29.25]You and I were left with the streets
[02:35.09]
[02:36.10]Show me now
[02:37.79]Show me the arms aloft
[02:40.15]Every eye trained on a different star
[02:44.04]This magic
[02:45.86]This drunken semaphore
[02:50.48]
[02:52.04]We are listening
[02:55.26]And we're not blind
[03:00.04]This is your life
[03:03.24]This is your time
[03:05.34]
[03:08.06]We are listening
[03:11.29]And we're not blind
[03:16.06]This is your life
[03:19.18]This is your time
[03:21.64]
[03:24.10]We are listening
[03:27.84]And we're not blind
[03:32.25]This is your life
[03:35.17]This is your time
[03:37.52]
[03:39.84]We are listening
[03:43.26]And we're not blind
[03:48.24]This is your life
[03:51.75]This is your time
[03:53.40]
