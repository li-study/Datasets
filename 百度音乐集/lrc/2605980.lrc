[00:24.42]
[00:25.42]we're walking in the air
[00:29.91]we're floating in the moonlit sky
[00:36.78]the people far below
[00:38.97]are sleeping as we fly
[00:42.91]
[00:45.90]i'm holding very tight
[00:50.49]i'm riding in the midnight blue
[00:57.29]i'm finding i can fly
[00:59.64]so high above with you
[01:03.76]
[01:20.69]far across the world
[01:24.71]the villages go by like trees
[01:31.59]the rivers and the hills
[01:33.88]the forests and the streams
[01:38.11]
[01:41.15]children gaze open mouth
[01:45.63]taken by surprise
[01:50.26]nobody down below
[01:54.43]believes their eyes
[01:57.90]
[01:58.10]we're surfing in the air
[02:02.38]we're swimming in the frozen sky
[02:09.24]we're drifting over icy
[02:11.89]mountains floating by
[02:15.40]
[02:37.01]suddenly swooping
[02:41.57]low on an ocean deep
[02:46.20]arousing of
[02:48.13]a mighty monster from its sleep
[02:55.50]
[02:57.00]we're walking in the air
[03:01.42]we're floating in the midnight sky
[03:08.29]and everyone who sees
[03:10.54]us greets us as we fly
