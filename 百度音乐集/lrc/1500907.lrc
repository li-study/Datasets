[00:00.40]
[00:00.97]There's an eclipse in your eye
[00:08.35]where I used to shine
[00:14.92]Every secret untold
[00:21.57]is a planet aligned
[00:28.41]Don't need prophets or preachers
[00:31.53]to make sense of the signs
[00:34.72]when the buried and hidden
[00:37.63]can be seen by the blind
[00:40.66]
[00:41.14]You're right
[00:44.03]Some words are best unspoken
[00:47.37]So right
[00:50.21]Then it all just falls apart-
[00:56.32]the day I break your heart
[01:01.13]
[01:04.43]I caught my reflection
[01:10.87]in the corner of your eye
[01:17.49]You said don't even ask the question
[01:23.96]and I won't tell the lie
[01:30.42]When there's no accusations
[01:33.61]there's no need for denial
[01:36.61]If you hadn't heard that whisper
[01:39.44]there'd be no need to wipe tears from your eye
[01:42.75]
[01:43.07]You're right
[01:45.70]Some words are best unspoken
[01:49.22]So right
[01:51.89]Then it all just falls apart-
[01:58.40]the day I break your heart
[02:03.25]
[02:08.67]I never took no advice
[02:15.44]not the foolish not the wise
[02:21.98]all the truth that I needed
[02:28.43]was right there in your smile
[02:34.76]Every prophecy written of what's going to be
[02:40.97]All beginnings and endings
[02:43.91]they're about you and me
[02:46.31]
[02:47.08]You're right
[02:49.88]Some words are best unspoken
[02:53.39]So right
[02:56.00]Until it all just falls apart-
[02:59.45]You're right
[03:02.30]Some words are best unspoken
[03:05.79]So right
[03:08.41]Until it all just falls apart-
[03:11.83]
[03:17.14]the day I break your heart
[03:22.01]
[03:22.84]Larry Cheng & Kevin Boul, share with you!
