[00:11.00]Now let me see
[00:15.60]Where to begin
[00:19.12]You're looking well
[00:23.95]How have you been
[00:28.00]You haven't changed
[00:32.70]The hands of time
[00:36.69]Caught up with me
[00:40.00]But passed you by
[00:43.00]

[00:49.00]It was a cruel summer
[00:54.00]A cruel summer
[00:56.91]It was a cruel summer
[01:00.00]
[01:01.00]That day in May
[01:04.60]I wanted you to know
[01:08.80]You took a part of me
[01:13.00]When our hands let go
[01:16.93]But even then I knew
[01:21.70]Years would come and go
[01:25.64]You were lost to the world
[01:29.80]But I would find you though
[01:33.67]
[01:34.93]It was a cruel summer
[01:38.91]It was a cruel summer

[02:08.50]Turn the lights down low
[02:12.60]Till daylight comes again
[02:17.00]It's time to let you know
[02:21.00]This story has no end
[02:26.00]
[02:58.00]It was a cruel summer
[03:02.00]It was a cruel summer
[03:06.90]A cruel summer
[03:10.50]It was a cruel summer
