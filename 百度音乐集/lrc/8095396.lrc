[00:24.83]<I. It's Rainging>
[00:29.88]
[02:19.50]Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
[02:27.66]Under the moon, the stranger waits inside
[02:35.97]People disappear
[02:39.75]The music fades away
[02:44.07]Splashing through the rain
[02:48.20]I'll dream with them one day
[02:51.92]
[02:53.02]It's raining, raining,
[02:57.07]On the streets of New York city
[03:01.22]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[03:08.72]
[03:09.70]I may have wasted all those years
[03:13.76]They're not worth their time in tears
[03:17.86]I may have spent too long in darkness
[03:22.28]In the warmth of my fears
[03:25.87]
[03:26.44]Take a look at yourself
[03:30.53]Not at anyone else
[03:33.58]And tell me what you see
[03:41.55]I know the air is cold
[03:44.99]I know the streets are cruel
[03:47.93]But I'll enjoy the ride today
[03:53.55]
[03:55.00]It's raining, raining,
[03:59.22]On the streets of New York city
[04:03.18]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[04:10.75]Raining deep in heaven
[04:15.12]
[04:15.78]I may have wasted all those years
[04:19.93]They're not worth their time in tears
[04:23.94]I may have spent too long in darkness
[04:28.46]In the warmth of my fears
[04:31.48]
[04:32.28]As I walk through all my myths
[04:36.34]Rising and sinking like the waves
[04:40.46]With my thoughts wrapped around me
[04:44.86]Through a trial of tears
[04:54.33]
[05:33.51]Hidden by disguise, stumbling in a world
[05:40.58]Feeling uninspired, he gets into his car
[05:47.79]Not within his eyes to see, open up, open up
[05:55.31]Not much better than the man you hate
[06:01.39]
[06:13.56]<II. Deep In Heaven>
[06:15.03]Instrumental
[09:54.15]
[09:59.54]<III. The Wasteland>
[10:02.02]
[10:10.55]Still awake
[10:14.30]I continue to move along
[10:18.74]Cultivating my own nonsense
[10:26.96]Welcome to the wasteland
[10:33.88]Where you'll find ashes, nothing but ashes
[10:42.67]
[10:44.35]Still awake
[10:46.43]Bringing change, bringing movement,
[10:50.83]Bringing life
[10:52.37]A silent prayer thrown away,
[10:56.67]Disappearing in the air
[11:00.69]Rising, sinking, raining deep inside me
[11:08.01]Nowhere to turn,
[11:11.65]I look for a way back home
[11:23.90]
[11:33.38]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[11:41.53]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[11:49.78]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[11:57.99]It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
[12:14.49]
