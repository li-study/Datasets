[00:10.32]Every time I look at you
[00:11.97]You always look so beautiful
[00:14.02]Driving on the road again the Chevy’s packed
[00:17.61]And it is dusk
[00:18.72]And I will take some photographs
[00:21.04]So I can dream of you

[00:29.59]we pitch a tent & have one sleeping bag
[00:31.56]To stay away
[00:33.64]Fires burning , softly singing songs
[00:36.60]So close to you

[00:55.75]Can’t take away those times we stayed up and we talked all night
[00:59.65]Chain smoking cigarettes and three bottles of red wine
[01:03.75]Falling asleep together holding your body, close to mine
[01:04.81]
[01:10.42]Oh, And in the morning your eyes open so innocent
