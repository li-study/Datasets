[00:10.35]I can take you down to everywhere I go
[00:14.76]Never want to take you down that low
[00:18.34]Been starin' out my window
[00:22.78]Into negative space
[00:25.71]On the pavement from the elevator
[00:29.66]Down the corner shop to buy the paper
[00:33.67]Had a premonition you would be there too
[00:37.40]No way not today
[00:39.32]It's just more bad news
[00:41.60]I want to be vapor
[00:43.90]Want to rise above the year
[00:49.21]I want to be steamy
[00:51.63]And dry up all my tears
[00:56.96]Cause with my head in the clouds
[00:59.94]I'd be light upon my heels
[01:03.43]I want to be vapor
[01:06.65]I want to be vapor
[01:08.64]And disappear sometimes
[01:12.00]My heart is heavy
[01:13.21]And I feel I'm sinking in
[01:15.70]My sister tells me that I spread myself too thin
[01:19.43]Feel like I'm standing in a plaster mold of me
[01:27.37]What I have is not contagious
[01:31.16]I see a smile on a passing stranger
[01:35.10]Think to follow them to see where they go all day
[01:38.93]Wanna know how it is they get that way
[01:43.22]I want to be vapor
[01:45.55]Want to rise above the year
[01:50.66]I want to be steamy
[01:53.45]And dry up all my tears
[01:58.55]Cause with my head in the clouds
[02:01.48]I'd be light upon my heels
[02:05.21]I want to be vapor
[02:08.24]I want to be vapor
[02:10.40]And disappear sometimes
[02:32.86]I could take you down to everywhere I go
[02:37.69]But I never want to take you down that low
[02:42.33]Oh no Oh no
[02:48.70]I want to be vapor
[02:51.06]Want to rise above the year
[02:56.19]I want to be steamy
[02:58.90]And dry up all my tears
[03:04.02]Cause with my head in the clouds
[03:06.58]I'd be light upon my heels
[03:11.05]I want to be vapor
[03:22.31][03:20.34][03:13.85]I want to be vapor
[03:24.44][03:15.72]And disappear sometimes
