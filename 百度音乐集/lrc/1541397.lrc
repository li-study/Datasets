[00:07.83]Make believe
[00:11.67]If you're sick of everything
[00:15.41]All the time before us
[00:19.78]Doesn't taint my memory
[00:23.83]When the walls they put around us
[00:27.24]Can't stop what we believe
[00:31.29]When the love we share forgets us
[00:35.28]This dream will set us free
[00:40.05](So please don't tell me)
[00:44.13]Deliver me, deliver me
[00:47.87](So please don't tell me)
[00:51.72]If it's up to me, if it's up to me
[00:55.71]I've had it once and now I want it again
[01:00.85](I've had it once and now I want it again)
[01:04.51]I've had it once and now I want it again
[01:08.60](I've had it once and now I want it again)
[01:19.63]When the walls they put around us
[01:22.96]Can't stop what we believe
[01:26.80]When the love we share forgets us
[01:30.90]This dream will set us free
[01:35.20](So please don't tell me)
[01:39.93]Deliver me, deliver me
[01:43.69](So please don't tell me)
[01:47.77]If it's up to me, if it's up to me
[01:51.90]I've had it once and now I want it again
[01:55.83](I've had it once and now I want it again)
