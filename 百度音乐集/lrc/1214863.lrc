[00:17.02]Two a.m. and the rain is falling
[00:24.84]Here we are at the cross roads once again
[00:31.48]You're telling me you're so confused
[00:35.03]You can't make up your mind
[00:38.83]This is meant to be you're asking me
[00:46.00]But only love can say
[00:51.26]Try again or walk away
[00:54.85]But I believe for you and me
[00:58.63]The sun will shine one day
[01:01.59]So I'll just play me part
[01:06.54]And pray you'll have a change of heart
[01:10.39]But I can't make you see it through
[01:15.23]That's something only love can do
[01:21.70]
[01:27.49]In your arm as the dawn is breaking
[01:35.29]Face to face and a thousand mines apart
[01:41.72]I've tried my best to make you see
[01:45.50]There's hope beyond the pain
[01:49.46]If we give enough if we learn to trust
[01:56.51]But only love can say
[02:01.76]Try again or walk away
[02:05.20]But I believe for you and me
[02:09.08]The sun will shine one day
[02:12.04]So I'll just play me part
[02:16.91]And pray you'll have a change of heart
[02:21.06]But I can't make you see it through
[02:25.79]That's something only love can do

[02:44.44]I know if I could find the words
[02:48.31]To touch you deep inside
[02:52.16]You'd give our dream just one more chance
[02:56.33]Don't let this be our goodbye
[03:03.31]But only love can say
[03:08.36]Try again or walk away
[03:11.80]But I believe for you and me
[03:15.82]The sun will shine one day
[03:18.72]So I'll just play me part
[03:23.78]And pray you'll have a change of heart
