[00:09.71]"Thieves Like Us"
[00:22.84]By 电动木乃伊
[02:25.35]I've watched your face for a long time
[02:30.36]It's always the same
[02:33.96]I've studied the cracks and the wrinkles
[02:38.85]You were always so vain
[02:42.36]Well, now you live your life like a shadow
[02:46.78]In the pouring rain
[02:50.03]Oh, it's called love
[02:54.09]Yes, it's called love
[02:58.48]Oh, it's called love
[03:03.78]And it belongs to us
[03:06.84]Oh, it dies so quickly
[03:08.97]It grows so slowly
[03:11.13]But when it dies, it dies for good
[03:14.98]It's called love
[03:19.58]And it belongs to everyone but us
[03:21.29]
[03:33.14]I've lived my life in the valleys
[03:37.51]I've lived my life on the hills
[03:42.08]I've lived my life on alcohol
[03:46.14]I've lived my life on pills
[03:49.34]But it's called love
[03:53.56]And it belongs to us
[03:57.59]It's called love
[04:02.05]And it's the only thing that's worth living for
[04:06.20]It's called love
[04:10.44]And it belongs to us
[04:14.62]It's called love
[04:18.34]Yes it's called love
[04:19.97]
[04:40.19]Oh, love is found in the east and west
[04:45.00]But when love is at home, it's the best
[04:49.31]Love is the cure for every evil
[04:53.11]Love is the air that supports the eagle
[04:57.86]It's called love
[05:01.93]And it's so un-cool
[05:05.62]It's called love
[05:10.28]And somehow it's become unmentionable
[05:14.03]It's called love
[05:18.23]And it belongs to every one of us
[05:22.11]It's called love
[05:26.77]And it cuts your life like a broken knife
