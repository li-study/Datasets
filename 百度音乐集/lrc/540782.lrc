[00:01.50]Leaving
[00:04.11]Westlife
[00:05.38]
[00:17.10]Watching the clock on the wall
[00:22.33]Been a while since you called
[00:27.10]I can't help but wait
[00:29.67]It's late and I can't get no sleep
[00:33.48]
[00:35.85]Something's different this time
[00:40.30]It just doesn't feel right
[00:44.86]Have we broken in two?
[00:47.50]Am I really gonna lose you tonight?
[00:52.70]
[00:54.70]You come walking in
[00:57.16]Tears in your eyes
[00:59.61]Pretending like it's alright
[01:03.93]
[01:05.13]But I know you're leaving
[01:09.63]I know that smile
[01:13.63]I can tell you've been crying
[01:18.47]You're gonna say goodbye
[01:22.20]
[01:23.13]I wish I could stop you
[01:27.35]But you've made up your mind
[01:32.30]I beg you don't go
[01:34.50]But I already know
[01:37.35]You're leaving
[01:40.55]
[01:42.41]Where does the time go?
[01:46.10]Between goodbye and hello
[01:50.93]How did we come to this
[01:53.53]Is there something we missed along the way
[01:58.92]
[02:00.24]With your bags at the door
[02:02.91]I wanna pull you in close
[02:05.38]And hold you once more even though
[02:10.50]
[02:11.26]I know you're leaving
[02:15.58]I know that smile
[02:19.75]I can tell you've been crying
[02:24.47]You're gonna say goodbye
[02:28.59]
[02:29.35]I wish I could stop you
[02:33.51]But you've made up your mind
[02:38.28]I beg you don't go
[02:40.51]But I already know
[02:43.23]I know you're leaving
[02:46.93]
[02:47.72]Here come the sleepless nights
[02:52.03]Here come the tears I'm gonna cry
[02:56.24]Here comes the last goodbye leaving us behind
[03:01.69]Oh this can't be right
[03:05.27]
[03:08.15]I know you're leaving
[03:12.46]I know that smile
[03:16.72]I can tell you've been crying
[03:21.46]You're gonna say goodbye
[03:25.45]
[03:26.41]I wish I could stop you
[03:30.60]But you've made up your mind
[03:35.25]I beg you don't go
[03:37.58]But I already know
[03:42.03]I know you're leaving
[03:47.81]
