[00:14.75]When a child is born
[00:18.44]A ray of hope,
[00:21.65]Flickers in the sky
[00:26.55]A tiny star lights up way up high
[00:35.71]All across the land dawns a brand new more
[00:42.55]This comes to pass
[00:46.38]When a child is born
[00:51.32]The silent wish sails the seven seas
[00:59.49]The winds of change whisper in the trees
[01:08.83]And the walls of doubt crumble toss an torn
[01:15.57]This comes to pass
[01:19.62]When a child is born
[01:57.24]Itâ€™s all a dream, an illusion now,
[02:05.89]It must come true
[02:09.12]Sometime soon somehow.
[02:14.89]All across the land
[02:17.35]Dawns a brand-new morn,
[02:22.20]This comes to pass
[02:25.98]When a child is born.
[02:30.78]This comes to pass
[02:37.35]When a child is born.
