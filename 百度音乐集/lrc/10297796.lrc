[00:43.06]Here we are
[00:47.87]Out here me and you
[00:53.28]Reaching out to each other
[00:57.84]Is all that we can do
[01:02.78]Here we stand
[01:07.72]Trying not to fall
[01:12.95]There's no need to worry
[01:17.53]Love will conquer all
[01:23.11]Do you really want to know
[01:26.97]Just how long love will last
[01:31.95]Will all of the bad times pass
[01:36.99]How can we make things right
[01:43.65]Ooh and why
[01:46.74]Why is the world so unkind,
[01:51.43]We surely can find peace of mind
[01:56.03]If we only see the light, can't we see that
[02:04.07]Here we are
[02:08.94]Out here me and you
[02:14.34]Reaching out to each other
[02:18.34]Is all that we can do
[02:23.06]Ooh here we stand
[02:28.45]Trying not to fall
[02:33.79]There's no need to worry
[02:38.34]Love will conquer all
[02:44.08]Can somebody tell me why
[02:48.10]Why do our dreams go wrong
[02:52.80]Why can't we all belong
[02:57.71]Ooh, where do we start
[03:03.31]Oh and tell me when
[03:07.68]When will we ever learn
[03:12.30]There's nowhere else we can turn
[03:16.91]The truth is in our hearts, here we are together
[03:40.27]
[04:04.24]Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
[04:09.25]Sometimes the pains too much to bear
[04:14.11]Sometimes when life seems to unravel
[04:18.05]That's the time oh - to say
[04:23.47]We're gonna make it anyway
[04:29.12]Can't we see that
[04:31.13]Here we are
[04:35.81]Out here me and you
[04:41.35]Reaching out to each other
[04:45.13]Is all that we can do
[04:50.53]Here we stand
[04:55.37]Trying not to fall
[04:59.76]There's no need to worry
[05:04.63]Love will conquer all
