[00:04.24]Run Around
[00:06.10]BY:Blues Traveler -
[00:12.89]
[00:20.00]once upon a midnight dearie
[00:23.21]i woke with something in my head
[00:26.20]i couldn't escape the memory
[00:29.13]of a phone call and of what you said
[00:32.25]like a game show contestant with a parting gift
[00:35.47]i could not believe my eyes
[00:38.47]when i saw through the voice of a trusted friend
[00:41.80]who needs to humor me and tell me lies
[00:44.90]yeah humor me and tell me lies
[00:48.15]and i'll lie too and say i don't mind
[00:51.16]and as we seek so shall we find
[00:54.43]and when you're feeling open i'll still be here
[00:57.67]but not without a certain degree of fear
[01:00.88]of what will be with you and me
[01:04.00]i still can see things hopefully
[01:07.16]but you
[01:09.49]why you wanna give me a run-around
[01:13.15]is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
[01:16.51]when all it does is slow me down
[01:23.18]and shake me and my confidence
[01:26.25]about a great many things
[01:29.22]but i've been there i can see it cower
[01:32.50]like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
[01:35.51]of a bad play where the heroes are right
[01:38.42]and nobody thinks or expects too much
[01:42.02]and hollywood's calling for the movie rights
[01:45.10]singing hey babe let's keep in touch
[01:48.42]hey baby let's keep in touch
[01:51.40]but i want more than a touch i want you to reach me
[01:54.61]and show me all the things no one else can see
[01:57.69]so what you feel becomes mine as well
[02:00.95]and soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
[02:04.15]what's yours and mine the fishing's fine
[02:07.23]and it doesn't have to rhyme so don't feed me a line
[02:10.13]but you
[02:13.23]why you wanna give me a run-around
[02:16.37]is it a sure-fire wa to speed things up
[02:19.69]when all it does is slow me down
[02:26.23]SOLO^_^
[02:44.82]tra la la la la bomba dear this is the pilot speaking
[02:48.53]and i've got some news for you
[02:51.77]it seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
[02:54.65]and there ain't a whole lot that you can do
[02:57.73]oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
[03:00.76]perhaps i've grown a little cynical
[03:04.15]but i know no matter what the waitress brings
[03:07.40]i shall drink in and always be full
[03:13.46]oh i like coffee
[03:15.62]and i like tea
[03:17.07]i'd like to be able to enter a final plea
[03:19.98]i still got this dream that you just can't shake
[03:23.22]i love you to the point you can no longer take
[03:26.35]well all right okay
[03:27.48]so be that way
[03:29.77]i hope and pray
[03:31.11]that there's something left to say
[03:32.64]but you
[03:35.48]why you wanna give me a run-around
[03:38.74]is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
[03:42.15]when all it does is slow me down
[03:45.18]but you
[03:48.16]why you wanna give me a run-around
[03:51.43]is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
[03:54.91]when all it does is slow me down
