[00:09.28]Hey Maria pappa said you\'d better go to bed
[00:11.28]Maria mamma said you\'d better go to bed
[00:13.60]And little sister said you\'d better go to bed
[00:15.75]The older brother said
[00:17.18]You heard what pappa said
[00:18.02]You\'d better say goodnight
[00:19.39]You\'d better shut the light
[00:20.33]And pappa told you no,
[00:21.44]You can\'t go out tonight
[00:22.58]But pappa didn\'t know
[00:23.51]Maria had a date
[00:24.67]And couldn\'t let him wait
[00:25.93]So in a little while
[00:28.19]She waited till the lights were low
[00:30.98]She went out to the window to her beau
[00:33.93]And so...
[00:35.69]There was a lot of huggin\' and
[00:36.72]A lot of kissin\' and
[00:37.88]A lot of huggin\' and
[00:39.07]A lot of kissin\' and
[00:40.02]A lot of happy talk
[00:41.15]A lot of moon above
[00:42.25]But very little time
[00:43.65]But very little time
[00:44.46]To make a lot of love
[00:45.48]To make a lot of love
[00:46.69]Which is a normal thing
[00:47.93]To make a lot of love
[00:48.80]For it was summertime
[00:49.92]When all the crickets sing
[00:51.07]And in the summertime
[00:52.43]When anyone\'s in love
[00:54.65]The crickets sing a happy song
[00:57.24]But they didn\'t do their repertoire for long
[01:01.97]Suddenly the pappa came,
[01:03.07]And then the mamma came,
[01:04.21]And then the sister came,
