[00:01.45] Objection
[02:54.77][02:52.13][02:14.31][01:53.82][01:44.22][01:22.39][00:49.60][00:13.81][00:10.90]
[00:28.61]It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
[00:33.64]But all the damage she's caused is unfixable
[00:38.50]Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
[00:42.94]But when it comes to me you don't care
[00:46.94]If I'm alive or dead, so
[00:50.46]Chorus:
[01:10.84][00:50.95]Objection
[00:53.59]I don't want to be the exception
[00:57.73]To get a bit of your attention
[01:01.48]Love is for free and
[01:04.01]I'm not your mother
[01:07.88]But you don't even bother
[01:15.30]I'm tired of this triangle
[01:16.41]Got dizzy dancing tango
[01:18.30]I'm falling apart in your hands again
[01:19.26]No way
[01:20.68]I've got to get away
[01:25.56]Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal
[01:28.54]That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
[01:31.32]But you've got to know small things also count
[01:37.80]Better put your feet on the ground
[01:43.13]And see what it's about, so
[01:44.93]Chorus (with a slight change)
[01:45.60]… The angles of this triangle …
[01:54.40]I wish there was a chance for
[01:57.55]You and me
[02:02.94]I wish you could find our
[02:08.62]Place to be
[02:12.28]Away from here
[02:24.02]This is pathetic
[02:25.38]And sardonic
[02:26.73]And sadistic
[02:28.08]And psychotic
[02:29.56]Tango is not for fun
[02:31.40]Was never meant to be
[02:33.23]But you can try it
[02:34.77]Rehearse it
[02:37.40]Or train like a horse
[02:46.91]But don't you count on me
[02:50.55]Don't you count on me boy
[02:53.72]Chorus
