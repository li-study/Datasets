[00:05.66]Staind
[00:07.53]
[00:20.62]This is my life
[00:24.24]It's not what it was before
[00:27.37]All these feelings I've shared
[00:30.62]And these are my dreams
[00:34.51]That I'd never lived before
[00:37.55]Somebody shake me
[00:39.48]Cause I, I must be sleeping
[00:46.53]
[00:49.03]Now that we're here,
[00:51.52]It's so far away
[00:54.56]All the struggle we thought was in vain
[00:59.26]All the mistakes,
[01:01.82]One life contained
[01:04.83]They all finally start to go away
[01:09.53]Now that we're here it's so far away
[01:15.14]And I feel like I can face the day
[01:19.70]I can forgive and I'm not ashamed
[01:25.51]to be the person that I am today
[01:29.93]
[01:30.25]These are my words
[01:33.95]That I've never said before
[01:37.13]I think I'm doing ok
[01:40.58]And this is the smile
[01:44.21]That I've never shown before
[01:47.15]Somebody shake me
[01:49.09]Cause I, I must be sleeping
[01:57.11]
[01:58.52]Now that we're here,
[02:01.02]It's so far away
[02:04.10]All the struggle we thought was in vain
[02:08.74]All the mistakes,
[02:11.39]One life contained
[02:14.43]They all finally start to go away
[02:19.05]Now that we're here it's so far away
[02:24.77]And I feel like I can face the day
[02:29.45]I can forgive and I'm not ashamed
[02:35.31]to be the person that I am today
[02:40.30]
[02:42.70]I'm so afraid of waking
[02:49.22]Please don't shake me
[02:53.87]Afraid of waking
[02:59.35]Please don't shake me
[03:06.19]Now that we're here,
[03:08.52]It's so far away
[03:11.54]All the struggle we thought was in vain
[03:16.20]All the mistakes,
[03:18.94]One life contained
[03:21.90]They all finally start to go away
[03:26.58]Now that we're here it's so far away
[03:32.25]And I feel like I can face the day
[03:36.91]I can forgive and I'm not ashamed
[03:42.99]to be the person that I am today
[03:47.32]
