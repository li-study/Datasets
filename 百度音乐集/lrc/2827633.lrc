[00:13.28]Baby I′m tired of thinking I was wrong
[00:19.01]I′m lost with no sign
[00:22.31]A game with no end
[00:26.28]I′ve been there searching gold but suddenly
[00:31.93]You played with my mind
[00:35.19]Got words from behind
[00:38.38]A promise is right babe
[00:41.64]I can believe in some
[00:45.03]No win by default in your life
[00:51.25]I′m lost when you′re mindless
[00:55.11]How can I fall down
[01:02.75]Baby when your love is too far
[01:07.40]There`s no strength in my heart
[01:10.83]No will leads to distance
[01:14.05]Can you feel it now
[01:17.37]Your love is too far
[01:20.82]I swear but again
[01:23.85]The silence between us
[01:27.10]I can feel it now - ooh yeah
[01:34.28]Baby desire still relies on you
[01:39.79]Take a look at me now
[01:43.20]As it still lingers on
[01:47.21]You let my feelings grow
[01:49.91]But honestly
[01:52.91]I′m through with your game
[01:56.13]You can′t always be right
[01:59.47]A promise is sacred
[02:02.66]I can believe in some
[02:05.88]With you it’s a million to one
[02:12.43]I`m lost ′cuz you′re mindless
[02:16.11]But how can I fall down
[02:24.21]Baby when your love is too far
[02:28.63]There`s no strength in my heart
[02:31.87]No will leads to distance
[02:35.34]Can you feel it now
[02:38.29]Your love is too far
[02:41.70]I swear but again
[02:44.87]The silence between us
[02:48.06]I can feel it now - ooh yeah
[03:04.67]Maybe in another life babe -
[03:08.04]I just want it good and real
[03:11.15]So you can beg, steal or lie babe -
[03:14.12]′cuz you don’t know when
[03:17.56]Baby when your love is too far
[03:20.56]There`s no strength in my heart
[03:23.70]No will leads to distance
[03:27.19]Can you feel it now
[03:30.30]Your love is too far
[03:33.89]I swear but again
[03:36.78]The silence between us
[03:40.10]I can feel it now - ooh yeah
