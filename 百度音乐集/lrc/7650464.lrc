[00:20.01]
[00:20.29]I read you and God I'm good at it I'm so spot on
[00:30.09]Chord shapes in air go press that dissonance if you dare
[00:39.67]And you breathing in finesse an innocent
[00:47.02]From her partying
[00:48.09]
[00:49.37]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[00:54.05]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[00:59.01]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[01:03.86]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[01:08.14]'Cause I love you no?
[01:12.89]Can't help but love, you know...
[01:17.86]
[01:18.60]What part of no don't you understand I've told you before
[01:28.89]To just get off my case this isn't happening stop this now
[01:38.54]And I where was I? I have to be somewhere
[01:45.95]Now where did I put it?
[01:47.62]
[01:48.57]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[01:53.16]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[01:58.61]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[02:02.96]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[02:07.24]'Cause I love you no?
[02:12.13]Can't help but love you, no...
[02:16.33]
[02:18.75]Is this it is this it is this it?
[02:37.61]
[02:38.22]Yes hello we're back and we're taking calls
[02:45.36]Now what was the question?
[02:46.80]
[02:50.08]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[02:54.79]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[03:00.20]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[03:05.07]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[03:10.08]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[03:15.23]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[03:21.29]And I'm high enough from all the waiting
[03:24.87]To ride a wave on your inhaling
[03:29.79]'Cause I love you no?
[03:33.48]Can't help but love you, no...
[03:39.60]'Cause I love you no?
[03:43.55]Can't help but love you, no...
[03:48.64]'Cause I love you no?
[03:53.32]Can't help but love you, no...
