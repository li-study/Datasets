[00:00.00]Christina Milian - Until I Get Over You
[00:09.00]Woke up today thinking of you
[00:14.00]Another night that I made my way through
[00:19.00]So many dreams still left in my mind
[00:25.00]But they can never come true
[00:29.00]I press rewind and remember when
[00:33.00]I close my eyes and I'm with you again
[00:38.00]But in the end I can still feel the pain, every time I hear your name
[00:49.00]The sun won't shine since you went away
[00:54.00]Seems like the rain's falling every day
[00:59.00]There's just one heart, where there once was two
[01:02.00]But that's the way it's gotta be,
[01:06.00]'til I get over you
[01:18.00]Walked through the park, in the evening air
[01:24.00]I heard a voice and I thought you were there
[01:28.00]I run away but I just can't escape
[01:33.00]Memories of you everywhere
[01:38.00]They say that time will dry the tears
[01:43.00]But true love burns for a thousand years
[01:48.00]Give my tomorrows for one yesterday
[01:53.00]Just to know that I could have you here
[01:58.00]The sun won't shine since you went away
[02:03.00]Seems like the rain's falling every day
[02:08.00]There's just one heart, where there once was two
[02:12.00]But that's the way it's gotta be,
[02:15.00]'til I get over you
[02:27.00]When will this river of tears stop fallin'
[02:32.00]Where can I run so I won't feel alone
[02:37.00]Can't walk away when the pain keeps callin'
[02:42.00]I've just gotta take it from here on my own
[02:47.00]But it's so hard to let go
[03:00.00]The sun won't shine since you went away
[03:04.00]Seems like the rain's falling every day
[03:09.00]There's just one heart, where there once was two
[03:13.00]But that's the way it's gotta be,
[03:16.00]'til I get over you
[03:30.00]that's the way it's gotta be,
[03:33.00]'til I get over you
