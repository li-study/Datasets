[00:02.16]Peace
[00:05.58]Weezer
[00:08.30]
[00:12.33]More and more I can't say no
[00:17.39]So afraid of letting go
[00:22.78]If there's something I can grab
[00:28.10]You can bet I'll pay the tab
[00:36.23]Counting all the flowers
[00:40.70]Waste the precious hours
[00:46.23]I need to find some peace
[00:50.72]
[00:54.74]All these problems on my mind
[00:59.65]Make it hard for me to think
[01:05.03]There is no way I can stop
[01:10.13]My poor brain is gonna pop
[01:18.13]And I don't have a purpose
[01:23.38]Scattered on the surface
[01:28.92]I need to find some peace
[02:37.97][01:34.44]Woah......
[03:18.11][01:54.53]
[02:21.11]And all the broken tethers
[02:26.54]We can bring together
[03:35.30][03:24.90][02:31.58]I need to find some peace
[03:40.90][03:30.43]
