[00:00.00]Ours
[00:01.00]Taylor Swift
[00:05.50]
[00:12.54]Elevator buttons in morning air
[00:18.30]Strangers silence makes me wanna take the stairs
[00:24.19]If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
[00:29.86]But right now
[00:32.44]My time is theirs
[00:34.92]
[00:36.24]Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
[00:42.22]They'll judge it like they know about me and you
[00:48.04]And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
[00:53.78]The jury's out
[00:56.36]But my choice is you
[00:58.69]
[01:00.49]So don't you worry your pretty little mind
[01:03.70]People throw rocks at things that shine
[01:06.51]And life makes love look hard
[01:11.51]The stakes are high,
[01:14.64]The water's rough,
[01:17.27]But this love is ours
[01:20.21]
[01:30.41]You never know what people have up their sleeves
[01:36.45]Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
[01:42.10]Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
[01:47.83]But I don't care
[01:50.26]'Cause right now you're mine
[01:52.80]
[01:53.70]And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
[01:58.87]People throw rocks at things that shine
[02:02.01]And life makes love look hard
[02:07.09]The stakes are high,
[02:10.15]The water's rough,
[02:12.81]But this love is ours
[02:15.27]
[02:26.78]And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
[02:32.56] your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
[02:38.53] I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
[02:42.13]With this song for you
[02:44.97]
[02:54.17]'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
[03:00.10]And I love the riddles that you speak
[03:04.95]And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
[03:13.50]'Cause my heart is yours
[03:16.58]
[03:17.95]So don't you worry your pretty little mind
[03:20.97]People throw rocks at things that shine
[03:24.15]And life makes love look hard
[03:28.75]
[03:30.08]Don't you worry your pretty little mind
[03:33.24]People throw rocks at things that shine
[03:36.99]But they can't take what's ours
[03:42.87]They can't take what's ours
[03:47.04]
[03:47.96]The stakes are high,
[03:50.76]The water's rough,
[03:53.56]But this love is ours.
