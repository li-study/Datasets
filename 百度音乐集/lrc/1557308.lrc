[00:20.04]you gave to me
[00:23.70]i lost that hat
[00:27.53]long ago
[00:31.54]flew to the foggy canyon

[00:46.88]what happened to
[03:20.37][01:46.94][00:50.59]that old straw hat
[00:54.47]falling down
[00:57.90]the mountain side
[01:01.98]out of my reach
[01:04.64]like your heart
[02:43.72][01:10.30]suddenly
[02:46.44][01:12.33]that wind came up
[02:50.01][01:17.32]stealing my hat from me yeh
[02:58.28][01:24.76]swirling
[03:00.72][01:27.97]whirling gust of wind
[03:05.59][01:31.94]blowing it higher away

[03:31.91][01:58.49]but we lost it
[03:36.02][02:02.00]no one could bring it back
[03:47.22][03:39.32][02:05.75]like the life
[03:49.48][03:41.71][02:08.38]you gave me
