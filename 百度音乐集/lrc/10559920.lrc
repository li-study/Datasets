[00:00.00]The Calling - Wherever You Will Go
[00:07.67]
[00:09.67]So lately, been wondering
[00:13.90]Who will be there to take my place
[00:18.04]When I'm gone you'll need love
[00:22.27]To light the shadows on your face
[00:27.15]If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
[00:35.61]Then between the sand and stone
[00:39.57]Could you make it on your own
[00:43.16]If I could, then I would
[00:47.78]I'll go wherever you will go
[00:52.14]Way up high or down low
[00:56.43]I'll go wherever you will go
[01:01.20]And maybe, I'll find out
[01:05.01]A way to make it back someday
[01:09.29]To watch you, to guide you
[01:13.58]Through the darkest of your days
[01:18.55]If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
[01:27.14]Then I hope there's someone out there
[01:31.73]Who can bring me back to you
[01:35.11]If I could, then I would
[01:39.66]I'll go wherever you will go
[01:44.03]Way up high or down low
[01:48.34]I'll go wherever you will go
[01:53.83]
[01:54.31]Run away with my heart
[01:58.61]You run away with my hope
[02:03.03]You run away with my love
[02:08.40]
[02:10.25]I know now, just quite how
[02:14.58]My life and love might still go on
[02:18.91]In your heart, in your mind
[02:23.09]I'll stay with you for all of time
[02:27.48]If I could, then I would
[02:31.77]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:36.14]Way up high or down low
[02:40.46]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:45.00]If I could turn back time
[02:50.04]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:53.66]If I could make you mine
[02:58.72]I'll go wherever you will go
[03:07.50]I'll go wherever you will go
[03:15.46]
