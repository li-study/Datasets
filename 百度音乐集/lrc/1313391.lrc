[00:12.01]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
[00:17.26]I'll tell you that
[00:22.19]But if I didn't say it
[00:25.55]Well, I'd still have felt it
[00:28.75]Where's the sense in that?
[00:33.46]I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
[00:39.72]Or return to where we were
[00:45.32]Well I will go down with this ship
[00:49.96]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[00:55.82]There will be no white flag above my door
[01:01.85]I'm in love and always will be
[01:08.14]I know I left too much mess
[01:12.56]And destruction to come back again
[01:18.59]And I caused but nothing but trouble
[01:21.56]I understand if you can't talk to me again
[01:30.61]And if you live by the rules of "It's over"
[01:35.81]Then I'm sure that that makes sense
[01:41.97]Well I will go down with this ship
[01:46.87]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[01:52.33]There will be no white flag above my door
[01:58.19]I'm in love and always will be
[02:03.84]And when we meet
[02:06.58]As I'm sure we will
[02:09.19]All that was then
[02:12.17]Will be there still
[02:15.00]I'll let it pass
[02:17.48]And hold my tongue
[02:20.61]And you will think
[02:23.22]That I've moved on
[02:27.31]Well I will go down with this ship
[02:32.05]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[02:37.42]There will be no white flag above my door
[02:43.31]I'm in love and always will be
[02:50.47]I will go down with this ship
[02:54.64]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[02:59.86]There will be no white flag above my door
[03:05.76]I'm in love and always will be
[03:12.94]I will go down with this ship
[03:17.20]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[03:22.59]There will be no white flag above my door
[03:28.73]I'm in love and always will be
