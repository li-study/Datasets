[00:09.50]Give me back my broken night
[00:12.50]my mirrored room, my secret life
[00:15.50]it's lonely here,
[00:17.50]there's no one left to torture
[00:22.50]Give me absolute control
[00:26.50]over every living soul
[00:29.50]And lie beside me, baby,
[00:32.50]that's an order!
[00:34.50]
[00:36.50]Give me crack and anal sex
[00:39.50]Take the only tree that's left
[00:42.50]and stuff it up the hole
[00:45.50]in your culture
[00:49.50]Give me back the Berlin wall
[00:54.50]give me Stalin and St Paul
[00:56.50]I've seen the future, brother:
[00:59.50]it is murder.
[01:01.50]
[01:03.50]Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
[01:09.50]Won't be nothing
[01:11.50]Nothing you can measure anymore
[01:16.50]The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
[01:21.50]has crossed the threshold
[01:24.50]and it has overturned
[01:26.50]the order of the soul
[01:30.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[01:36.50]I wonder what they meant
[01:39.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[01:46.50]I wonder what they meant
[01:49.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[01:56.50]I wonder what they meant
[01:59.50]
[02:04.50]You don't know me from the wind
[02:07.50]you never will, you never did
[02:10.50]I'm the little jew
[02:13.50]who wrote the Bible
[02:17.50]I've seen the nations rise and fall
[02:20.50]I've heard their stories, heard them all
[02:23.50]but love's the only engine of survival
[02:31.50]Your servant here, he has been told
[02:35.50]to say it clear, to say it cold:
[02:38.50]It's over, it ain't going
[02:40.50]any further
[02:44.50]And now the wheels of heaven stop
[02:47.50]you feel the devil's riding crop
[02:51.50]Get ready for the future:
[02:54.50]it is murder
[02:56.50]
[02:58.50]Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
[03:04.50]Won't be nothing
[03:07.50]Nothing you can measure anymore
[03:11.50]The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
[03:16.50]has crossed the threshold
[03:18.50]and it has overturned
[03:20.50]the order of the soul
[03:23.50]
[03:25.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[03:31.50]I wonder what they meant
[03:35.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[03:41.50]I wonder what they meant
[03:46.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[03:52.50]I wonder what they meant
[03:55.50]
[03:58.50]There'll be the breaking of the ancient
[04:01.50]western code
[04:06.50]Your private life will suddenly explode
[04:12.50]There'll be phantoms
[04:14.50]There'll be fires on the road
[04:17.50]and the white man dancing
[04:24.50]You'll see a woman
[04:27.50]hanging upside down
[04:33.50]her features covered by her fallen gown
[04:38.50]and all the lousy little poets
[04:42.50]coming round
[04:44.50]tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
[04:52.50]and the white man dancin'
[04:54.50]
[05:01.50]Give me back the Berlin wall
[05:04.50]Give me Stalin and St Paul
[05:07.50]Give me Christ
[05:08.50]or give me Hiroshima
[05:14.50]Destroy another fetus now
[05:17.50]We don't like children anyhow
[05:21.50]I've seen the future, baby:
[05:24.50]it is murder
[05:26.50]
[05:28.50]Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
[05:33.50]Won't be nothing
[05:36.50]Nothing you can measure anymore
[05:40.50]The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
[05:45.50]has crossed the threshold
[05:48.50]and it has overturned
[05:50.50]the order of the soul
[05:54.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[06:01.50]I wonder what they meant
[06:05.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[06:11.50]I wonder what they meant
[06:14.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
[06:20.50]I wonder what they meant
[06:23.50]
[06:25.50]When they said REPENT REPENT
