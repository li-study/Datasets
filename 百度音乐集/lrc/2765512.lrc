[03:52.68][00:02.62]Oasis: Bring It On Down
[03:38.08][00:05.54]
[00:42.91]What was that sound ringing around your brain?
[00:49.06]Today was just a blur, you gotta head like a ghost train
[00:55.35]What was that sound ringing around your brain?
[01:01.71]You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?
[01:07.77]You're the outcast - you're the underclass
[01:14.07]But you don't care - because you're living fast
[01:20.01]
[01:20.74]You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
[01:24.05]I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
[01:26.95]You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
[01:29.78]I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.
[02:50.91][01:34.92]
[02:11.07][01:58.89]Bring it on down. Bring it down for me
[02:16.85][02:04.97]Your head's in a fish tank
[02:19.06][02:07.25]Your body and your mind can't breath
[02:22.63]You're the outcast - you're the underclass
[02:28.98]But you don't care - because you're living fast
[02:35.12]
[02:35.30]You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
[02:39.13]I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
[02:42.02]You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
[02:44.99]I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.
