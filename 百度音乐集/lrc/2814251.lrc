[00:00.00]
[00:22.71]I don't know much,
[00:24.25]But I know this for certain,
[00:26.71]That is the sun,
[00:28.22]Poking its head round the curtain.
[00:30.48]
[00:30.84]Now please can we leave,
[00:32.29]I'd like to go to bed now.
[00:34.92]It's not just the sun,
[00:36.32]That is hurting my head now.
[00:38.71]
[00:39.15]I'm not trying to say,
[00:40.53]That I'm smelling of roses,
[00:42.90]But when will we tire,
[00:44.53]Of putting shit up our noses.
[00:47.02]
[00:47.37]I don't like staying up,
[00:48.69]Staying up past the sunlight.
[00:51.37]It's meant to be fun,
[00:52.76]And this just doesn't feel right.
[00:55.72]
[00:56.03]Why can't we all,
[00:57.87]All just be honest,
[00:59.97]Admit to ourselves,
[01:01.56]That everyone's on it.
[01:03.39]
[01:03.85]From grown politicians,
[01:05.56]To young adolescents,
[01:07.63]Prescribing themselves,
[01:09.78]Anti-depressants.
[01:11.69]
[01:12.08]How can we start to tackle the problem,
[01:16.02]If you don't put your hands up,
[01:17.75]And admit that you're on them.
[01:19.87]
[01:20.20]The kids are in danger,
[01:22.06]They're all getting habits,
[01:24.12]Because from what I can see,
[01:26.27]Everyone's at it.
[01:30.81]Everyone's at it.
[01:34.75]Everyone's at it.
[01:38.84]Everyone's at it.
[01:40.22]
[01:45.00]I get involved,
[01:46.32]But I'm not advocating.
[01:48.76]Got an opinion,
[01:50.42]Yeah, you're well up for slating.
[01:52.55]
[01:52.95]So you've got a prescription,
[01:54.89]And that makes it legal.
[01:56.96]I find the excuses,
[01:58.77]Overwhelmingly feeble.
[02:00.83]
[02:01.20]You go to the doctor,
[02:03.09]You need pills to sleep in.
[02:05.11]Well if you can convince him,
[02:06.96]Then I guess that's not cheating.
[02:08.93]
[02:09.30]So your daughter's depressed,
[02:11.08]We'll get her straight on the prozac.
[02:13.13]But little do you know,
[02:14.80]She already takes crack.
[02:17.81]
[02:18.15]Why can't we all,
[02:19.56]All just be honest,
[02:21.65]Admit to ourselves,
[02:23.60]That everyone's on it.
[02:25.39]
[02:25.75]From grown politicians,
[02:27.63]To young adolescents,
[02:29.70]Prescribing themselves,
[02:31.84]Anti-depressants.
[02:33.70]
[02:34.06]How can we start to tackle the problem,
[02:38.27]If you don't put your hands up,
[02:39.74]And admit that you're on them.
[02:41.88]
[02:42.22]The kids are in danger,
[02:44.04]They're all getting habits,
[02:46.10]Because from what I can see,
[02:48.45]Everyone's at it.
[02:52.70]Everyone's at it.
[02:56.58]Everyone's at it.
[03:00.52]Everyone's at it.
[03:02.30]
[03:23.42]Why can't we all,
[03:25.43]All just be honest,
[03:27.28]Admit to ourselves,
[03:29.24]That everyone's on it.
[03:31.07]
[03:31.49]From grown politicians,
[03:33.35]To young adolescents,
[03:35.30]Prescribing themselves,
[03:37.44]Anti-depressants.
[03:39.30]
[03:39.74]How can we start to tackle the problem,
[03:43.57]If you don't put your hands up,
[03:45.40]And admit that you're on them.
[03:47.38]
[03:47.76]The kids are in danger,
[03:49.66]They're all getting habits,
[03:51.73]Because from what I can see,
[03:53.97]Everyone's at it.
[03:58.34]Everyone's at it.
[04:02.42]Everyone's at it.
[04:06.31]Everyone's at it.
