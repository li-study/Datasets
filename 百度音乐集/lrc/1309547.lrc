[00:28.18]
[00:32.18]I had a friend named Victor
[00:33.54]The two of us used to hang every single day
[00:35.70]And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
[00:38.66]I know when his mom and dad broke up
[00:40.69]It didnt make sense but I know that his dad was a drunk
[00:43.16]And he gambled away the rent
[00:44.53]Pretty soon vic was seein red
[00:46.31]Pissed off but instead
[00:47.77]He drank every night til he passed out
[00:49.54]Then he’d do it all again
[00:50.77]The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
[00:53.35]But on the inside all he was tryin to do was get away
[00:56.29]
[00:56.77]Dying to get away
[00:59.97]Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
[01:08.23]
[01:08.80]Funny how things change color
[01:10.07]Then fade to another shade
[01:11.36]When you had it made it was all good
[01:12.83]But now look just another day
[01:14.38]It was so fresh it was so clean
[01:15.83]Now its all gone
[01:16.60]1, 2, 3, lights out
[01:17.82]Which way to turn
[01:18.61]Can't get a grip
[01:19.35]All alone in a big white house
[01:20.89]Everyday gets worse and you just curse
[01:22.60]'til your head bursts and it hurts so bad
[01:24.35]She left like yourself should have thought of that one first
[01:26.65]No family, no kids, can’t accept what you did
[01:29.40]Now you wanna runaway but you can't cuz the past comes back again
[01:32.30]
[01:32.74]Slippin through the cracks
[01:33.67]Sip a little jack
[01:34.41]Go to bed half dead
[01:35.33]What about rent
[01:36.08]Why does every cent gotta be a bet
[01:37.54]Whens it gonna end
[01:38.29]Oh my god, we dont got a penny left
[01:40.06]My mom’s gotta find a way to get a job
[01:41.86]Outta debt, outta dodge, outta breath, outta this big problem
[01:44.42]My pops wanna get away from the pain
[01:46.65]In a better place in his brain
[01:48.10]But the medication he takes makes him wasted
[01:50.55]So sick if hes gonna think the good lord would come take him
[01:53.55]Im shakin him wake up you son of a bitch
[01:56.37]
[01:56.74]He’s dying to get away
[01:59.76]Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
[02:08.74]Hiding himself away watching all the memories fade
[02:14.87]Away From red to black
[02:20.43]
[02:20.86]He’s dying to get away
[02:23.81]Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
[02:32.80]Hiding himself away watching all the memories fade
[02:38.88]Away From red to black
