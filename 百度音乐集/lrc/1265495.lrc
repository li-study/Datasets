[00:17.72]
[00:19.72]There you are
[00:21.71]In a darkened room
[00:24.10]And you're all alone
[00:26.53]Looking out the window
[00:29.60]Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
[00:36.12]Like a broken arrow
[00:38.82]
[00:39.47]Here I stand in the shadows
[00:43.91]Come to me, Come to me
[00:46.41]Can't you see that
[00:48.96]Nobody wants to be lonely
[00:53.68]Nobody wants to cry
[00:58.63]My body's longing to hold you
[01:03.29]so bad it hurts inside
[01:08.18]Time is precious and it's slipping away
[01:11.38]and I've been waiting for you all of my life
[01:17.68]Nobody wants to be lonely so why
[01:24.22]Why don't you let me love you
[01:28.87]
[01:36.10]Can you hear my voice
[01:38.43]Do you hear my song
[01:40.74]It's a serenade
[01:43.16]So your heart can find me
[01:46.20]And suddenly your flying down the stairs
[01:52.82]Into my arms, baby
[01:55.72]Before I start going crazy
[02:00.74]Run to me, Run to me
[02:03.11]Cause I'm dying
[02:05.69]Nobody wants to be lonely
[02:10.33]Nobody wants to cry
[02:15.37]My body's longing to hold you

[02:45.49]
[03:04.57]I want to feel you need me
[03:08.95]Just like the air you're breathing
[03:13.81]I need you here in my life
