[00:23.61]Maybe I'm starting to cry
[00:25.21]But I don't know
[00:26.27]Cause the feeling so strong
[00:27.78]And I just don't know what's wrong oh tell me
[00:29.67]Have you been willing to try to ease the load?
[00:32.96]It's getting heavy to hold
[00:34.42]Sometimes I'm wondering how far to go
[00:36.73]Who'll take the blame this time
[00:38.49]Who's gonna be wrong or right
[00:40.10]Who's gonna convict the time
[00:41.57]All tough with pride
[00:42.70]We said we're
[00:43.67]Never be the stereotype
[00:44.87]Never be stuck in life
[00:46.83]And never ever be so close to bye
[00:50.07]But When I see your face
[00:50.93]It could be love or hate
[00:53.79]I'm burning up with rage up with rage
[00:55.60]I'm gonna break
[00:56.98]I'm gonna break
[00:58.23]Oh baby, I'm Breaking Down
[01:03.03]I'm living misery
[01:04.75]But I don't wanna be

[01:07.71]But this ain't me
[01:08.76]I'm gonna break
[01:09.67]I'm gonna break
[01:12.15]Oh baby, I'm Breaking Down
[01:16.23]Will I just be wondering why
[01:17.81]This didn't work
[01:18.92]With my face in the dirt
[01:20.36]Seems I've been loving to hurt
[01:21.76]Oh tell me
[01:22.89]Was it worth the lost time?
[01:24.32]Good or bad?
[01:25.66]Am I happy or sad?
[01:27.43]Feel like I lost what I never had
[01:29.43]Should we just say goodbye?
[01:30.83]Is it even worth the try?
[01:32.46]I stay awake at night
[01:34.10]turning words in my head
[01:36.12]Caught up in reverie
[01:37.42]Of what we'll never be
[01:39.19]Or maybe baby what we never were
[01:42.66]Cause when I see your face
[01:43.99]It could be love or hate
[01:45.72]I'm burning up with rage up with rage
[01:48.52]I'm gonna break
[01:50.07]I'm gonna break
[01:51.62]Oh baby, I'm Breaking Down

[01:57.96]But I don't wanna be
[01:59.67]Caught up in jealousy
[02:00.69]But this ain't me
[02:01.98]I'm gonna break
[02:03.10]I'm gonna break
[02:04.38]Oh baby, I'm Breaking Down
