[00:13.96]I close my eyes,
[00:18.36]And even when I'm sleeping
[00:21.22]I'm alright,
[00:25.70]'Cause You are in my life.
[00:28.36]Once upon a time,
[00:32.13]I only imagined this
[00:35.34]And now You're mine.
[00:39.54]Oh, I tried so hard...
[00:42.57]Prayed that You'd find me;
[00:46.14]Maybe You're here today,
[00:50.01]Here to remind me:
[00:53.10]If you believe that dreams come true,
[00:57.15]There's One that's waiting there for you.
[01:00.66]'Cause I believed when I saw You
[01:04.02]That when you want something enough,
[01:08.57]That it can't escape Your love.
[01:13.94]There is nothing in the world that cannot be...
[01:19.58]If you believe, oh oh...
[01:27.43]Everybody said
[01:31.05]That I was a fool to think
[01:34.73]That we could bear; (Everybody said that...)
[01:39.05]But I couldn't get my heart out of my head,
[01:45.52]And they just didn't see;
[01:49.26]No, they just could not.
[01:52.49]Feeling that You care,
[01:56.30]The places that You can...
[01:59.91]If you believe that dreams come true,
[02:03.44]There's One that's waiting there for you.
[02:07.13]'Cause I believed when I saw You
[02:10.03]That when you want something enough,
[02:14.90]That it can't escape Your love.
[02:18.25]There is nothing in the world that cannot be...
[02:23.89]If you believe.
[02:29.61]Never wished for material things;
[02:33.20]Never needed wind in my wings.
[02:37.23]I never wished for anything but You...oh!
[02:43.94]I can't explain it,
[02:46.51]Someone just told me,
[02:49.98]“Go where your heart is,
[02:53.65]You'll never be lonely.”
[02:56.94]If you believe that dreams come true,
[03:02.45]There's One that's waiting there for you.
[03:05.76]'Cause I believed when I saw You
[03:09.58]That (when you believe) when You want Someone enough,
[03:13.71]Then they can't escape Your love.
[03:17.01]There is nothing in the world that cannot be,
[03:23.02]If you believe.
[03:30.40]Believe, believe, believe, ooh....
