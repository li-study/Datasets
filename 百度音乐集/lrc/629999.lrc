[00:00.08]The Reflex
[00:06.28]Duran Duran
[00:16.41]You've gone too far this time
[00:19.05]But I'm dancing on the valentine
[00:23.86]I tell you somebody's fooling around
[00:26.76]With my chances on the dangerline
[00:31.23]I'll cross that bridge when I find it
[00:33.57]Another day to make my stand ooh
[00:38.94]High time is no time for deciding
[00:41.83]If I should find a helping hand ooh
[00:46.32]So why... don't you use it?
[00:50.22]Try... not to bruise it
[00:54.21]Buy... time don't lose it
[01:01.54]So why... don't you use it?
[01:05.54]Try... not to bruise it
[01:09.39]Buy... time don't lose it
[01:16.91]The reflex is an only child he's waiting by the park
[01:24.40]The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
[01:32.14]And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
[01:39.79]Every little thing the reflex does
[01:43.19]Leaves you answered with a question mark
[01:48.02]~~~~~~
[01:55.71]I'm on a ride and I want to get off
[01:58.23]But they won't slow down the roundabout
[02:02.91]I sold the Renoir and the TV set
[02:05.75]Don't want to be around when this gets out
[02:10.29]So why... don't you use it?
[02:14.01]Try... not to bruise it
[02:17.76]Buy... time don't lose it
[02:25.61]~~~~~~
[02:40.84]The reflex is an only child he's waiting by the park
[02:47.88]The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
[02:55.43]And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
[03:03.12]Every little thing the reflex does
[03:06.62]Leaves you answered with a question mark
[03:10.85]~~~~~~
[03:25.48]So why... don't you use it?
[03:29.32]Try... not to bruise it
[03:32.95]Buy... time don't lose it
[03:40.59]The reflex is an only child he's waiting by the park
[03:47.84]The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
[03:55.17]And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
[04:02.61]Every little thing the reflex does
[04:06.39]Leaves you answered with a question mark
[04:11.09]Oh the reflex what a game he's hiding all the cards ...
