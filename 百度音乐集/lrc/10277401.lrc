[00:26.42]Am I more than you bargained for yet
[00:30.16]I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
[00:35.74]Cause that's just who I am this week
[00:38.70]Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
[00:43.03]I'm just a notch in your bedpost
[00:46.38]But you're just a line in a song
[00:47.45](A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
[00:50.65]Drop a heart, break a name
[00:56.54]We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
[01:02.40]We're going down, down in an earlier round
[01:05.80]And Sugar, we're going down swinging
[01:08.55]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[01:11.75]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[01:14.70]We're going down, down in an earlier round
[01:17.43]And Sugar, we're going down swinging
[01:20.52]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[01:23.35]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[01:37.80]Is this more than you bargained for yet
[01:41.08]Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
[01:45.84]Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
[01:49.58]Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
[01:54.98]I'm just a notch in your bedpost
[01:56.87]But you're just a line in a song
[01:58.59](Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
[02:01.45]Drop a heart, break a name
[02:07.30]We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
[02:13.05]We're going down, down in an earlier round
[02:16.00]And Sugar, we're going down swinging
[02:18.71]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[02:22.05]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[02:24.73]We're going down, down in an earlier round
[02:27.78]And Sugar, we're going down swinging
[02:30.49]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[02:33.49]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[02:38.59]Down, down in an earlier round
[02:41.13]And Sugar, we're going down swinging
[02:43.75]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[02:47.14]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[02:50.13]We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
[02:53.12]And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
[02:55.91]I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
[02:58.87]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[03:01.73]We're going down, down (down, down)
[03:04.98]Down, down (down, down)
[03:07.73]We're going down, down (down, down)
[03:10.96]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[03:13.52]We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
[03:16.87]And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
[03:19.41]I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
[03:22.74]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
