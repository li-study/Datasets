[00:20.04]The Night I Fell in Love
[00:31.26]2003 - Release - Pet Shop Boy
[00:34.96]
[00:41.24]I was backstage
[00:46.25]couldn't believe my luck was in
[00:51.09]I saw him approach
[00:56.14]wearing a most approachable grin
[01:00.73]When he said hello
[01:03.75]I was surprised he spoke so politely
[01:10.76]I said I'd liked his show
[01:13.70]Well he just smiled
[01:16.75]I guess it happens nightly
[01:19.66]and so
[01:21.13]I fell in love
[01:24.96]
[01:26.07]We went to his room
[01:30.63]he had a video camera
[01:36.06]I was so nervous
[01:41.03]I had to try hard not to stammer
[01:45.11]He said
[01:45.86]"I'm glad you liked the show
[01:48.43]that crowd was dope out there tonight, alright
[01:55.84]You wanna see some more?
[01:58.57]Well be my guest
[02:01.12]You can have a private performance"
[02:06.04]I'd fallen in love
[02:09.85]
[02:10.96]I didn't ask why
[02:15.40]though he seemed like such a regular guy
[02:20.47]he said we could be
[02:23.68]secret lovers
[02:26.42]just him and me
[02:30.79]Then he joked
[02:31.79]"Hey, man!
[02:33.40]Your name isn't Stan, is it?
[02:36.21]We should be together!"
[02:40.83]And he was passionate
[02:43.42]I guess I would rate
[02:46.27]him a nine out of ten
[02:48.86]by then
[02:50.94]I'd fallen in love
[02:54.74]
[02:57.25]When I asked
[03:01.37]why have I heard so much
[03:06.41]about him being charged
[03:11.19]with homophobia and stuff
[03:16.39]he just shrugged
[03:22.15]
[03:43.26]Next morning we woke
[03:48.35]he couldn't have been a nicer bloke
[03:52.77]Over breakfast made jokes
[03:58.24]about Dre and his homies and folks
[04:03.24]Neither of us asked if or when
[04:08.64]we would see each other again
[04:12.85]but I thought that was cool
[04:15.76]'cause I was already late for school
[04:21.07]by then
[04:23.26]I'd fallen in love
[04:28.22]
