[00:06.70]Why dont you fool me, feed me, say you need me,
[00:10.16]without wicked games
[00:13.44]Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me,
[00:16.99]and not my dirty brain

[00:33.80]I got one Alabama return,
[00:37.35]that'll take me far away from you
[00:41.13]Cause when you take me in your arms,
[00:43.21]I turn to slave but I can't be saved
[00:46.37]So I got my cappuccino to go,
[00:51.10]and I’m heading for the hills again
[00:54.64]Cause if we party any more, we'll start a fire of pure desire
[00:59.82]Closer, your minds firing blind with your head
[01:03.78]in your face getting red in your heart beats closer
[01:07.19]You fall on your knees and the geek at your feet
[01:10.47]says you're neat and the beat gets closer
[01:14.18]You dive for the thrill at the kill
[01:16.87]but your heart’s at its fill but it still creeps closer
[01:20.65]You wanted to freeze but you're weak in too deep
[01:24.09]and the beat and the beat gets closer
[01:27.09]Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer
[01:33.23]We give it up
[01:34.03]And then they take it away
[01:37.96]A girl’s got to zip it up
[01:40.98]And get her head in the shade
[01:45.38]Baby if we give it up
[01:47.36]Its just a matter of time
[01:51.19]Before all the heavy stuff
[01:54.29]Comes back to bite your behind
[01:56.95]
