[00:00.00]I dreamed a dream

[00:13.87]I dreamed a dream in days gone by
[00:21.64]When hope was high and life worth living
[00:29.52]I dreamed that love would never die
[00:37.47]I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
[00:45.85]Then I was young and unafraid
[00:53.76]And dreams were made and used and wasted.
[01:01.84]There was no ransom to be paid,
[01:10.55]No song unsung, no wine untasted.
[01:18.26]But the tigers come at night
[01:25.37]With their voices soft as thunder
[01:33.25]As they tear your hope apart
[01:40.52]As they turn your dream to shame.
[01:55.12]He slept a summer by my side,
[02:02.45]He filled my days with endless wonder.
[02:09.70]He took my childhood in his stride
[02:18.10]But he was gone when autumn came.
[02:31.29]And still I dreamed he'd come to me,
[02:37.84]That we would live the years together
[02:45.51]But there are dreams that can not be
[02:53.57]And there are storms we can not weather.
[03:03.32]I had a dream my life would be
[03:10.77]So different from this hell I'm living,
[03:15.92]So different now from what it seemed
[03:25.18]Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.
