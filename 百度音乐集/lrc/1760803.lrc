[00:00.69]You look into my eyes
[00:02.76]I go out of my mind
[00:05.31]I can't see anything
[00:07.63]Cos this love's got me blind
[00:09.89]I can't help myself
[00:12.34]I can't break the spell
[00:14.90]I can't even try
[00:17.78]
[00:19.59]I'm in over my head
[00:22.11]You got under my skin
[00:24.75]I got no strength at all
[00:27.22]In the state that I'm in
[00:29.84]And my knees are weak
[00:32.24]And my mouth can't speak
[00:34.60]Fell too far this time
[00:37.24]
[00:38.38]Chorus:
[00:39.35]Baby, I'm too lost in you
[00:43.22]Caught in you
[00:46.14]Lost in everything about you
[00:49.63]So deep, I can't sleep
[00:53.78]I can't think
[00:56.04]I just think about the things that you do (you do)
[01:03.37]I'm too lost in you
[01:05.85](Too lost in you)
[01:08.08]
[01:08.54]ooh
[01:09.50]Well you whispered to me
[01:11.33]And I shiver inside
[01:14.01]You undo me and move me
[01:16.63]In ways undefined
[01:18.57]And you're all I see
[01:20.97]And you're all I need
[01:23.35]Help me baby (help me baby)
[01:26.06]Help me baby (help me now)
[01:28.28]
[01:28.86]Cos I'm slipping away
[01:30.86]Like the sand to the tide
[01:33.36]Falling into your arms
[01:35.89]Falling into your eyes
[01:38.19]If you get too near
[01:40.59]I might disappear
[01:43.01]I might lose my mind
[01:45.80]
[01:46.54]Chorus:
[01:48.04]Baby, I'm too lost in you
[01:52.33]Caught in you
[01:54.77]Lost in everything about you
[01:57.94]So deep, I can't sleep
[02:01.96]I can't think
[02:04.53]I just think about the things that you do (you do)
[02:11.81]I'm too lost in you
[02:14.47](Too lost in you)
[02:16.71]I'm going in crazy in love for you baby
[02:27.17]I'm going down like a stone in the sea
[02:33.20]Yeah, no one can mess with me
[02:36.09](No one can mess with me)
[02:38.03]
[02:38.56]Oooh, my baby
[02:54.10]Oooh, baby, baby
[02:58.90]
[02:58.73]Baby, I'm too lost in you
[03:03.48]Caught in you
[03:06.00]Lost in everything about you
[03:09.21]So deep, I can't sleep
[03:13.06]I can't think
[03:15.45]I just think about the things that you do (you do)
[03:22.90]I'm too lost in you
[03:24.70]
[03:25.32]I'm lost in you
[03:27.98]I'm lost in you
[03:30.15]I'm lost in everything about you
[03:33.40]So deep (so deep), I can't sleep
[03:37.29]I can't think
[03:39.95]I just think about the things that you do (you do)
[03:47.38]I'm too lost in you
[03:50.33](Too lost in you)
