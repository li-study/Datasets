[00:33.66]Well, I know that it's early and it's too hard to think
[00:39.02]and the broken empty bottles are reminder in the sink
[00:45.22]But I thought that I should tell you, if it's not to late to say
[00:51.24]I could put back all the pieces, they just might not fit the same
[00:56.85]
[00:57.21]Cuz nothing's worth losing especially the chance to make it right
[01:08.52]
[01:09.07]And I know that we're gonna be fine
[01:14.54]And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
[01:20.47]As long as we live, time passes by
[01:26.47]And we won't get it back when we die
[01:33.29]
[01:40.96]Well, I know it's been years now, and I don't look the same
[01:46.78]And the hopes and dreams you had for me you thought went down the drain.
[01:52.66]And the room feels so empty where my pictures used to be
[01:58.47]And I can't say that I blame you, but you can't blame me
[02:04.07]
[02:04.69]Cuz nothing's worth losing especially the chance to make it right
[02:15.87]
[02:16.29]And I know that we're gonna be fine
