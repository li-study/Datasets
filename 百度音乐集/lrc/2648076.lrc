[00:18.88]Who am I to need you when I'm down?
[00:27.51]Where are you when I need you around?
[00:39.54]Your life is not your own
[00:45.21]And all I ask you
[00:48.95]Is for another chance
[00:53.69]Another way around you
[01:00.52]To live by circumstance, once again
[01:08.30]Who am I to need you now?
[01:15.01]To ask you why, to tell you no
[01:20.43]To deserve your love and sympathy
[01:26.46]You were never meant to belong to me
[01:34.27]And you may go, but I know you won't leave
[01:45.68]Too many years built into memories
[01:55.72]Your life is not your own
[02:04.02]Who am I to need you now?
[02:09.12]To ask you why, to tell you no
[02:14.91]To deserve your love and sympathy
[02:20.83]You were never meant to belong to me
[02:37.00]Who am I to you?
[02:39.66]Along the way
[02:44.55]I lost my faith
[02:49.78]And as you were, you'll be again
[02:52.60]To mold like clay, to break like dirt
[02:57.75]To tear me up in your sympathy
[03:03.20]You were never meant to belong to me
[03:09.40]You were never meant to belong to me
[03:15.37]You were never meant to belong to me
[03:21.57]Who am I?
