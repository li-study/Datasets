[00:03.85]
[00:11.51]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
[00:16.90]I'll tell you that
[00:22.12]But if I didn't say it
[00:25.32]Well, I'd still have felt it
[00:28.21]Where's the sense in that?
[00:33.13]I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
[00:39.45]Or return to where we were
[00:41.60]
[00:45.75]Well I will go down with this ship
[00:50.29]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[00:55.73]There will be no white flag above my door
[01:01.86]I'm in love and always will be
[01:08.07]I know I left too much mess
[01:12.05]And destruction to come back again
[01:18.50]And I caused but nothing but trouble
[01:21.89]I understand if you can't talk to me again
[01:26.86]
[01:31.05]And if you live by the rules of It's over
[01:35.80]Then I'm sure that that makes sense
[01:42.04]Well I will go down with this ship
[01:46.80]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[01:52.24]There will be no white flag above my door
[01:58.07]I'm in love and always will be
[02:03.55]And when we meet
[02:06.28]As I'm sure we will
[02:09.15]All that was then
[02:12.09]Will be there still
[02:14.80]I'll let it pass
[02:17.62]And hold my tongue
[02:20.47]And you will think
[02:23.20]That I've moved on
[02:27.59]Well I will go down with this ship
[02:31.90]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[02:37.44]There will be no white flag above my door
[02:43.45]I'm in love and always will be
[02:48.93]
[02:50.19]I will go down with this ship
[02:54.57]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[03:00.01]There will be no white flag above my door
[03:05.91]I'm in love and always will be
[03:12.69]I will go down with this ship
[03:17.13]And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[03:22.50]There will be no white flag above my door
[03:28.58]I'm in love and always will be
