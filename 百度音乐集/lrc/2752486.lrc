[00:17.52]I don't know how to begin
[00:24.51]'Cause the story has been told before
[00:31.73]I will sing along I suppose
[00:37.08]I guess it's just how it goes
[00:47.10]And now those spring in the air
[00:52.80]I don't go down anyway
[01:01.56]I guess it's just how it goes
[01:05.25]The story have all been told before
[01:15.59]If you don't try
[01:21.87]The light won't hit your eyes
[01:30.29]And the moon won't rise and fall in sight
[01:42.96]
[02:10.31]If you don't try
[02:16.07]The light won't hit your eyes
[02:24.30]And the moon won't rise and fall in sight
[02:37.56]I don't know how it'll end
[02:43.19]Though the records play
[02:50.81]I guess it's just how it goes
[02:56.10]The story have all been told before
[03:01.69]I guess it's just how it goes
[03:08.76]The story have all been told before
[03:16.00]I guess it's just how it goes
