[00:05.50]
[00:13.12]|Toni Braxton|
[00:13.31]Gave you the benefit of the doubt
[00:16.21]'Till you showed me what you were about
[00:19.20]Your true colours came out
[00:22.63]And your words couldn't hide the sin
[00:28.15]'Cause the truth about where you've been
[00:31.18]Is in a fragrance I can't recognize
[00:35.75]Just standing there, scratching your head
[00:39.09]Blood shot eyes, drunk with regret
[00:42.05]Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
[00:47.86]
[00:48.07]I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
[00:52.60]Loving you, I'm over it
[00:55.68]I just don't love you, don't love you no more
[01:00.02]
[01:00.21]|Chorus|
[01:00.37]You, you are so yesterday
[01:04.57]Never thought you'd lose my love this way
[01:07.61]Now you come begging me to stay
[01:11.88]See you, you are so yesterday
[01:16.57]I won't let you rain on my parade
[01:19.51]I don't wanna hear a thing you say
[01:23.14]You're so yesterday
[01:24.91]
[01:25.09]|Trey Songz|
[01:25.41]Baby what you're saying to me is
[01:28.52]There's no more you and I
[01:31.23]I couldn't get it right on yesterday
[01:34.55]So kiss our tomorrows goodbye
[01:37.45]Baby love should ride me home
[01:40.26]Should've just been a man about it
[01:43.24]But now I'm crying like a baby
[01:44.66]Girl your love was like my blanket
[01:46.31]Don't know what to do without it
[01:47.82]
[01:48.00]I'm standing here, pleading my case
[01:51.00]You don't care, to hear what I say
[01:54.00]
[01:54.21]|Toni Braxton|
[01:54.37]Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
[01:59.69]|Trey Songz|
[01:59.89]My promises don't mean nothing
[02:03.18]The end is so disgusting
[02:07.34]|Toni Braxton|

[02:31.50]I don't wanna hear a thing you say
[02:35.23]You're so yesterday
[02:37.00]
[02:37.21]|Bridge|
[02:37.43]And now you wanna reminisce
[02:39.67](Now I wanna reminisce)
[02:40.63]Say you wanna try again
[02:42.20](Said I wanna try again)
[02:43.54]It start out with a little kiss
[02:45.35](A kiss)
[02:46.33]But we can't even be friends (oh no)
[02:48.03]No no now i never wanna see you,
[02:51.07]Never wanna feel you,
[02:52.53]Never wanna hear you
[02:54.22]I don't love you,
