[00:00.00]Travis - Writing to Reach You
[00:22.87]
[00:26.87]Every day I wake up and it's Sunday
[00:32.45]Whatever's in my eye won't go away
[00:38.26]The radio is playing all the usual
[00:44.14]What's a Wonderwall anyway
[00:48.88]
[00:49.26]Because my inside is outside
[00:52.41]My right side's on the left side
[00:55.57]Cause I'm writing to reach you now but
[00:59.48]I might never reach you
[01:01.73]Only want to teach you
[01:05.98]About you
[01:09.71]But that's not you
[01:11.77]
[01:12.14]It's good to know that you are home for Christmas
[01:17.90]It's good to know that you are doing well
[01:23.71]It's good to know that you all know I'm hurting
[01:29.58]It's good to know I'm feeling not so well
[01:34.42]
[01:34.79]Because my inside is outside
[01:37.97]My right side's on the left side
[01:40.96]Cause I'm writing to reach you now but
[01:44.79]I might never reach you
[01:47.21]Only want to teach you
[01:51.31]About you
[01:54.56]But that's not you
[01:57.10]Do you know it's true
[02:00.93]But that won't do
[02:03.42]
[02:26.77]Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday
[02:32.39]And whatever's in my eye should go away
[02:38.10]But the radio keeps playing all the usual
[02:44.23]And what's a Wonderwall anyway
[02:48.90]
[02:49.43]Because my inside is outside
[02:52.86]My right side's on the left side
[02:55.64]Cause I'm writing to reach you now but
[02:59.11]I might never reach you
[03:02.08]Only want to teach you
[03:06.12]About you
[03:09.71]But that's not you
[03:11.84]Do you know it's true
[03:15.60]But that won't do
[03:18.00]And you know it's you
[03:21.47]I'm talking to
[03:26.53]
