[00:38.02]Oh, you know I have seen
[00:40.52]A sky without sun
[00:42.42]A man with no nation
[00:45.44]Saints, captive in chains
[00:48.21]A song with no name
[00:49.80]For lack of imagination
[00:53.04]Ya he...
[00:56.67]And I have seen
[00:58.81]Darker than ebony
[01:00.63]Ya he Ya he Ya la he
[01:03.69]And now it seems, that I
[01:05.98]Without your eyes could never be
[01:08.36]My one desire, all I aspire
[01:09.30]Is in your eyes forever to live
[01:11.92]Traveled all over the seven oceans
[01:14.28]There is nothing that I wouldn't give
[01:15.83]Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
[01:17.59]Looking for someone comparing to you
[01:19.73]Tearing down windows and doors
[01:21.68]And I could not find eyes like yours
[01:30.80]Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
[01:33.00]Looking for someone comparing to you
[01:34.57]Tearing down windows and doors
[01:35.52]And I could not find eyes like yours
[01:46.36]Oh, You know I seen
[01:48.39]A woman of means
[01:50.31]In rags and begging for pleasure
[01:53.48]Crossed a river of salt
[01:56.18]Just after I rode
[01:57.75]A ship that's sunk in the desert
[02:01.03]Ya he Ya he Ya la he
[02:04.16]And I have seen
[02:06.99]Darker than ebony
[02:08.88]Ya he Ya he Ya la he
[02:12.12]And now it seems, that I
[02:14.08]Without your eyes could never be
[02:16.15]My one desire, all I aspire
