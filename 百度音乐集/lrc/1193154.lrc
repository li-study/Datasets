[00:07.73]Turn around
[00:09.86]Every now and then I get a little bit
[00:12.13]lonely and you're never coming round.
[00:15.24]Turn around
[00:17.41]Every now and then I get a little bit
[00:19.56]tired of listening to the sound of my tears.
[00:22.77]Turn around
[00:24.58]Every now and then I get a little bit
[00:26.94]nervous that the best of all the years have gone by.
[00:30.26]Turn around
[00:32.27]Every now and then I get a little bit
[00:34.71]terrified and then I see the look in your eyes.
[00:37.82]Turn around, bright eyes
[00:41.56]Every now and the I fall apart.
[00:43.41]Turn around, bright eyes
[00:46.93]Every now and the I fall apart.
[00:50.32]And I need you now tonight
[00:53.77]and I need you more than ever
[00:57.31]and if you only hold me tight
[01:00.74]we'll be holding on forever.
[01:04.57]And we'll only be making it right
[01:08.10]'cause we'll never be wrong.
[01:10.30]Together we can take it to the end of the line.
[01:14.03]Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.
[01:17.51](All of the time)
[01:19.46]I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark.
[01:23.00]We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.
[01:27.31]I really need you tonight,
[01:30.32]forever's gonna start tonight,
[01:33.67]forever's gonna start tonight.

[01:47.20]a total eclipse of the heart.

[01:56.38]Once upon a time there was light in my life
[01:59.80]but now there's only love in the dark.

[02:18.58]Turn around
[02:20.63]Every now and then I get a little bit
[02:23.10]restless and I dream of something wild.
[02:26.12]Turn around
[02:27.98]Every now and then I get a little bit
[02:30.46]helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms.
[02:33.60]Turn around
[02:35.40]Every now and then I get a little bit
[02:37.83]angry and I know I've got to get out and cry.
