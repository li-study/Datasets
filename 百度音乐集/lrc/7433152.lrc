[00:06.50]A
[00:13.74]Friday night I crashed your party
[00:16.00]
[00:16.97]Saturday I said I'm sorry
[00:19.50]E
[00:20.21]Sunday came and trashed me out again
[00:24.35]Bm
[00:26.23]I was only having fun
[00:28.36]G
[00:29.48]Wasn't hurting anyone
[00:32.53]E                               A
[00:32.84]And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
[00:35.40]
[00:36.54]A
[00:39.32]I've been stranded in the combat zone
[00:41.16]
[00:42.65]I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
[00:45.48]E
[00:45.94]Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
[00:48.93]Bm
[00:52.02]And you told me not to drive
[00:54.91]G
[00:55.26]But I made it home alive
[00:58.08]E                                A
[00:58.28]So you said that only proves that I'm insane
[01:02.96]Chorus:
[01:04.55]You may be right
[01:07.58]I may be crazy
[01:09.05]E             D              F
[01:10.47]But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
[01:16.86]Turn out the lights
[01:20.06]Don't try to save me
[01:22.79]D               E                   A
[01:23.40]You may be wrong for all I know but you may be right
[01:27.43]A
[01:33.60]Remember how I found you there
[01:36.34]
[01:36.74]Alone in your electric chair
[01:39.77]E
[01:40.03]I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
[01:45.65]Bm
[01:46.29]You were lonely for a man
[01:49.04]G
[01:49.47]I said take me as I am
[01:50.90]E                             A
[01:52.63]Cause you might enjoy some madness for awhile
[01:56.41]
[01:56.83]A
[01:59.01]Now think of all the years you've tried to
[02:01.95]
[02:02.54]Find someone to satisfy you
[02:05.12]E
[02:05.56]I might be as crazy as they say
[02:08.79]Bm
[02:11.22]If I'm crazy then it's true
[02:13.82]G
[02:14.72]That it's all because of you
[02:16.68]E                          A
[02:17.94]And you wouldn't want me any other way
[02:23.71]You may be right
[02:26.43]I may be crazy
[02:27.73]E             D              F          A
[02:29.83]But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
[02:36.18]It's too late to fight
[02:39.34]It's too late to change me
[02:41.83]D               E                   A
[02:42.82]You may be wrong for all I know but you may be right
