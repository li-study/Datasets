[00:00.00]What You Want
[00:01.00]Evanescence
[00:01.57]
[00:04.15]Do what you what you want,
[00:06.19]if you have a dream for better
[00:12.02]Do what you what you want
[00:13.81]till you don't want it anymore
[00:17.57](remember who you really are)
[00:20.15]
[00:27.68]Do what you what you want,
[00:29.78]your world's closing in on you now
[00:33.52](it isn't over)
[00:36.02]Stand and face the unknown
[00:40.51](got to remember who you really are)
[00:45.12]Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection
[00:52.20]Hello, hello remember me?
[00:55.97]I'm everything you can't control
[00:59.72]Somewhere beyond the pain
[01:03.19]There must be a way 
[01:05.00]To believe we can break through
[01:08.61]
[01:11.11]Do what you what you want, 
[01:12.80]you don't have to lay your life down
[01:16.66](it isn't over)
[01:18.97]Do what you what you want 
[01:20.79]Till you find what you're looking for
[01:23.77](got to remember who you really are)
[01:28.19]But every hour slipping 
[01:31.09]By screams that I have failed you
[01:35.49]Hello, hello remember me?
[01:39.21]I'm everything you can't control
[01:43.09]Somewhere beyond the pain there must 
[01:47.14]Be a way to believe
[01:51.41]Hello, hello remember me?
[01:55.49]I'm everything you can't control
[01:59.29]Somewhere beyond the pain there must 
[02:03.16]Be a way to believe
[02:06.72]
[02:07.87]There's still time
[02:09.61]Close your eyes
[02:11.48]Only love will guide you home
[02:16.46]Tear down the walls and free your soul
[02:25.46]Till we crash we're forever 
[02:28.90]Spiraling down, down, down, down
[02:38.44]Hello, hello, it's only me
[02:42.18]Infecting everything you love
[02:46.11]Somewhere beyond the pain there must 
[02:50.02]Be a way to believe
[02:54.36]Hello, hello remember me?
[02:58.45]I'm everything you can't control
[03:01.65]Somewhere beyond the pain there must 
[03:06.00]Be a way to learn forgiveness
[03:10.16]Hello, hello remember me?
[03:14.13]I'm everything you can't control
[03:17.86]Somewhere beyond the pain there must 
[03:21.73]Be a way to believe we can break through
[03:26.32]
[03:30.22](remember who you really are)
[03:32.80]Do what you what you want
[03:34.77]
