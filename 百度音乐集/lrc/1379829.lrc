[00:25.40]It's amazing how you
[00:29.17]can speak right to my heart
[00:32.57]
[00:36.99]Without saying a word
[00:40.66]you could light up the dark
[00:44.03]
[00:47.23]Try is a may I could never explain
[00:53.69]What I hear when you don't say a thing
[00:59.61]
[01:02.53]The smile on your face
[01:04.97]let's me no that you need me
[01:08.41]There's a truth in your eyes
[01:10.45]saying you'll never leave me
[01:14.10]The touch of your hand
[01:15.96]says you'll catch me if ever I fall
[01:24.28]You say it best
[01:27.92]when you say nothing at all
[01:33.23]
[01:41.52]All day long I could hear
[01:44.92]people talking about
[01:49.12]
[01:52.71]But when you hold me near
[01:56.81]you drown out the crowd
[02:00.15]
[02:03.82]Try as they may they can never define
[02:09.44]What's being said between your heart and mine
[02:16.29]The smile on your face
[02:18.00]let's me no that you need me
[02:21.55]There's a truth in your eyes
[02:23.49]saying you'll never leave me
[02:27.18]The touch of your hand
[02:29.03]says you'll catch me if ever I fall
[02:36.84]
[02:38.39]You say it best
[02:41.42]when you say nothing at all
[02:49.23]
[02:53.75]when you say nothing at all
[03:01.56]

[03:07.68]let's me know when you need me
[03:11.12]There's a truth in your eyes
[03:13.17]saying you'll never leave me
