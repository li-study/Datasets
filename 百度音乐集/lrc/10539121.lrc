[00:04.87]Title : Seasons Of The Heart
[00:13.66]Of course we have our differences
[00:17.22]You shouldn’t be surprised
[00:21.49]It’s as natural as changes in the seasons and the skies
[00:27.45]Sometimes we grow together
[00:31.67]Sometimes we drift apart
[00:33.67]A wiser man than I might know
[00:42.58]The seasons of the heart
[00:44.45]And I’m walking here beside you
[00:46.45]In the early evening chill
[00:50.28]A thing we’ve always loved to do
[00:54.24]I know we always will
[00:56.85]We have so much in common
[00:59.85]So many things we share
[01:04.47]That I can’t believe my heart
[01:07.91]When it implies that you’re not there
[01:13.21]Love is why I came here in the first place
[01:20.69]Love is now the reason I must go
[01:27.61]Love is all I ever hoped to find here
[01:33.33]Love is still the only dream I know
[01:52.23]So I don’t know how to tell you
[01:55.23]It’s difficult to say
[02:00.53]I never in my wildest dreams
[02:03.19]Imagined it this way
[02:05.19]But sometimes I just don’t know you
[02:11.04]There’s a stranger in our home
[02:14.03]When I’m lying right beside you
[02:17.44]Is when I’m most alone
[02:21.37]And I think my heart is broken
[02:24.37]There’s an emptiness inside
[02:26.37]So many things I’ve longed for
[02:30.17]Have so often been denied
[02:35.02]But still I wouldn’t try to change you
[02:38.02]There’s no one that’s to blame
[02:41.75]It’s just some things that mean so much
[02:45.35]And we just don’t feel the same
[02:49.75]Love is why I came here in the first place
[02:59.17]Love is now the reason I must go
[03:03.25]Love is all I ever hoped to find here
[03:11.81]Love is still the only dream I know
[03:16.06]True love is still the only dream I know
