[00:09.96]I saw you and fell in love
[00:15.47]You saw me and fell in love, too
[00:21.49]You and me
[00:23.31]we fell in love with each other last night
[00:33.14]I told you that I was concerned
[00:39.29]You told me of your concerns, too
[00:45.30]Yet and still we both decided
[00:50.32]To make love last night
[00:54.79]Baby, please tell me
[00:58.01]
[03:33.81][02:40.56][01:00.18]Where do we go from here my love
[03:38.96][02:45.38][01:04.95]What are we doing baby
[02:47.87][01:07.41]Boy you gotta let me know
[03:45.58][02:52.18][01:11.48]Why can’t we live the way we want
[03:50.70][02:57.35][01:16.51]I want the world to know
[03:53.06][02:59.68][01:18.92]I just gotta let it show
[03:57.78][03:04.16][01:23.39]What do we stand to lose
[04:01.97][03:08.58][01:27.78]If being together
[04:04.30][03:11.06][01:30.26]Is what we choose
[04:07.86][03:15.20][01:33.91]Oh my love
[04:10.84][03:17.18][01:36.33]I think that we should talk About us
[01:40.86]
[01:50.35]Could this be a crazy dream
[01:56.21]And if so then you’re dreaming too
[02:02.26]’Cause I know for sure that
[02:05.36]You feel the same as I do
[02:13.43]Could it be that we could be wrong
[02:20.07]Even though we’re feeling so right
[02:26.11]I don’t care because I know
[02:30.62]That I want you tonight
[02:35.75]And I know you want me too
[02:39.08]
[03:19.81]You see all my live I’ve waited
[03:23.29]Waited all my life
[03:25.82]Just to be with someone like you
[03:32.53]
[03:41.40]I want to know
[04:00,00]
