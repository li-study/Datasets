[00:26.45]Moby - Extreme ways
[00:29.19]
[00:53.78]Extreme ways are back again
[00:55.49]Extreme places I didn‘t know
[00:57.98]I broke everything new again
[01:00.22]Everything that I‘d owned
[01:02.52]I threw it out the windows, came along
[01:05.36]Extreme ways I know, will part
[01:07.36]The colors of my sea
[01:09.75]Perfect color me
[01:11.50]
[01:12.38]Extreme ways that help me
[01:14.45]They help me out late at night
[01:16.81]Extreme places I had gone
[01:19.30]But never seen any light
[01:21.63]Dirty basements, dirty noise
[01:24.20]Dirty places coming through
[01:26.64]Extreme worlds alone
[01:28.77]Did you ever like it planned
[01:30.92]
[01:32.20]I would stand in line for this
[01:36.38]There‘s always room in life for this
[01:39.83]
[01:41.39]Oh baby, oh baby
[01:45.52]Then it fell apart, fell apart
[01:50.80]Oh baby, oh baby
[01:55.04]Then it fell apart, it fell apart
[02:00.22]Oh baby, oh baby
[02:04.59]Then it fell apart, it fell apart
[02:09.85]Oh baby, oh baby
[02:14.14]Like it always does, always does
[02:19.26]
[02:20.14]Extreme songs that told me
[02:21.76]They helped me down every night
[02:24.09]I didn‘t have much to say
[02:26.46]I didn‘t get above the light
[02:28.93]I closed my eyes and closed myself
[02:31.25]And closed my world and never opened
[02:33.86]Up to anything
[02:36.01]That could get me along
[02:37.67]
[02:38.73]I had to close down everything
[02:40.92]I had to close down my mind
[02:43.16]Too many things to cover me
[02:45.60]Too much can make me blind
[02:48.03]I‘ve seen so much in so many places
[02:50.32]So many heartaches, so many faces
[02:52.73]So many dirty things
[02:55.14]You couldn‘t even believe
[02:57.10]
[02:57.88]I would stand in line for this
[03:02.76]It‘s always good in life for this
[03:06.31]
[03:07.63]Oh baby, oh baby
[03:11.24]Then it fell apart, fell apart
[03:17.18]Oh baby, oh baby
[03:21.43]Then it fell apart, it fell apart
[03:26.72]Oh baby, oh baby
[03:31.38]Then it fell apart, it fell apart
[03:36.26]Oh baby, oh baby
[03:40.84]Like it always does, always does
