[00:19.00]Title: Through the Never
[00:36.98]All that is, was and will be
[00:40.16]Universe much too big to see
[00:45.12]
[00:46.92]Time and space never ending
[00:49.61]Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
[00:52.15]Limitations of human understanding
[00:54.92]Too quick to criticize
[00:58.43]Obligation to survive
[01:01.13]We hunger to be alive
[01:03.83]
[01:11.10]All that is, ever
[01:13.20]Ever was
[01:14.77]Will be ever
[01:16.28]Twisting
[01:16.95]Turning
[01:17.62]Through the never
[01:19.21]
[01:30.62]In the dark, see past our eyes
[01:35.35]Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
[01:38.93]
[01:40.54]Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
[01:43.14]On a quest, meaning, reason
[01:45.66]Came to be, how it begun
[01:49.84]All alone in the family of the sun
[01:52.36]Curiosity teasing everyone
[01:54.92]On our home, third stone from the sun
[01:58.32]
[02:03.46]All that is, ever
[02:05.36]Ever was
[02:06.83]Will be ever
[02:08.47]Twisting
[02:09.17]Turning
[02:09.84]Through the never
[02:12.34]
[03:13.36]On through the never
[03:17.26]We must go
[03:18.64]On through the never
[03:22.28]Out to the
[03:23.80]Edge of forever
[03:27.49]We must go
[03:28.95]On through the never
[03:32.53]Then never comes
[03:34.68]
[03:43.71]All that is, ever
[03:45.57]Ever was
[03:47.12]Will be ever
[03:48.67]Twisting
[03:49.42]Turning
[03:50.03]Who we are
[03:50.82]Ask forever
[03:52.08]Twisting
[03:52.86]Turning
[03:53.45]Through the never
[03:59.44]Never
