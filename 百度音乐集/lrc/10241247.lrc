[00:04.00]SOUL KITCHEN
[00:05.53]
[00:29.26]Well, the clock says it's time to close now
[00:37.76]I guess I'd better go now
[00:46.26]I'd really like to stay here all night
[00:54.25]The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
[00:58.77]Street lights share their hollow glow
[01:02.48]Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
[01:06.80]Still one place to go
[01:10.82]Still one place to go
[01:13.33]
[01:14.45]Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
[01:19.31]Warm my mind near your gentle stove
[01:23.20]Turn me out and I'll wander baby
[01:27.34]Stumblin' in the neon groves
[01:31.27]
[01:31.49]Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
[01:35.20]Speak in secret alphabets
[01:39.08]I light another cigarette
[01:43.42]Learn to forget, learn to forget
[01:51.64]Learn to forget, learn to forget
[01:57.92]
[01:59.67]Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
[02:04.31]Warm my mind near your gentle stove
[02:07.88]Turn me out and I'll wander baby
[02:11.73]Stumblin' in the neon groves
[02:14.53]
[02:56.35]Well the clock says it's time to close now
[03:04.65]I know I have to go now
[03:12.84]I really want to stay here
[03:17.30]All night, all night, all night
