[01:33.78][00:52.44][00:00.30] See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
[01:37.01][00:54.75][00:02.24] But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
[01:39.30][00:57.12][00:04.43] And though my heart can't take no more,
[01:41.27][00:59.28][00:06.46] I can't keep running back to you
[01:44.37][01:02.06][00:09.60] See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
[01:47.27][01:05.03][00:12.34] But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)

[00:20.60] (And another one....what? what?)
[Ashanti:]
[00:31.53] I think I found my strenght to finally get up and leave
[00:35.04] No more broken heart for me
[00:38.63] No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)
[00:41.00] I'm lookin' like I got my head on right so now I see
[00:45.67] No more givin' you everythin'
[00:48.60] There's no more takin' my love from me (what?)
[Chorus]
[Ashanti:]
[01:12.68] Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
[01:17.24] No more waiting late up at night
[01:20.38] No more havin' to fuzz and fight
[01:22.85] I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
[01:28.26] No more thinkin' about what you do
[01:30.68] There's no more of me runnin' back to you
[Chorus]
[Biggie:]
[01:55.03] Some say the x make the sex spec-tacular,
[01:57.13] Let me lick you from yo neck to yo back
[02:00.48] Then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
[02:02.73] Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
[02:04.82] Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
[02:07.36] If its alright wit' you, we fuckin (that's cool)
[02:10.11] Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
[02:13.24] Pissy off Bacardi Dark
[02:14.56] Remember when I used to play between yo legs
[02:17.09] You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
[02:19.61] Straight to yo mother's bed
[02:20.77] At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
[02:24.63] Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
[02:28.80] Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
[02:31.62] Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian, trips to the Carribean
[02:35.41] But tonight, no ends
[Ashanti (Biggie)]
[02:37.14] You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
[02:41.68] While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
[02:46.06] But I'm leaving you tonight
[02:48.65] See my days are cold without you
[02:50.96] But I'm hurting while I'm with you
[02:53.40] And though my heart can't take no more,
[02:55.48] I can't keep running back to you
[02:59.42] You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
[03:02.80] While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
[03:07.04] But I'm leaving you tonight (Uuuh...and another one)
[03:11.54]
[03:13.60] END
