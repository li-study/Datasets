[00:06.56]Under The Iron Sea
[00:09.59]12th June, 2006
[00:13.59]
[00:20.76]An old fairytale told me
[00:26.13]The simple heart will be prized again
[00:30.21]A toad will be our king
[00:34.01]An ugly ogres our heroes
[00:38.06]
[00:38.24]Then you'll shake your fist at the sky
[00:45.30]"Oh why did I rely
[00:49.27]On fashions and small fry?"
[00:56.73]All promises broken
[00:56.97]
[01:00.84]Feed your people or lose your throne
[01:05.24]And forfeit your whole kingdom
[01:09.34]I'd sooner lose it than still live in it alone
[01:15.83]You were our golden child
[01:19.78]But the gentle and the mild
[01:24.20]Inherit the earth
[01:28.91]While your princes's crown cracks and falls down
[01:29.00]
[01:42.03]Your castle hollow and cold
[01:48.76]You've wandered so far from the person you are
[01:59.71]Let go, brother, let go
[02:06.30]Because now we all know
[02:13.35]
[02:15.16]Soon someone will put a spell on you
[02:23.62]Perfume, treasure, sorcery, every trick they know
[02:33.33]You will lie in a deep sleep
[02:39.15]
[02:39.21]That's when your prince's crown cracks and falls down
[02:52.09]Your castle hollow and cold
[02:58.59]You've wandered so far from the person you are
[03:09.58]Let go, brother, let go
[03:16.09]Because now we all know
[03:24.63]
