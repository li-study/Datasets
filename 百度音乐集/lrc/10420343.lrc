[00:00.09]Stardust
[00:04.48]- Kenny Rogers
[00:07.35]
[00:09.31]And now the purple dusk of twilight time
[00:15.18]Steals across the meadows of my heart
[00:21.74]High up in the sky the little stars climb
[00:27.99]Always reminding me that we're apart
[00:33.39]
[00:35.02]You wander down the lane and far away
[00:40.46]Leaving me a song that will not die
[00:46.78]Love is now the stardust of yesterday
[00:52.90]The music of the years gone by
[00:57.20]
[00:58.00]Sometimes I wonder why I spend
[01:05.95]The lonely night dreaming of a song
[01:12.66]The melody haunts my reverie
[01:19.55]And I am once again with you
[01:25.04]When our love was new
[01:29.59]And each kiss an inspiration
[01:37.45]But that was long ago
[01:40.56]Now my consolation
[01:44.03]Is in the stardust of a song
[01:48.32]
[01:49.87]Beside a garden wall
[01:55.41]When stars are bright
[01:59.57]You are in my arms
[02:02.45]The nightingale tells his fairy tale
[02:09.32]A paradise where roses bloom
[02:14.77]Though I dream in vain
[02:20.91]In my heart it will remain
[02:27.19]My stardust melody
[02:31.18]The memory of love's refrain
[02:36.37](------ Music ------)
[03:04.50]Though I dream in vain
[03:10.82]In my heart it will remain
[03:17.11]My stardust melody
[03:21.12]The memory of love's refrain
[03:34.67]
