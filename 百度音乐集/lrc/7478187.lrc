[00:12.00]
[00:35.54]Don't you understand me, baby?
[00:41.42]There'll never be no one else but you
[00:47.35]Can't you understand me, baby?
[00:54.54]There'll never be no other one but you
[01:00.06]I loved you then and I love you now, baby
[01:04.32]And no one else will ever do
[01:09.25]
[01:11.33]Every time the sun goes down, baby
[01:17.41]My love, my love comes down for you
[01:22.97]Every time it rain, baby
[01:29.22]My love it comes down for you
[01:34.53]There ain't no other woman, baby
[01:38.84]That can understand me the way you do
[01:44.47]
[01:46.16]If you would only listen to me, baby
[01:52.17]We would still be together today
[01:57.96]If you would only, only listen to me, baby
[02:04.00]We would still be together today
[02:08.89]But instead of listening to me
[02:13.09]You listen to everything other people have to say
[02:18.68]
[03:28.04]Baby, please come home
[03:32.69]There's nobody in your place
[03:39.40]Aye baby, please come home
[03:45.55]There's nobody in your place
[03:51.41]Home is no home to me, baby
[03:55.63]Without looking in your smiling face
[04:00.65]
[04:01.61]Oh, I love you so much, baby
[04:07.54]My love for you will never die
[04:15.35]I love you, I love you, I love you so much, baby
[04:21.18]My love for you will never die
[04:25.53]And when it began raining, baby
[04:30.61]My love is down like a Incomprehensible
[04:36.32]
