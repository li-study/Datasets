[00:00.10]John Mayer - Back To You
[00:18.90]
[00:20.98]Back to you
[00:22.98]It always comes around
[00:25.60]Back to you
[00:27.96]I tried to forget you
[00:30.18]I tried to stay away
[00:33.40]But it's too late
[00:37.15]
[00:39.64]Over you
[00:41.65]I'm never over
[00:44.25]Over you
[00:46.55]Something about you
[00:48.89]It's just the way you move
[00:51.90]The way you move me
[00:55.67]
[00:57.34]Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
[01:03.50]And I quit every game I play
[01:08.40]But forgive me, love
[01:12.11]I can't turn and walk away this way
[01:17.01]
[01:35.77]Back to you
[01:37.86]It always comes around
[01:40.58]Back to you
[01:42.81]I walk with your shadow
[01:45.28]I'm sleeping in my bed
[01:48.10]With your silhouette
[01:51.86]
[01:53.48]Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
[01:59.65]If it's the last that I'll see of you
[02:04.58]It's the least that you
[02:08.45]Could not do
[02:10.91]
[02:19.16]Leave the light on
[02:23.61]I'll never give up on you
[02:28.78]Leave the light on
[02:32.38]For me too... yeah
[02:51.83]
[03:07.22]Back to me
[03:09.39]I know that it comes
[03:11.88]Back to me
[03:14.24]Doesn't it scare you
[03:16.49]Your will is not as strong
[03:19.57]As it used to be
