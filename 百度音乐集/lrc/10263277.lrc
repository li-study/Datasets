[00:00.70]Carpenters
[00:00.80]
[00:01.00]I'll say goodbye to love
[00:05.00]No one ever cared if I should live or die
[00:12.00]Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
[00:17.00]And all I know of love is how to live without it
[00:23.21]I just can't seem to find it
[00:28.00]So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
[00:33.50]And though it's not the easy way I guess I've always know
[00:39.00]I'd say goodbye to love
[00:44.00]There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
[00:49.00]Surely time will lose these bitter memories
[00:54.00]And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
[00:59.04]And to live for something I could live for
[01:06.26]All the years of useless search
[01:08.90]Have finally reached an end
[01:11.56] Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
[01:16.76]
[01:17.89]From this day love is forgotten
[01:20.24]I'll go on as best I can
[01:25.34]
[01:49.47]What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
[01:55.21]No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
[02:01.16]There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
[02:06.59]But for now this is my song
[02:10.68]And it's goodbye to love
[02:16.71]I'll say goodbye to love
[02:21.28]
