[00:31.37]I wish I was in Carrickfergus
[00:40.17]Where the castle looks out to sea.
[00:48.55]I would swim over the deepest ocean
[00:56.90]For my love to be with me.
[01:05.45]But the sea is wide and I can not swim over
[01:13.90]Nor have I the wings to fly
[01:21.94]I wish I had a handsome boatman,
[01:29.95]To ferry me over, my love and I.
[01:54.90]I wish I was in the land of Eire,
[02:03.45]Where the mountains reach the sea.
[02:11.23]Where flowers blossom as I do remember.
[02:20.03]Where my true love came to me.
[02:28.03]But the sea is wide and I can not swim over.
[02:36.54]Nor have I the wings to fly.
[02:44.61]Ahh to be back now in Carrickfergus
[03:01.27][02:53.04]To be together .. my love and I.
[03:25.76]I wish I was in Carrickfergus,
[03:34.23]To be together my love and I.
[03:54.82]I wish I was back home again.
