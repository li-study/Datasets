[00:01.98]Puke
[00:02.55]Eminem
[00:03.18]
[00:19.33]There I go, thinkin of you again...
[00:22.09]
[00:23.51]You dont know how sick you make me
[00:29.49]you make me fuckin sick to my stomach
[00:32.85]every time i think of you i puke
[00:35.82]you must just not know
[00:41.35]you may not think you do but you do
[00:44.54]every time i think of you i puke
[00:46.33]I was gonna take the time to sit down
[00:48.43]and write you a little poem
[00:50.45]but ??? would probably be a little more
[00:53.68]more suitable for this type of song
[00:58.46]i got a million reasons off the top of my head
[01:01.06]that i could think of
[01:02.16]16 bars just aint enough to put some ink to
[01:05.14]so fuck it im'a start right here and just be brief
[01:08.30]about to rattle off some other reasons
[01:10.12]i knew i shouldn't go and get another tattoo
[01:13.12]of you on my arm, but what do i go and do?
[01:16.05]I go and get another one, now i got two
[01:21.91]now im sittin here with your name on my skin
[01:24.83]i cant believe i went and did this stupid shit again
[01:27.71]my next girlfriend, now here name's gotta be kim..shit
[01:33.57]if you only knew how much i hated you
[01:36.51]for every motherfuckin thing you ever put us through
[01:39.43]then i wouldnt be standin here cryin over you
[01:44.85]
[01:45.28]You dont know how sick you make me
[01:51.55]you make me fuckin sick to my stomach
[01:54.93]every time i think of you i puke
[01:56.99]you must just not know
[02:03.25]you may not think you do but you do
[02:06.17]every time i think of you i puke
[02:08.25]I was gonna take the time to sit down
[02:10.53]and write you a little letter
[02:12.46]but i thought a song would probably be a little better
[02:15.34]instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up..yea
[02:20.41]i stumbled on your picture yesterday and made me stop and think of
[02:24.18]how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
[02:27.12]a stupid piece of paper, i'd rather let you see how
[02:30.24]much i fuckin hate you in a freestyle
[02:32.20]your a fuckin cokehead and i hope you fuckin die
[02:34.94]i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
[02:37.94]i hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut i hope you die..die
[02:43.84]but please dont get me wrong, im not bitter or mad
[02:46.76]its not that i still love you its not cause i want you back
[02:49.61]its just that when i think of you it makes me wanna yack...yack
[02:55.38]but what else can i do, i haven't got a clue
[02:58.67]now i guess i'll just move on i have no choice but to
[03:01.41]but everytime i think of you now all i wanna do is puke
[03:06.91]
[03:07.20]You dont know how sick you make me
[03:13.52]you make me fuckin sick to my stomach
[03:16.85]every time i think of you i puke
[03:18.89]you must just not know
[03:25.20]you may not think you do but you do
[03:28.34]every time i think of you i puke
[03:32.13]
