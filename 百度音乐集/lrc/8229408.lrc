[00:00.00]There's something I can't quite explain
[00:05.58]I'm so in love with you
[00:10.36]You'll never take that away
[00:15.65]And if I've said it a hundred times before
[00:23.12]Expect a thousand more
[00:28.38]You'll never take that away
[00:32.19]So expect me to be calling you to see
[00:36.14]If you're okay when I'm not around
[00:38.58]Asking "if you love me"
[00:40.81]I love the way you make it sound
[00:43.29]Calling you to see
[00:45.03]Do I try too hard to make you smile?
[00:48.01]To make us smile
[00:50.92]I will keep calling you to see
[00:55.51]If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
[00:58.53]If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
[01:01.52]I can't believe you actually picked me
[01:09.91]I thought that the world had lost it's sway
[01:15.21]It's so hard sometimes
[01:17.91]Then I fell in love with you
[01:20.22]Then came you
[01:21.79]And you took that away
[01:23.38]It's not so difficult
[01:25.02]The world is not so difficult
[01:28.01]You take away the old
[01:30.63]Show me the new
[01:32.46]And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
[01:36.92]So while I'm on this phone
[01:39.48]A hundred miles from home
[01:41.70]I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you
[01:45.26]I only want to see
[01:47.01]If you're okay when I'm not around
[01:49.39]Asking "if you love me"
[01:51.56]I love the way you make it sound
[01:53.98]Calling you to see
[01:55.83]Do I try too hard to make you smile?
[01:59.16]To make us smile
[02:01.69]I will keep calling you to see
[02:06.61]If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
[02:09.01]If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
[02:12.19]I can't believe you actually picked me
[02:39.25]I will keep calling you to see
[02:43.67]If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
[02:46.31]If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
[02:49.48]I can't believe you actually picked me
