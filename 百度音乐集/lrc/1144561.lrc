[00:01.00]Alone
[00:11.00]Bee Gees
[00:18.00]I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
[00:22.00]I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
[00:27.00]I was an iron man
[00:29.00]I had a master plan
[00:31.00]But I was alone
[00:34.00]I could hear you breathing
[00:38.00]With a sigh of the wind
[00:40.00]I remember how your body started trembling
[00:44.00]Oh, what's a night it's been
[00:47.00]And for the state I'm in
[00:49.00]I'm still alone
[03:05.00][00:52.00]And all the wonders made for the Earth
[03:09.00][00:57.00]And all the hearts in all creation
[01:01.00]Somehow I always end up alone
[01:04.00]Always end up alone
[03:18.00][02:31.00][01:10.00]So I play, I'll wait
[01:14.00]'Cause you know that love takes time
[03:27.00][02:39.00][01:19.00]We came so far
[01:23.00]Just the beat of a lonely heart
[03:36.00][02:48.00][01:27.00]And it's mine
[03:41.00][02:55.00][01:33.00]I don't want to be alone
[01:43.00]Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
[01:47.00]And since you're busy every minute.
[01:49.00]I just stay at home
[01:52.00]I make believe you care
[01:54.00]I feel you everywhere
[01:56.00]But I'm still alone
[02:00.00]I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
[02:05.00]'Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate
[02:09.00]Am I the subject of the pain
[02:11.00]Am I the stranger in the rain
[02:13.00]I am alone
[02:17.00]And if there glory there to behold
[02:22.00]Maybe it's my imagination
[03:14.00][02:26.00]Another story there to be told
[03:22.00][02:35.00]And I pray it's not too late
[03:31.00][02:43.00]Just a beat of a lonely heart
[03:45.00]Gone, but not out of sight
[03:48.00]I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
[03:54.00]Face the heat of the night
[03:56.00]The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
[04:02.00]Shine and search for the light
[04:05.00]And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
