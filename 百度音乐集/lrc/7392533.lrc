[00:01.48]The Kinks "Sunny Afternoon"歌词
[00:04.00]
[00:15.00]The tax man's taken all my dough
[00:19.00]And left me in my stately home
[00:23.00]Lazing on a sunny afternoon
[00:28.15]And i can't sail my yacht
[00:31.00]He's taken everything i've got
[00:35.00]All i've got's this sunny afternoon
[00:43.00]Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
[00:49.96]I got a big fat mama
[00:53.48]trying to break me
[00:58.00]And i love to live so pleasantly
[01:02.74]Live this life of luxury
[01:06.97]Lazing on a sunny afternoon
[01:14.00]In the summertime
[01:17.49]In the summertime
[01:21.84]In the summertime
[01:26.00]My girlfriend's run off with my car
[01:30.06]And gone back to her ma and pa
[01:33.84]Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty.
[01:38.94]Now i'm sitting here
[01:42.00]Sipping at my ice cold beer
[01:45.78]Lazing on a sunny afternoon
[01:53.31]Help me, help me, help me sail away
[02:01.00]Well give me two good reasons
[02:03.00]why i oughta stay
[02:08.00]'cause i love to live so pleasantly
[02:12.50]Live this life of luxury
[02:16.40]Lazing on a sunny afternoon
[02:24.15]In the summertime
[02:28.09]In the summertime
[02:31.00]In the summertime
[02:35.12]Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
[02:43.00]I got a big fat mama
[02:44.54]trying to break me
[02:51.00]And i love to live so pleasantly
[02:54.76]Live this life of luxury
[02:58.62]Lazing on a sunny afternoon
[03:05.91]In the summertime
[03:10.00]In the summertime
[03:13.03]In the summertime
