[00:00.00]Mariah Carey - Through The Rain
[00:14.50]
[00:16.50]When you get caught in the rain
[00:20.97]With no where to run
[00:24.23]When you're distraught and in pain
[00:28.89]Without anyone
[00:31.82]When you keep crying out to be saved
[00:36.73]But nobody comes and you feel so far away
[00:44.65]That you just can't find your way home
[00:50.12]You can get there alone
[00:53.61]It's okay, what you say is
[03:30.40][02:21.61][01:03.16]I can make it through the rain
[03:34.17][02:25.63][01:07.41]I can stand up once again on my own
[03:40.00][02:31.49][01:13.13]And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
[03:45.77][02:37.33][01:18.96]And every time I feel afraid
[03:49.93][02:41.14][01:22.95]I hold tighter to my faith
[03:53.83][02:45.22][01:26.95]And I live one more day
[03:57.89][02:49.15][01:30.93]And I make it through the rain
[01:36.46]
[01:50.26]And if you keep falling down
[01:55.18]Don't you dare give in
[01:58.12]You will arise safe and sound
[02:02.89]So keep pressing on steadfastly
[02:08.48]And you'll find what you need to prevail
[02:16.25]What you say is
[02:52.64]And when the rain blows
[02:56.43]As shadows grow close don't be afraid
[03:02.93]There's nothing you can't face
[03:08.26]And should they tell you
[03:12.00]You'll never pull through
[03:15.70]Don't hesitate
[03:19.38]Stand tall and say
[04:01.81]I can make it through the rain
[04:06.03]And I live once again
[04:09.85]And I live one more day
[04:13.07]And I can make it through the rain
[04:24.37](Ohhh yes you can)
[04:28.81]
[04:30.77]You will make it through the rain
[04:43.89]
