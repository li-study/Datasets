[00:05.59]演唱：阿桑
[00:07.03]
[00:11.01]Spend all your time waiting
[00:15.53]For that second chance
[00:18.78]For a break that would make it okay
[00:23.89]There's always some reason
[00:27.57]To feel not good enough
[00:31.07]And it's hard at the end of the day
[00:36.10]I need some distraction
[00:39.82]Oh beautiful release
[00:43.95]Memories seep from my veins
[00:48.43]And may be empty
[00:52.22]Oh and weightless and maybe
[00:56.74]I'll find some peace tonight
[01:01.93]In the arms of the angel
[01:07.30]
[01:07.95]Fly away from here
[01:13.74]From this dark  cold hotel room
[01:20.26]And the endlessness that you fear
[01:26.27]You are pulled from the wreckage
[01:32.89]Of your silent reverie
[01:39.85]You're in the arms of the angel
[01:46.01]May you find  some comfort here
[01:57.61]
[02:03.17]So tired of the straight line
[02:08.22]And everywhere you turn
[02:11.88]Cause vultures and thieves at your back
[02:17.02]The storm keeps on twisting
[02:20.71]Keep on buliding the lies
[02:24.37]That you make up for all that you lack
[02:29.42]It don't make no difference
[02:34.41]Escape one last time
[02:38.52]It's easier   to believe
[02:43.43]In this sweet madness
[02:46.79]Oh, this glorious sadness
[02:51.07]That brings me to my kness
[02:57.15]In the arms of the angel
[03:02.62]Fly away from here
[03:08.82]From this dark  cold hotel room
[03:09.97]
[03:14.78]And the endlessness that you fear
[03:21.23]You are pulled from the wreckage
[03:27.19]Of your silent reverie
[03:34.51]You're in the arms of the angel
[03:40.16]May you find  some comfort here
[03:52.86]You're in the arms of the angel
[03:58.82]May you find  some comfort here
[04:10.41]
