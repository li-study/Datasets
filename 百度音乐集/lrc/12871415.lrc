[00:00.00]go on and wring my neck
[00:03.67]like when a rag gets wet
[00:05.84]a little discipline
[00:07.46]for my pet genius
[00:11.00]my head is like a lettuce
[00:12.56]go on and dig your thumbs in
[00:14.91]i cannot stop giving
[00:16.96]i'm thirty-something
[00:18.42]sense of security
[00:20.92]like pockets jingling
[00:23.48]midlife crisis
[00:27.74]suck ingenuity
[00:29.66]down through the family tree
[00:36.29]you're perfect, yes, it's true
[00:38.74]but without me you're only you
[00:43.95]your menstruating heart
[00:48.30]it ain't bleeding enough for two
[00:55.31]it's a midlife crisis...
[01:12.47]what an inheritance
[01:14.46]the salt and the kleenex
[01:16.73]morbid self attention
[01:18.99]bending my pinky back
[01:21.04]a little discipline
[01:23.25]a donor by habit
[01:25.50]a little discipline
[01:27.83]rent an opinion
[01:30.09]sense of security
[01:32.09]holding blunt instrument
[01:35.05]i'm a perfectionist
[01:38.95]and perfect is a skinned knee
[01:47.42]you're perfect, yes, it's true
[01:50.78]but without me you're only you
[01:55.35]your menstruating heart
[01:59.73]it ain't bleeding enough for two
[02:07.79]it's a midlife crisis...............
