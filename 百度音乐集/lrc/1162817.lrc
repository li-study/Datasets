[00:25.01]Fool just another
[00:25.66]fool just another
[00:35.22]I've been waiting
[00:37.52]for signs of god
[00:40.01]create- enslaved- behaved-
[00:50.03]everything is out of control
[01:05.22]Leave me alone
[01:07.05]isolation bears hope
[01:10.10]there's something else waiting
[01:13.06]a promised destiny
[01:15.38]freezing me
[01:16.32]I feel restless and low
[01:19.56]these days full of sadness
[01:22.51]had joyfully changed
[01:25.07]into fear
[01:27.55]My freakshow will start tonight
[01:32.85]don't miss the right time
[01:34.35]
[01:35.48]Bright eyes
[01:37.93]blinded by fear of life
[01:42.95]no Merlin is by my side
[01:46.04]everything is out of control
[01:48.63]everything is out of control
[01:53.65]in my future plans
[01:56.19]everything is out of control
[01:58.31]noone's left to hurt
[02:01.09]everything is out of control
[02:03.18]sorrow's gone away
[02:06.37]Broken memories
[02:07.67]walking upstairs
[02:08.93]step by step
[02:13.29]I see the whole world burning
[02:15.21]the poet dies in Neverland
[02:16.24]how it burns
[02:17.89]Hey, mother stubborn
[02:19.22]I really hate you
[02:21.37]if you say yes I will say no
[02:27.11]ashes to ashes
[02:29.05]but dust won't be dust
[02:30.94]if you go there
[02:34.16]I will go back
[02:35.83]
[02:37.02]Bright eyes
[02:38.97]blinded by fear of life
[02:44.15]betrayed by sunrise
[02:46.82]bright eyes
[02:49.36]blinded by fear of life
[02:54.21]no Merlin is by my side
[02:57.21]
[03:50.21]watching me, watching you
[03:55.21]
[04:01.37]Hey, father stubborn
[04:03.52]you're ying
[04:04.22]and I'm young
[04:05.10]I feel alone
[04:08.05]who really cares
[04:10.70]Born into ashes
[04:12.82]to lose all the games
[04:14.92]with a smiling face
[04:17.67]
[04:21.39]Bright eyes
[04:23.47]blinded by fear of life
[04:28.35]and dark dragons rise
[04:30.85]bright eyes
[04:33.66]blinded by fear of life
[04:38.45]no Merlin is by my side
[04:42.16]So I sit still in my room, today
[04:47.27]winter's here
[04:49.35]in summer's season
[04:52.35]shall I say
[04:53.84]I was wrong
[04:55.38]if I'm right
[04:59.93]farewell to my last hope
