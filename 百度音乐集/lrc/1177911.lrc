[00:42.74]Napalm showers
[00:44.52]Showed the cowards
[00:46.21]We weren't there to mess around
[00:49.43]
[00:49.85]Through heat exhaustion
[00:51.48]And mind distortion
[00:53.31]A military victory mounted on innocent ground
[00:57.48]
[00:57.84]Hearing voices from miles away
[01:01.65]Saying things never said
[01:04.94]Seeing shadows in the light of the day
[01:08.52]Waging a war inside my head
[01:12.01]
[01:16.48]Waging a war inside my head
[01:19.68]
[01:25.67]Years and years of
[01:27.13]Bloodshed and warfare
[01:28.94]Our mission was only to get in and kill
[01:32.08]
[01:32.48]A free vacation
[01:34.08]Of palmtrees and shrapnel
[01:36.06]Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell
[01:36.96]
[01:40.46]Hearing voices from miles away
[01:44.33]Saying things never said
[01:47.57]Seeing shadows in the light of the day
[01:51.23]Waging a war inside my head
[01:54.06]
[01:54.79]Feeling strangers staring my way
[01:58.40]Reading minds never read
[02:01.84]Tasting danger with each word I say
[02:05.47]Waging a war inside my head
