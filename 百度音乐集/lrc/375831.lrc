[00:11.37]Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
[00:20.95]meltin' in a pot of thieves
[00:25.72]wild card up my sleeve
[00:30.34]thick heart of stone
[00:33.75]my sins my own
[00:36.12]they belong to me, me
[00:41.55]
[00:42.92]people say \"beware!\"
[00:47.28]but I don't care
[00:51.86]the words are just
[00:53.66]rules and regulations to me, me
[00:59.62]
[01:00.30]I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud
[01:09.19]I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
[01:17.37]and I go to this here party and I just get bored
[01:24.37]until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
[01:29.06]humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
[01:32.84]oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
[01:40.33]and I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
[01:45.99]ooh I'll put my spell on her
[01:48.82]
[01:49.16]here she comes
[01:50.71]walkin' down the street
[01:52.35]here she comes
[01:54.03]comin' through my door
[01:55.76]here she comes
[01:57.47]crawlin' up my stair
[01:59.19]here she comes
[02:00.87]waltzin' through the hall
[02:02.68]in a pretty red dress
[02:04.97]and oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
[02:11.30]and I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
[02:15.96]
[02:16.52]and then I hear this knockin' on my door
[02:20.94]hear this knockin' on my door
[02:24.49]and I look up into the big tower clock
[02:27.47]and say, \"oh my God here's midnight!\"
[02:31.00]and my baby is walkin' through the door
[02:34.40]leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
[02:39.59]and oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
[02:45.97]and I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine
[02:49.99]
[02:51.64]and I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
[02:55.61]she whispered to me, she told me her name
[02:58.65]and her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is G-L-O-R-I-A

[03:34.90]I was at the stadium
[03:37.40]There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
[03:40.66]Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth
[03:43.81]I didn't hear them I didn't see
[03:47.05]I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
[03:49.99]and I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
[03:53.23]going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
[03:56.68]ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
[03:59.92]counting the time, then you came to my room
[04:05.82]and you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
[04:09.73]and oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
[04:15.97]and I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
[04:20.77]make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine

[04:36.76]
[04:38.39]and the tower bells chime, \"ding dong\" they chime
[04:50.83]they're singing, \"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.\"
