[00:02.00]The Maccabees - William Powers
[00:03.00]
[00:06.62]There is love
[00:09.29]There is lust
[00:12.38]There is love fuelled lust
[00:15.02]Little thing called trust
[00:16.66]Which I must not break, for you
[00:23.19]Forsaking all others but you
[00:28.25]
[00:29.41]There are storms
[00:33.44]I must brave
[00:36.05]There are things I must do
[00:38.96]Things I must not do to break, for you
[00:46.83]Forsake all others for you
[00:52.20]
[00:53.83]And I'll see you when you're older
[00:58.43]When we're older
[01:00.65]And I'll see you when you're older
[01:04.23]When we're older
[01:06.25]
[01:07.01]Strong arms they held you to it
[01:10.54]That's what they are singing in the shadows
[01:13.99]There's all this nonsense in the dark
[01:16.68]
[01:18.69]We may bend
[01:21.44]No doubt stretch
[01:24.36]Pull at the seams
[01:26.86]Of these four legged jeans
[01:28.21]For what is at stake
[01:29.54]I will not break, for you
[01:34.92]Forsake all others for you
[01:41.28]
[01:42.43]And I'll see you when you're older
[01:46.52]When we're older
[01:48.58]And I'll see you when you're older
[01:52.11]When we're older
[01:54.11]
[01:55.47]And in faith I left you to it
[01:58.48]That's what they sing in the shadows
[02:02.24]There's all this nonsense in the dark
[02:05.15]Left you in strong arms
[02:07.42]Two strong arms that held you through it
[02:12.19]And I blew it
[02:15.50]And I blew it
[02:17.28]
[02:30.59]Now now now now now
[02:33.40]There's something in it
[02:35.20]Now now now now now
[02:36.85]We've grown up with it
[02:38.48]Now now now now now
[02:40.53]We know, if that's enough
[02:43.10]Then that's enough for now
[02:46.80]
