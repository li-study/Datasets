[00:11]Baby
[00:18]Even in my heart
[00:21]I see
[00:24]You're not being true to me
[00:27]Deep within my soul
[00:31]I feel
[00:34]Nothing's like it used to be
[02:51][01:34][00:37]Sometimes I wish I could
[02:55][01:38][00:40]Turn back time
[02:58][01:41][00:43]Impossible as it may seem
[03:01][01:44][00:46]But I wish I could
[03:04][01:48][00:50]So bad
[03:07][02:37][01:50][00:52]Baby
[01:52]You better

[02:44]Quit playin games
[03:20][02:03][01:07]I should have known from the start
[01:16]I live my life
[01:19]The way
[01:22]To keep you coming back to me
[01:25]Everything I do
[01:29]Is for you
[01:32]So what is it you can't see
[02:26][02:15]Baby baby
[02:17]The love that we had
[02:19]Was so strong
[02:21]Don't leave me hanging here forever
[02:27]This is my ride
[02:29]Let's stop this tonight
