[00:01.63]Howdy people?
[00:03.13]Here's a little story about an old friend of mine
[00:08.12]And to all you great folks out there
[00:11.62]This is hardcore 10-4....
[00:15.69]Freaky friday, things ain't going my way
[00:21.23]Everything is gone, my life is a country song
[00:28.07]Oh-oh I jumped out of my bed this morning
[00:34.54] Then I heard this crunchy sound
[00:37.87]From my left leg that was broken
[00:41.39]And a note was laying on the ground
[00:44.71]Baby, I'm leaving you this minute
[00:48.41]Took the car and the cats and dogs
[00:51.74]Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson
[00:55.25]Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck
[01:00.24]Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way
[01:06.34]Everything is gone, my life is a country song
[01:13.37]Freaky Friday, go play on the highway
[01:20.03]Everything is wrong, what the heck is going on
[01:26.87]On my way through crosstown traffic
[01:33.71]I was hit by a giant truck
[01:36.67]I came late to work and got fired
[01:40.55]Then suddenly the thunder struck
[01:43.69]Oh-oh Baby, I am leaving you this minute
[01:47.02]Took the car and the cats and dogs
[01:50.72]Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson
[01:53.86]Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck
[01:59.04]Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way
