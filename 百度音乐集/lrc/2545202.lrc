[00:00.00]Security
[00:00.30]Joss Stone
[00:01.30]A loss that would have thrown
[00:03.73]A hole through anybody's soul
[00:08.25]And you were only human after all
[00:15.23]So don't hold back the tears my dear
[00:17.82]Release them so your eyes can clear
[00:22.44]I know that you will rise again
[00:25.04]But you gotta let them fall
[00:29.38]I wish that I could snap my fingers
[00:32.15]Erase the past but no
[00:35.33]You cannot rewind reality
[00:39.10]Once the tape's unrolled
[00:41.49]<Chorus:>
[00:42.08]If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
[00:49.34]I will help you put the pieces back
[00:53.71]A little more each day
[00:56.35]And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
[01:03.44]Lay your head upon my shoulder
[01:06.96]I'll set you free
[01:08.95]I'll be your security
[01:13.64]~~~~~~
[01:18.80]A moment of despair
[01:21.39]That forces you to say that life's unfair
[01:25.94]It makes you scared of what tomorrow may bring
[01:32.95]But don't go giving into fear
[01:35.51]Stop hiding all alone in there
[01:40.02]The show keeps going on and on
[01:42.60]But you'll miss the whole damn thing
[01:46.99]I wish I had a crystal ball to see what the future holds
[01:52.83]But we don't know how the story ends till it's all been told
[01:59.19]<Chorus:>
[01:59.88]If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
[02:06.93]I will help you put the pieces back
[02:11.36]A little more each day
[02:14.04]And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
[02:21.07]Lay your head upon my shoulder
[02:24.54]I'll set you free
[02:26.31]I'll be your security
[02:29.61]On any clock upon the wall
[02:32.81]The time is always now
[02:36.29]So baby kiss the past goodbye
[02:40.00]Don't let the future blow your mind
[02:43.82]Just sit back and chill
[02:45.98]Take things as they come
[02:49.75]You can't be afraid
[02:51.37]To live for today
[02:53.07]I will be with you each step of the way
[02:56.04]<Chorus:>
[02:56.49]If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
[03:03.41]I will help you put the pieces back
[03:07.89]A little more each day
[03:10.59]And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
[03:17.50]Lay your head upon my shoulder
[03:20.93]I'll set you free
[03:22.80]I'll be your security
[03:24.98]If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
[03:31.60]I will help you put the pieces back
[03:36.16]A little more each day
[03:38.75]And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
[03:45.72]Lay your head upon my shoulder
[03:49.12]I'll set you free
[03:51.32]I'll be your security
[03:55.24]~~~oh~~~
[04:14.04]Lay your head upon my shoulder
[04:17.60]I'll set you free
[04:19.63]I'll be your security
[04:25.04]
