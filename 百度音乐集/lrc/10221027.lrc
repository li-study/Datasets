[00:05.99]
[00:07.99]I saw you coming from a mile away
[00:11.75]Trying to hide behind that pretty face
[00:15.75]Bet my last dollar baby you been bruised
[00:19.24]Poor little heart all black 'n' blue
[00:23.64]Last thing you need's another pickup line
[00:27.51]You must have heard them all a thousand times
[00:31.61]God only knows what you been through
[00:34.98]Believe me I been broken too
[00:39.54]It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away
[00:47.10]I've been around that block a time or two
[00:53.24]Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you
[01:02.54]I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
[01:09.92]Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
[01:13.87]I don't want to make the same mistake it's too late
[01:20.88]I'll leave on the light
[01:23.89]These arms are open all night
[01:28.87]
[01:39.05]I got your taste in the back of my mouth
[01:42.46]I want to reach in and pull it out
[01:46.88]And I'd be lying if I didn't say
[01:50.37]When you're this close I'm afraid
[01:54.78]Of the way I'll feel if I touch your hair
[01:58.64]The way I'll miss you when you're not there
[02:02.74]And that I'll see you when I close my eyes
[02:06.57]It's too late, I've crossed that line
[02:10.76]It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away
[02:18.29]I'll still be around come closing time
[02:26.34]I don't want to fall in love with you
[02:33.78]I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
[02:41.11]Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
[02:45.11]I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late
[02:52.11]I'll leave on the light
[02:55.29]These arms are open all night
[03:00.15][Guitar solo]
[03:14.15]It's 2 am, it's last call, baby.
[03:18.05]The barkeep's gone, I'll walk you home now
[03:21.84]Save me, baby
[03:29.76]I don't want to fall in love with you
[03:37.12]I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
[03:44.60]Please don't make me beg, give this heart a break
[03:48.55]Please don't make me make the same mistake but it's too late
[03:57.52]I'll leave on the light
[04:00.59]These arms are open all night
