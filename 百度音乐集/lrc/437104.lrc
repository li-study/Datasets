[00:01.96]How insensitive
[00:06.83]I must have seemed
[00:09.42]When he told me that he loved me
[00:16.68]How unmoved and cold
[00:22.84]I must have seemed
[00:25.13]When he told me so sincerely
[00:31.63]Why he must have asked
[00:37.86]Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
[00:47.57]What was I to do?
[00:55.76]What can you do
[00:57.11]When a love affair is over?

[02:04.59]Now he's gone away
[02:10.63]And I'm alone
[02:12.88]With a memory of his last look
[02:19.27]Vague and drawn and sad
[02:25.33]I see it still
[02:28.09]All the heartbreak in his last look
[02:34.20]How he must have asked,
[02:40.49]Would I just turn and stare in icy silence
[02:49.65]What was I to do?
[02:55.96]What can one do
[02:58.93]When a love affair is over?
[03:05.36]What was I to do?
[03:11.66]What can one do
[03:14.62]When a love affair is over?
