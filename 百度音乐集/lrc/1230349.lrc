[00:04.33]And love
[00:06.48]Is not the easy thing
[00:08.84]The only baggage
[00:11.25]That you can bring
[00:13.15]Not the easy thing
[00:15.78]The only baggage you can bring
[00:17.77]Is all that you can’t leave behind
[00:42.57]And if the darkness is to keep us apart
[00:51.67]And if the daylight feels like it’s a long way off
[01:01.73]And if your glass heart should crack
[01:06.58]And for a second you turn back
[01:12.22]Oh no, be strong
[01:19.45]Walk on
[01:21.66]Walk on
[01:24.22]What you got, they can’t steal it
[01:27.01]No they can’t even feel it
[01:29.20]Walk on
[01:31.16]Walk on
[01:35.02]Stay safe tonight
[01:40.34]You’re packing a suitcase for a place
[01:44.91]None of us has been
[01:49.47]A place that has to be believed
[01:54.69]To be seen
[01:59.23]You could have flown away
[02:02.82]A singing bird
[02:05.20]In an open cage
[02:07.26]Who will only fly
[02:10.60]Only fly for freedom
[02:16.60]Walk on
[02:18.95]Walk on
[02:21.36]What you got
[02:22.57]You can’t deny it
[02:24.25]Can’t sell it or buy it
[02:26.57]Walk on
[02:28.56]Walk on
[02:32.42]You stay safe tonight
[02:35.95]And I know it aches
[02:39.46]How your heart it breaks
[02:41.31]You can only take so much
[02:46.33]Walk on
[02:57.60]Walk on
[03:12.80]Home
[03:16.56]Hard to know what it is
[03:19.08]If you never had one
[03:22.22]Home
[03:26.19]I can’t say where it is
[03:28.58]But I know I’m going
[03:31.85]Home
[03:34.96]That’s where the hurt is
[03:40.63]And I know it aches
[03:43.39]And your heart it breaks
[03:45.44]You can only take so much
[03:49.89]Walk on
[03:59.23]Leave it behind
[04:03.28]You’ve got to leave it behind
[04:08.95]All that you fashion
[04:11.15]All that you make
[04:13.34]All that you build
[04:16.01]All that you break
[04:18.50]All that you measure
[04:20.78]All that you feel
[04:23.22]All this you can leave behind
[04:28.01]All that you reason
[04:30.33]All that you care It’s only time
[04:32.87]And I’ll never fill up all my mind
[04:37.59]All that you sense
[04:40.04]All that you scheme
[04:42.26]All you dress up
[04:44.73]And all that you see
[04:47.08]All you create
[04:49.51]All that you wreck
[04:51.84]All that you hate
