[00:34.32]This generation got on occupation
[00:35.91]Inspiration
[00:36.57]Cause segregation was the Father of misinformation
[00:39.38]They brought back the nation to its knees
[00:41.65]When some brave souls
[00:42.49]Stood and rolled
[00:43.38]Interlocked elbows
[00:44.82]And they screamed no more
[00:46.33]John Kennedy the President to grassroot workers
[00:49.15]Hollywood to the stage
[00:49.92]To the fast food workers
[00:51.27]And every now and then
[00:52.67]They pull us down again but it's cool
[00:54.59]Cause every forty plus years

[02:22.64]And all the ignorance
[02:23.80]And hatred in the ice just melt
[02:25.55]And for the first time in years
