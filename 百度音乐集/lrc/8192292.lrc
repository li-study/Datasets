[00:01.43]
[00:02.43]Thx Sonic for lyric
[00:03.43]
[00:04.43]When the world had nowhere to run
[00:08.05]Or how to hide
[00:10.52]I've been watching the world as it passes by
[00:13.69]Trying to climb
[00:14.63]but I just can't find my feet
[00:20.92]But I still believe
[00:24.19]
[00:26.55]Doesn't matter what life you lead
[00:30.00]Or the love you need
[00:33.11]Lost in the world as it passes by
[00:35.90]Trying to smile
[00:36.84]but you just can't hide your tears
[00:43.20]Do you still believe
[00:46.14]
[00:48.98]I still believe
[00:52.33]That we can live together
[00:53.66]in a land of broken dreams
[00:59.88]I still believe
[01:03.55]We can put us together
[01:04.81]and pray for all our hopes and dreams
[01:08.42]
[01:10.99]Cause I only wanna let you know how I feel
[01:17.50]Watching the love as it passes by
[01:20.30]Trying to smile
[01:21.17]but I just can't hide my tears
[01:27.63]But I still believe
[01:30.96]
[01:33.46]I still believe
[01:36.74]That we can live together
[01:38.07]in a land of broken dreams
[01:44.46]I still believe
[01:47.85]We can put us together
[01:49.11]and pray for all our hopes and dreams
[01:52.23]Floating on your own star
[01:56.22]They always seems to make you hot
[01:59.12]I put it back together once again
[02:23.37]I still believe
[02:26.82]That we can live together
[02:28.08]in a land of broken dreams
[02:34.32]I still believe
[02:37.87]We can put us together
[02:39.24]and pray for all our hopes and dreams
[02:42.53]
[02:45.59]I still believe
[02:48.99]That we can live together
[02:50.18]in a land of broken dreams
[02:56.54]I still believe
[03:00.10]We can put us together
[03:01.35]and pray for all our hopes and dreams
[03:04.48]Floating on your own star
[03:09.13]
