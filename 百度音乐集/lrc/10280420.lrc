[00:19.30]Whatever happened to Duncan?
[00:23.58]He was a good boy they say
[00:28.01]The girls all wanted him to dance with
[00:31.99]The boys to play to play
[00:37.01]When the policeman came knocking
[00:41.91]She didn＇t know what to say
[00:46.24]Except his shoes and socks were all gone
[00:50.42]It seems he ran away
[00:54.19]
[00:55.14]Oh you fool you fool!
[00:59.47]Don＇t give in to fate
[01:03.66]If this is all we＇ve got to fight for
[01:08.58]Rage my darling, rage!
[01:13.16]Duncan good for you!
[01:17.64]Sad but on your way
[01:21.77]Well the army never turned his crank
[01:26.35]But love sure made him brave
[01:33.38]
[01:50.25]A sweeter infatuation
[01:54.33]Oh you＇d be hard pressed to find
[01:59.07]He loved so deeply and madly
[02:02.95]He nearly lost his mind
[02:07.58]And oh behold the mayor＇s daughter
[02:12.31]She was a treat for the eye
[02:17.10]Why this the only thing to live for
[02:21.07]Just made you want to die!
[02:25.30]
[02:25.90]Oh you fool you fool!
[02:30.58]Don＇t give in to fate
[02:34.51]If this is all we＇ve got to fight for
[02:39.48]Rage my darling, rage!
[02:43.96]Duncan good for you!
[02:48.60]Sad but on your way
[02:52.63]Well the army never turned his crank
[02:57.21]But love sure made him brave
[03:06.82]lalalalala
[03:20.56]This is holy war!
[03:24.34]We must fight and fight again
[03:29.47]And go a thousand times for the sake of love
[03:34.71]But never once in vain
[03:43.37]oh oh
