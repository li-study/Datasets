Pretty brown eyed girl
She's so sweet and naive
She met a boy fell in love
Carved their name out in a tree
What a perfect memory
There's a swing out by the creek
They would meet there
He put a rose in her hair
Then she kissed him on the cheek
Those were the days of innocence
When a boy just liked a girl
But we didn't know the difference
We were livin in our own world
[Chorus]
All alone and then I close my eyes
I think back to that time of my life
When everything that meant anything was you
Messed things up grew up a little too fast
I knew it was much too good to last
Cuz the only thing that meant anything was you
After church one Sunday morning
Near the bottom of the stairs
Hair pressed a pretty white dress
Playing a game of truth or dare
I can still hear my momma saying
Child you need to pray
I knew it was wrong
But it's been so long
Since I felt that way
Those were the days of innocence
When a boy just liked a girl
But we didn't know the difference
We were livin in our own world
[Chorus]
Starry skies under the moonlight
You and I two fireflies enchanted by the night
When I see a rainbow dance across the sky
I feel all warm inside
I get teary eyed
Makes me think about you and I
[Chorus]
