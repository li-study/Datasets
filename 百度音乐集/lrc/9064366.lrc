[00:00]She blinded me with her light
[00:03]It's such a beautiful sight
[00:07]The way she moves like an angel
[00:10]She's got me walking on air
[00:15]Angel eyes
[00:17]Rays of hope that hypnotise
[00:21]They're a blessing in disguise
[00:24]Lightning up my life
[00:31]We can play in our secret hideaway
[00:36]We can go there everyday
[00:40]Time is on your side
[00:44]
[02:19][01:17][00:46]She blinded me with her light
[02:23][01:21][00:50]It 's such a beautiful sight
[02:25][01:24][00:53]The way  she moves like an angel
[02:29][01:27][00:56]She's got me walking  on air
[01:01]Angel eyes
[01:03]There will be no compromise
[01:07]Now that I have realised
[01:11]What they mean to me
[01:15]Oh year...
[02:34][01:32]She brought heaven to me
[02:38][01:36]Just like a symphony
[02:41][01:39]The way she talks like an angel
[02:45][01:43]A language out of this world
[01:48]I'm not a superstitious mind
[01:52]not the spiritual kind
[01:56]But she became a revalation to me
[02:00]She made me believe
[03:22][03:06][02:52][02:05]
[03:28][02:56]She's the sun that make the rainbow
[03:32][03:01]She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
[03:12]She's the thunder,She's the lightning
[03:16]She's the weather that keeps blowing troughout time
