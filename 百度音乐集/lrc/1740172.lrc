[00:16.50]Every morning there's a halo hangin
[00:19.50]from the corner of my girlfriend's four post bed
[00:23.50]
[00:25.50]I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
[00:29.50]the weekend or a one-night stand
[00:32.50]
[00:33.50]Couldn't understand
[00:35.50]
[00:36.50]How to work it out
[00:38.50]
[00:42.50]Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
[00:46.50]and you ripped it out
[00:47.50]
[00:51.50]Something's got me reeling
[00:53.50]Stopped me from believing
[00:55.50]Turn me around again
[00:59.50]Said that we can do it
[01:01.50]You know I wanna do it again
[01:04.50]
[01:09.50]Oh...........
[01:11.50]
[01:12.50]Oh................
[01:13.50]
[01:17.50]Oh.......
[01:18.50]
[01:35.50]Every Morning there's a heartache hanging
[01:38.50]from the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
[01:44.50]I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
[01:47.50]but I never can believe what she said
[01:50.50]
[01:52.50]Something so deceiving
[01:54.50]When you stop believing
[01:56.50]Turn me around again
[02:00.50]Said we couldn't do it
[02:03.50]You know I wanna do it again
[02:05.50]
[02:09.50]Oh...........
[02:12.50]
[02:14.50]Oh..................
[02:15.50]
[02:18.50]Oh...........
[02:21.50]
[02:22.50]Oh..........
[02:23.50]
[02:27.50]She always rights the wrong
[02:31.50]For me
[02:33.50]Baby
[02:36.50]She always rights the wrong
[02:39.50]For me
[02:40.50]
[02:41.50]Every Morning there's a halo hanging
[02:44.50]from the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
[02:49.50]I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
[02:53.50]the weekend or a one-night stand
[02:56.50]
[02:58.50]Every Morning
[03:02.50]Every Morning when I wake up
[03:04.50]
[03:07.50]Every Morning
[03:11.50]Every Morning
[03:13.50]
[03:17.50]Every Morning
[03:21.50]Every Morning
