
[00:00.00]
[00:15.50]I remember all the times
[00:19.20]The good times and the bad
[00:22.00]I'm still holding on to you
[00:24.00]
[00:28.30]Some days I wanna run
[00:32.30]Some times I come undone
[00:34.70]But I still belong to you
[00:37.00]
[00:39.50]That's how I know that
[00:43.00]When I feel like caving in
[00:46.20]My heart my soul is wearing thin
[00:49.00]I just want to give up
[00:52.00]Nothing seems at all to add up
[00:56.60]Can you hear me Lord?
[00:58.40]My face is down upon the floor
[01:02.00]It's then you whisper in my ear
[01:07.00]Be still and know I'm here
[01:10.00]
[01:14.70]I see a side of you my friend
[01:18.00]The same struggles that I have
[01:22.00]My heart goes out to you
[01:24.00]
[01:27.80]I know it's hard to feel alone
[01:31.60]And this world's so unforgiving
[01:34.80]I've been feeling that way too
[01:37.70]
[01:39.40]But I can tell you
[01:43.70]When I feel like caving in
[01:46.00]My heart my soul is wearing thin
[01:49.00]I just want to give up
[01:52.60]Nothing seems at all to add up
[01:56.30]Can you hear me Lord?
[01:59.40]My face is down upon the floor
[02:02.30]It's then you whisper in my ear
[02:06.00]Be still and know I'm here
[02:09.00]
[02:12.00]Is that you?
[02:13.00]Is this me
[02:15.00]It's sometimes hard to believe that
[02:17.00]I am not alone
[02:22.00]
[02:24.70]It's not just you
[02:26.00]And not just me
[02:28.00]We all need to believe that
[02:30.40]We are not alone
[02:36.70]When I feel like caving in
[02:40.00]My heart my soul is wearing thin
[02:43.50]I just want to give up
[02:45.70]Nothing seems at all to add up
[02:50.00]I know you hear me lord.
[02:52.00]When my face is down upon the floor
[02:56.00]It's then you whisper in my ear
[03:00.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:06.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:12.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:18.60]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:25.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:31.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
[03:37.00]Be still and know I'm here.  We are not alone.
