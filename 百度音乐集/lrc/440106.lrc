[00:19.28]I feel the earth move under my feet
[00:24.68]I feel the sky tumbling down
[00:29.56]I feel my heart start to trembling
[00:33.54]Whenever you're around
[00:38.38]
[00:39.55]Oh baby When I see your face
[00:45.43]Mellow as the month of May
[00:48.78]Oh darling I cant stand it
[00:54.07]When you look at me that way
[00:59.27]I feel the earth move under my feet
[01:04.22]I feel the sky tumbling down
[01:08.87]I feel my heart start to trembling
[01:13.03]Whenever you're around
[01:22.38]
[01:33.34]Oh darling When you're near me
[01:38.66]And you tenderly call my name
[01:43.64]I know that, My emotions
[01:48.70]Are something I just cant tame
[01:53.61]I feel the earth move under my feet
[01:58.55]I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
[02:03.50]I feel my heart start to trembling
[02:07.47]Whenever you're around
[02:15.33]
[02:32.82]I feel the earth move under my feet

[02:43.01]I feel the earth move under my feet
[02:47.93]I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
[02:53.34]I just lose control
[02:58.01]Down to my very soul
[03:02.86]I get hot and cold all over all over
[03:13.04]I feel the earth move under my feet
[03:17.73]I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
[03:22.58]I feel my heart start to trembling
[03:26.60]Whenever you're around
[03:38.92]
