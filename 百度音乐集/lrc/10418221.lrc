[00:05.09]Visions of johanna
[00:06.06]
[00:07.43]Bob Dylan
[00:09.04]
[00:12.73]Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
[00:22.02]We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
[00:32.42]And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
[00:41.77]Lights flicker from the opposite loft
[00:49.93]In this room the heat pipes just cough
[00:55.12]The country music station plays soft
[00:58.04]But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
[01:03.53]Just Louise and her lover so entwined
[01:13.98]And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
[01:34.86]In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
[01:43.92]And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
[01:55.21]We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
[02:00.74]Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
[02:06.98]Louise, she's all right, she's just near
[02:12.73]She's delicate and seems like the mirror
[02:17.52]But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
[02:21.44]That Johanna's not here
[02:26.66]The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
[02:35.42]Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
[02:58.48]Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
[03:06.88]He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
[03:16.24]And when bringing her name up
[03:22.24]He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
[03:29.37]He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
[03:39.28]Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
[03:48.06]How can I explain?
[03:53.61]Oh, it's so hard to get on
[04:00.06]And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
[04:18.59]Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
[04:29.15]Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
[04:40.05]But Mona Lisa must had the highway blues
[04:44.70]You can tell by the way she smiles
[04:51.16]See the primitive wallflower freeze
[04:56.55]When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
[05:01.35]Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze
[05:04.67]I can't find my knees"
[05:09.82]Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
[05:21.86]But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
[05:35.57]The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
[05:49.89]Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
[06:02.45]But like Louise always says
[06:05.53]"Ya can't look at much, can ya man?"
[06:07.55]As she, herself, prepares for him
[06:12.48]And Madonna, she still has not showed
[06:17.75]We see this empty cage now corrode
[06:22.94]Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
[06:27.94]The fiddler, he now steps to the road
[06:32.76]He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
[06:37.84]On the back of the fish truck that loads
[06:41.65]While my conscience explodes
[06:48.05]The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
[06:58.09]And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
