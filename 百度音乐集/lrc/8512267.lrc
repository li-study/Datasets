[00:14.56]I don't need empty love words coming from somebody
[00:20.81]That'll never love me like you do
[00:27.32]I don't need to feel a warm touch from somebody else cause
[00:33.95]No other touch could be this true
[00:40.69]They can't reach me cause I'm tied to
[00:46.94]
[00:47.40]One woman, you, for me
[00:51.55]I know that you're all I'll ever need
[00:54.96]Forever beside you, spending my life loving one woman
[01:06.17]
[01:10.18]Well everything about you inside and out is perfect
[01:16.50]Over the edge I always fall
[01:23.54]Every time I see you the way I feel reminds me
[01:29.92]The world I knew seems so small
[01:36.61]Cause now with you I have it all
[01:42.99]
[01:43.31]One woman, you, for me
[01:46.30]I know that you're all I'll ever need
[01:49.50]Forever beside you, spending my life loving one woman
[02:00.51]
[02:02.44]Well back when I was selfish
[02:05.68]I thought I needed more
[02:08.88]But that road led me nowhere
[02:12.19]And I closed that door
[02:15.56]And now I love for
[02:19.04]
[02:19.53]One woman, you, for me
[02:22.80]I know that you're all I'll ever need
[02:26.40]Forever beside you, spending my life loving
[02:32.19]One woman, you for me
[02:36.08]I know that you're all I need
[02:39.47]Forever beside you, spending my life loving
[02:45.10]One woman, loving one woman
