[00:13.34]If you hear a voice in the middle of the night
[00:20.94]Sayin' it'll be alright
[00:24.85]It will be me
[00:26.89]
[00:28.09]If you feel a hand guiding you along
[00:31.15]When the path seems wrong
[00:37.88]It will be me
[00:39.72]
[00:40.96]There is no mountain that I can't climb
[00:46.98]For you I'd swim through the rivers of time
[00:53.70]As you go your way and I go mine
[01:00.27]A light will shine
[01:03.59]And it will be me
[01:08.92]
[01:13.49]If there is a key that goes to your heart
[01:19.96]A special part
[01:23.45]It will be me
[01:25.43]
[01:26.57]If you need a friend
[01:29.71]Call out to the wind
[01:32.95]To hold you again
[01:36.21]It will be me
[01:38.39]
[01:39.45]Oh how the world seems so unfair
[01:45.56]Creating a love that can not be shared
[01:52.35]As you go your way and I go mine
[01:58.82]A light will shine
[02:01.83]And it will be me
[02:10.68]
[02:11.72]Past the ever after there's a place for two
[02:22.50]In your tears of laughter
[02:29.11]I'll be there for you
[02:34.90]
[02:37.71]In the sun and the moon
[02:40.81]In the land and the sea
[02:43.87]Look all around you
[02:47.43]It will be me
[02:50.51]There is no mountain that I can't climb
[02:57.38]For you I'd swim through the rivers of time
[03:03.77]As you go your way and I go mine
[03:10.37]A light will shine
[03:13.30]And it will be me
[03:21.94]It will be me
[03:26.44]It will be me...
