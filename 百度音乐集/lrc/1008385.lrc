[00:20.43]What's wrong with the world, mama?
[00:22.36]People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
[00:24.92]I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
[00:27.67]Only attracted to things that'll bring the trauma
[00:30.09]Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
[00:32.50]But we still got terrorists here livin'
[00:34.93]In the U.S.A., the big C.I.A.
[00:37.64]The bloods and the crips and the K.K.K.
[00:40.28]But, if you only have love for your own race
[00:42.70]Then you only leave space to discriminate
[00:45.12]And to discriminate only generates hate
[00:47.68]And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
[00:50.99]Badness is what you demonstrate
[00:52.73]And that's exactly how anger works and operates
[00:55.34]Man you gotta have love just to set it straight
[00:57.69]Take control of your mind and meditate
[01:00.08]Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
[01:02.32]People killin', people dyin'
[01:04.83]Children hurt and hear them cryin'?
[01:06.94]Can you practice what you preach?
[01:09.47]And would you turn the other cheek
[01:11.99]Father, Father, Father help us
[01:14.59]Send us some guidance from above
[01:17.18]'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
[01:20.52]Where is the love?
[01:22.03](Love)
[01:23.28]Where is the love?
[01:24.18](The love)
[01:25.43]Where is the love?
[01:26.55](The love)
[01:27.95]Where is the love?
[01:30.04]The love, the love
[01:31.93]It just ain't the same, always unchanged
[01:34.74]New days are strange, is the world insane
[01:36.85]If love and peace are so strong
[01:38.72]Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
[01:40.72]Nations droppin' bombs
[01:42.31]Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
[01:44.47]With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
[01:47.23]So, ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?
[01:49.51]So, I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
[01:52.91]In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin'
[01:54.99]Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
[01:57.33]Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
[01:59.83]A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
[02:02.35]The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
[02:05.06]If you never know truth then you never know love
[02:07.52]Where's the love, y'all, come on
[02:09.20](I don't know)
[02:10.22]Where's the truth, y'all, come on
[02:11.34](I don't know)
[02:13.23]Where's the love, y'all
[02:13.85]People killin', people dyin'
[02:15.71]Children hurt and hear them cryin'
[02:18.30]Can you practice what you preach?
[02:20.81]And would you turn the other cheek
[02:23.37]Father, Father, Father help us
[02:25.96]Send us some guidance from above
[02:28.40]'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
[02:31.80]Where is the love?
[02:33.26](Love)
[02:34.35]Where is the love?
[02:35.63](The love)

[02:51.49]The love, the love
[03:04.38]I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
[03:06.32]As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
[03:08.83]Most of us only care about money makin'
[03:11.27]Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
[03:13.85]Wrong information always shown by the media
[03:16.76]Negative images is the main criteria
[03:19.02]Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
[03:21.54]Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
[03:24.14]Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
[03:27.15]Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
[03:29.66]Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
[03:32.26]Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity
[03:34.92]That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
[03:38.06]That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
[03:40.20]There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
[03:42.74]Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found
[03:45.38]And ask yourself
[03:46.37]Where is the love?
[03:48.22]Where is the love?
[03:50.65]Where is the love?
