[00:27.78]My heart just won't let go
[00:31.63]Day after day I'm still holdin' on
[00:34.95]Even though you're gone
[00:37.30]
[00:37.56]Ti amo, wasn't I good to you?
[00:43.32]I did all that I could do

[01:38.68]Oh, I guess it was there in your eyes
[01:43.23]Guess it was there in your sighs
[01:47.13]Guess it was there in your lies
[01:50.72]I was blind then, couldn't face the end
