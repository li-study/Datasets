[00:00.77]Cave In
[00:02.93]Owl City
[00:04.91]
[00:14.73]Please take a long hard look through your text book
[00:18.31]'Cause I'm history
[00:21.91]When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone
[00:25.90]'Cause I've been dying to leave
[00:28.81]Yeah, I'll ride the range and hide all my loose change
[00:32.71]In my bedroom
[00:36.19]'Cause riding a dirtbike down a turnpike
[00:40.13]Always takes it's toll on me
[00:45.12]
[00:56.40]I've had just about enough
[00:59.35]Of quote, "diamonds in the rough"
[01:01.85]Because my backbone is paper thin
[01:05.39]Get me out of this cavern
[01:07.63]Or I'll cave in
[01:09.87]
[01:12.12]If the bombs go off
[01:14.20]The sun will still be shining
[01:17.53]Because we've heard it said that every mushroom cloud
[01:21.17]Has a silver lining
[01:23.10](Though I'm always undermining too deep to know)
[01:25.94]Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
[01:29.49]'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen
[01:33.10]The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
[01:36.80]Mixed with stale gasoline
[01:39.65]I'll soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground
[01:43.92]I'll get ten minutes give-or-take
[01:46.97]'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
[01:51.11]When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
[01:55.11]
[02:05.89]Get me out of this cavern
[02:08.06]Or I'll cave in
[02:12.39]
[02:20.04]Get me out of this cavern
[02:21.77]Or I'll cave in
[02:23.75]
[02:36.91]I'll keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in
[02:43.57]'Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps
[02:47.35]It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe
[02:51.77]Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track
[02:57.53]And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
[03:01.40]Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back
[03:06.37]
[03:11.32]I won't even look back
[03:14.09]
