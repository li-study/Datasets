[00:22.01]I feel like I'm stoned
[00:24.82]I wanna be alone, just for a while unknown
[00:30.33]weeks on the road a long way from home,
[00:35.34]just shut of the phone
[00:38.84]and you say I'll heal you
[00:43.65]I'll always be yours
[00:49.06]and you say I'll kill you
[00:53.17]if I do something wrong, yeah, yeah
[01:00.78]Still feels like the first time
[01:05.00]to stand here by your side
[01:09.00]together regardless
[01:14.23]we'll walk through the darkness
[01:18.62]still feels like the first day of my life
[01:32.62]Remember the times
[01:35.13]together we swore to never give up this life
[01:41.73]still hanging on
[01:43.34]still going strong, here I belong
[01:49.07]and maybe I'm crazy
[01:53.47]but I just can't slow down
[01:58.57]Yeah maybe I'm crazy
[02:02.98]but at least I'm still around, yeah, yeah
