[00:05.14]Don't You Want Me
[00:08.95]
[00:21.20]You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
[00:26.00]When I met you
[00:29.55]I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
[00:33.98]Turned you into someone new
[00:37.76]Now five years later on you're got the world at your feet
[00:41.82]Success has been so easy for you
[00:45.68]But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
[00:49.84]And I can put you back down too
[00:52.36]
[00:54.41]Don't, don't you want me
[00:58.01]You know I can't believe it
[00:59.72]when you say that you won't see me
[01:01.99]Don't, don't you want me
[01:06.10]You know I don't believe you
[01:07.83]when you say that you don't needme
[01:10.34]It's much too late to find,
[01:12.13]you think you've changed your mind
[01:14.30]You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
[01:18.05]
[01:18.53]Don't you want me baby
[01:23.00]Don't you want me, oh
[01:26.57]Don't you want me baby
[01:31.14]Don't you want me, oh
[01:34.03]
[01:34.87]I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
[01:39.88]That much is true
[01:42.96]But even I knew I'd find a much better place
[01:47.53]Either with or without you
[01:51.30]The five years we have had have been such good times
[01:56.05]I still love you
[01:59.30]But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
[02:03.58]I guess it's just what I must do
[02:06.15]
[02:07.76]Don't, don't you want me
[02:11.63]You know I can't believe it
[02:13.25]when I hear that you won't see me
[02:15.65]Don't, don't you want me
[02:19.69]You know I don't believe you
[02:21.41]when you say that you don't needme
[02:23.84]It's much too late to find,
[02:25.75]you think you've changed your mind
[02:27.75]You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
[02:31.57]
[02:32.38]Don't you want me baby
[02:36.50]Don't you want me, oh
[02:40.20]Don't you want me baby
[02:44.67]Don't you want me, oh
[02:47.19]
[03:04.79]Don't you want me baby
[03:09.24]Don't you want me, oh
[03:12.84]Don't you want me baby
[03:17.51]Don't you want me, oh
