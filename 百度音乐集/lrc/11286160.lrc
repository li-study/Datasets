[00:15.86]Yesterday I got lost in the circus
[00:22.79]Felling like such a mess
[00:30.70]Now I'm down I'm just hanging on the corner
[00:37.61]I can't help but reminisce
[00:45.43]When you're gone all the colors fade
[00:52.65]When you're gone no New Year's Day parade
[00:57.56]You're gone
[01:05.27]Colors seem to fade
[01:16.16]Your mama called she said that you're down stairs crying
[01:22.18]Feeling like such a mess
[01:29.76]Yeah I hear you you're in the background bawling
[01:36.80]What happened to your sweet summertime dress
[01:45.10]I know we all, we all got our faults
[01:52.40]We get locked in our vaults and we stay
[01:55.75]But when you're gone all the colors fade
[02:07.14]When you're gone no New Year's Day parade
[02:15.54]You're gone
[02:19.93]Colors seem to fade
[02:27.80]Colors seem to fade
[02:33.66]Yeah
