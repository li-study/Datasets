[00:42.76]Train roll on, on down the line,
[00:52.02]Please take me far, away
[01:01.56]Now I feel the wind blow outside my door,
[01:11.42]Means I'm leaving my woman at home.
[01:21.64]Tuesday's gone with the wind.
[01:31.18]Well my baby's gone with the wind.
[01:41.15]
[02:00.84]And I don't know oh where I'm going.
[02:10.81]I just want to be left alone.
[02:20.30]Well, when this train ends I'll try again,
[02:31.06]But I'm leaving my woman at home
