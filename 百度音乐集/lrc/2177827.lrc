[00:00.00]Imagine
[00:06.31]John Lennon
[00:11.16]
[00:14.23]Imagine there's no heaven
[00:19.13]It's easy if you try
[00:24.79]No hell below us
[00:31.44]Above us only sky
[00:37.67]Imagine all the people
[00:43.55]Living for today
[00:50.44]
[00:52.32]Imagine there's no countries
[00:57.72]It isn't hard to do
[01:02.79]Nothing to kill or die for
[01:09.87]And no religion too
[01:15.28]Imagine all the people
[01:21.89]Living life in peace
[01:27.48]
[01:29.97]You may say I'm a dreamer
[01:36.21]But I'm not the only one
[01:40.84]I hope someday you'll join us
[01:47.80]And the world will be as one
[01:52.55]
[01:55.77]Imagine no possessions
[02:00.14]I wonder if you can
[02:06.81]No need for greed or hunger
[02:12.55]A brotherhood of man
[02:17.98]Imagine all the people
[02:25.10]Sharing all the world
[02:33.60]You may say I'm a dreamer
[02:31.52]
[02:38.87]But I'm not the only one
[02:43.90]I hope someday you'll join us
[02:50.78]And the world will live as one
[02:58.20]
