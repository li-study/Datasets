[00:18.72]Back when I was young
[00:20.54]Couldn't wait to grow up
[00:22.71]Get away and get out on my own
[00:27.05]And looking back now
[00:29.22]Ain't it funny how
[00:31.28]I've been trying to get back home, yeah
[00:44.14]When my low self esteem
[00:46.38]Needs a man loving me
[00:48.19]And I find me a perfect catch
[00:52.72]Then I see my friends
[00:54.56]Having wild weekends
[00:56.99]Then I don't wanna get quite so attached
[01:00.79]Evans Sara
[01:01.20]Just as soon as I get what I want
[01:04.37]I get unsatisfied
[01:10.36]Good is good but could be better
[01:14.10]I keep looking, I keep looking for
[01:18.98]I keep looking for something more
[01:22.85]I always wonder what's on the other side
[01:29.20]Of the number two door
[01:31.41]I keep looking
[01:33.52]Looking for something more
[01:43.63]Well, the straight haired girls
[01:45.96]They all want curls
[01:47.81]And the brunettes wanna be blonde
[01:52.11]It's your typical thing
[01:54.08]You got ying you want yang
[01:56.40]It just goes on and on
[02:00.55]They say, hey, it's only human
[02:02.88]To never be satisfied
[02:09.34]Then I guessed the only human that next one
[02:13.61]Oh, I keep looking
[02:16.97]I keep looking for
[02:18.87]I keep looking for something more
[02:22.55]I always wonder what's on the other side
[02:28.17]Of the number two door
[02:31.46]Yeah, I keep looking
[02:32.67]Looking for something more
[02:51.08]Just as soon as I get what I want
[02:54.06]I get unsatisfied
[02:59.55]Hey, good is good but could be better
[03:04.09]I keep looking
[03:06.22]I keep looking for
[03:09.02]I keep looking for something more
