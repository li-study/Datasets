[00:04]In an open room that echoes well, this is where I can tell you everything.
[00:26]This is where I meet my muse, and it feeds me.
[00:37]This is how I buy the sun, and it feeds me.
[00:48]This is why I burn this candle, I light it so that I can handle this.
[01:04]You're so still, you're so safe,
[01:10]appear severe,
[01:12]you are so nonchalant.
[01:15]I'm so still,
[01:19]I'm so safe,
[01:20]appear severe
[01:22]I am not.
[01:37]This is where I meet my muse, and it feeds me.
[01:47]This is how I buy the sun, and it feeds me.
[01:58]I told David I won't die, and this is how I watch the sky,
[02:03]This is why I burn this candle, I light it so that I can handle this.
[02:19]You're so still,
[02:22]you save face.
[02:25]Try to erase all you feel inside.
[02:29]Stand still,
[02:33]I save face
[02:34]I misplace all the feelings I can't hide.
[02:40]Of all the rooms I've loved before it's you I love inside this room.
[02:50]They tes tme can I train my evil eye to see like they do -
[02:56]sometimes, sometimes, sometimes.
[03:00]Of all the rooms I've loved before
[03:06]it's you I love.
[03:13]This is how I meet my muse.
