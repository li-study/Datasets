[01:36.63]Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
[01:41.91]No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
[01:47.15]Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
[01:52.57]Victim of what said should be
[01:55.34]Aservant `til I fall
[01:57.50]
[01:57.95]Soldier boy, made of clay
[02:00.58]Now an empty shell
[02:02.61]Twenty one, only son
[02:05.24]But he served us well
[02:07.35]Bred to kill, not to care
[02:10.04]Just do as we say
[02:12.08]Finished here, Greeting Death

[02:39.88]You will die when I say, you must die
[02:43.43]Back to the front
[02:44.86]You coward , you servant, you blindman
[02:50.02]
[02:50.25]Barking of machinegun fire, does nothing to me now
[02:55.65]Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
[03:01.01]More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends
[03:06.27]Bodies fill the fields I see
[03:08.94]The slaughter never ends

[05:40.20][04:22.89]Hell, Hell is here
[04:26.59]
[05:44.19]I was born for dying
[05:50.15]
[06:00.00]Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
[06:05.42]Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
[06:10.79]Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
[06:16.23]Left to die with only friend
[06:19.02]Alone I clench my gun
[06:21.00]
