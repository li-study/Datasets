[00:00.09]Jimmy Eat World - Littlething
[00:01.14]
[00:25.08]It's how I've often felt
[00:28.21]When I find myself on nights like these,
[00:35.07]Like Christmas Eve
[00:38.12]From the empty office window
[00:41.69]To the street outside
[00:44.76]It's everything not to call
[00:48.35]And find out why
[00:50.39]
[01:30.20]On the cab ride you said nothing
[01:33.47]Just hair all in your face
[01:36.75]I was scared to name it
[01:40.02]And nothing changed
[01:42.88]So, I walked until I just couldn't
[01:46.37]Too late I understood
[01:49.34]It was always half invented
[01:52.73]But the other half was good
[01:54.98]
[03:26.34][03:00.17][01:55.69][00:51.03]It's just a little thing
[03:29.27][03:03.45][01:58.59][00:53.68]Buried in the other things
[03:32.45][03:06.73][02:01.62][00:56.94]Burning away, from inside
[03:35.66][03:09.89][02:04.82][01:00.17]Would you stay with me tonight?
[03:39.13][03:12.93][02:08.09][01:03.83]There's a quiet dream
[02:11.46][01:06.68]I'm not supposed to think
[03:45.52][03:19.70][02:14.73][01:10.03]Eating away at my mind
[02:17.92][01:13.33]Could you be with me tonight?
[03:54.01][03:24.90][02:20.86][01:16.65]
[03:42.12][03:16.24]I know I shouldn't think
[03:22.92]Would you stay with me tonight?
[03:49.04]Stay with me tonight
[03:56.03]
