[00:12.94]Embrace Me
[00:16.41]Lullacry
[00:16.74]Be My God
[00:17.12]
[00:35.99]Give me your teardrops
[00:39.44]And say that you're mine
[00:42.82]See how wicked are the restless ones in grace
[00:48.98]It's our twisted love
[00:52.66]that turns me on
[00:55.82]I never wanted to go where the memories lie
[01:00.73]In the endless night
[01:18.71]I shall but my arms
[01:22.00]around this fear
[01:25.08]Don't be afraid now
[01:27.16]'cos all the things we have
[01:30.37]are stronger than life's path
[01:35.03]I never wanted to go where the memories lie
[01:43.98]It's still better to be alive
[01:50.47]than to be dead in heaven
[01:56.93]Your touch is so bitter sweet
[02:03.40]I want you to embrace me
[02:07.75]
[02:08.89]OH YEAH
[02:11.05]Embrace me!
[02:16.11]
[02:39.87]I never wanted to go where the memories lie
[02:52.08]It's still better to be alive
[02:58.61]than to be dead in heaven
[03:05.02]Your touch is so bitter sweet
[03:11.57]I want you
[03:14.37]you to embrace me
[03:18.31]
