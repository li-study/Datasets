[00:24.27]each day through my window
[00:26.91]i watch him as she passes by.
[00:35.30]i say to myself, "what an incredible guy."
[00:46.96]To have a girl like her
[00:51.30]must surely be a dream come true.
[00:57.49]out of  all the fellas in the world,
[01:02.26]she belongs to only you.
[01:07.67]but it was just my imagination
[01:14.21]runnin' away with me.
[01:18.32]it was just my imagination
[01:23.87]runnin' away with me.
[01:29.32]
[01:31.81]soon we'll be married
[01:35.32]and raise a family.
[01:41.58]a cozy little home out in the country
[01:46.19]with two children, maybe three
[01:51.19]
[01:51.55]i tell you, i can visualize it all.
[02:03.51]this couldn't be a dream
[02:06.14]how real it all seems.
[02:12.02]
[02:13.72]but it was just my imagination, once again
[02:20.13]runnin' away with me.
[02:24.74]tell you it was just my imagination
[02:29.76]runnin' away with me.
[02:36.17]
[02:40.47]every night on my knees i pray:
[02:45.54]dear lord, hear my plea.
[02:50.72]don't ever let another take his love from me
[02:55.41]or i will surely, surely die.
[02:58.25]
[03:00.56]her love is heavenly.
[03:04.17]when her arms enfold me
[03:07.32]i hear a tender rhapsody.
[03:11.33]but in reality
[03:14.92]she doesn't even know me.
[03:18.08](ohh~........)just my imagination
[03:23.36]runnin' away with me.
[03:28.78]just my imagination
[03:32.96]runnin' away with me.
[03:38.99]
[03:39.78]just my imagination
[03:42.12](just my imagination)
[03:45.44]runnin' away with me.
[03:50.79]just my imagination
[03:54.90]running away with me.
[04:01.04]
[04:12.78]just my imagination
[04:16.19]runnin' away with me . . .
