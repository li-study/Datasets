[00:12.14]I would have been in doubt when this started out
[00:14.36]That everything would turn out this way
[00:17.33]First it was a phone call then it was another
[00:19.88]from a mother who was ready to play
[00:22.82]She said things that no one ever told me before
[00:28.14]But how could I have known that she wanted to settle the score?
[00:33.15]
[00:33.73]Then a man came in
[00:35.37]I can finally see it and it looks like you're having fun
[00:39.12]When I get back
[00:40.79]You're gonna be bleeding so I think son, you'd better run
[00:44.92]Now I think
[00:46.34]I should be leaving 'cause it looks like I've had enough
[00:50.47]She was a deceiver
[00:51.80]But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
[00:56.79]
[00:58.80](She told me she was in love
[01:03.92]She told me she was in love)
[01:06.20]
[01:07.38]I knew I could fix it in just another minute
[01:09.65]But I guess it was a minute too late
[01:12.52]I knew he was coming and I should have been running
[01:15.22]If he'd caught me I would never escape
[01:18.03]Now I know it never should have been a surprise
[01:23.48]But how could I have known that she was only telling me lies
[01:28.03]
[01:28.96]'Cause a man came in
[01:30.60]I thought you were leaving but I see you're still having fun
[01:34.67]Now I'm back
[01:36.11]And you're gonna be bleeding so I think son, you'd better run
[01:40.04]Now I see
[01:41.50]I should be leaving 'cause it looks like I've done enough
[01:45.70]She was a deceiver
[01:47.01]But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
[01:52.37]
[01:53.40]Don't blame me,
[01:56.10]It's not my fault,
[01:58.55]Don't blame me,
[02:00.77]I'm not the one.
[02:03.00]
[02:23.90]'Cause a man came in,
[02:25.67]I thought you were leaving but I see you're still having fun
[02:29.83]Now I'm back
[02:31.20]You're gonna be bleeding so I think son, you'd better run
[02:35.38]Now I see
[02:36.68]I should be leaving cause it looks like I've done enough
[02:40.83]She was a deceiver
[02:42.11]But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
[02:46.67]
[02:50.49]She told me she was in love
[02:53.18]
