[00:06.72]I've come to hate my body
[00:13.78]All that it requires in this world
[00:25.96]Candy says
[00:31.87]I'd like to know completely
[00:38.37]what others so discretely talk about
[00:45.65]
[00:45.77]I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
[00:58.63]Over my shoulder
[01:01.93]I'm gonna watch them pass me by
[01:08.66]Maybe when I'm older
[01:13.49]What do you think I'd see
[01:19.09]If I could walk away from me

[01:27.34]Candy says
[01:34.60]I hate the quiet places

[02:17.07]I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
[02:24.78]over my shoulder
[02:28.11]And I'm gonna watch them pass me by
[02:35.97]Maybe when I'm older
[02:40.54]What do you think I'd see
[02:46.13]If I could walk away from me
