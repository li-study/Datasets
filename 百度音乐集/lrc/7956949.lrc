[00:01.58]I'm on My Way
[00:08.87]I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
[00:16.90]I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
[00:24.91]I'm on my way to what I want from this world
[00:29.14]And years from now you'll make it to the next world
[00:33.04]And everything that you receive up yonder
[00:37.55]Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
[00:41.68]I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
[00:48.99]I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
[00:57.15]I took the road that brought me to your home town
[01:01.25]I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
[01:05.34]I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
[01:09.31]I climbed the stair that led me to your front door
[01:13.38]And now that I don't want for anthing
[01:21.48]I'd have Al Joison sing "I'm sitting on top of the world"
[01:29.42]I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
[01:37.73]I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
[01:45.34]To keep my feet from jumping from the ground dear
[01:49.65]To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth dear
[01:53.64]To keep the past, the past and not the present
[01:57.59]To try and learn when you teach me a lesson
[02:01.78]And now that I don't want for anything
[02:09.80]I'd have Al Joison sing "I'm sitting on top of the world".
[02:19.99]I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
[02:28.16]I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
[02:36.01]I'm on my way to what I want from this world
[02:40.02]And years from now you'll make it to the next world
[02:44.22]And everything that you receive up yonder
[02:48.42]Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
[02:52.64]I'm on my way to what I want from this world
[02:56.21]And years from now you'll make it to the next world
[03:00.14]And everything that you receive up yonder
[03:04.21]Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
[03:10.36]I want my way
[03:14.34]I want my way
[03:18.26]I want my way
[03:22.35]....
