[00:00.00]Snow Patrol
[00:10.00]Eyes open
[00:20.00]The Finish Line
[00:36.52]The earth is warm next to my ear
[00:45.27]Insects noise is all that I hear
[00:53.52]A magic trick makes the world disappear
[01:01.40]The skies are dark, they\'re dark but they\'re clear
[01:09.46]A distant motorcade and suddenly there\'s joy
[01:17.88]The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
[01:26.40]It\'s like the finish line where everything just ends
[01:34.87]The crack of radios seems close enough to touch
[01:44.68]Cold water, cleaning my wounds
[01:53.04]A side parade, with a single balloon
[02:01.55]I\'m done with this, I\'m coming to town(?)
[02:10.25]Blue as seas, running to them
[02:17.48]I feel like I am watching everything from space
[02:25.85]And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
[02:34.36]I think the finish line\'s a good place we could start
[02:43.00]Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
[03:28.00] - End -
