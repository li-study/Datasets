[00:17.80]When the road gets dark
[00:24.41]And you can no longer see
[00:30.91]Let my love throw a spark
[00:36.58]And have a little faith in me
[00:41.95]
[00:42.44]When the tears you cry
[00:48.73]Are all you can't believe
[00:54.61]Just give these loving arms a try, baby
[01:00.06]And have a little faith, faith in me
[01:05.58]Have a little faith in me
[01:10.93]Have a little faith in me
[01:17.11]Have a little faith in me
[01:23.06]Have a little faith, faith in me
[01:28.80]
[01:30.28]And when your secret heart
[01:36.56]Cannot speak so easily
[01:42.15]Come here baby
[01:44.33]From a whisper start
[01:48.20]To have a little faith in me
[01:53.40]
[01:54.10]And when your back's against the wall
[02:00.03]Just turn around and you will see
[02:06.03]I will catch your, I will catch your fall
[02:11.75]Just have a little faith, faith in me
[02:17.26]Have a little faith in me
[02:22.94]Have a little faith in me
[02:28.95]Have a little faith in me
[02:34.68]Have a little faith, faith in me
[02:40.67]
[02:42.20]Well, I've been loving you for such a long long time
[02:46.78]Expecting nothing in return
[02:49.21]Just for you to have a little faith in me
[02:53.59]You see time, time is our friend
[02:56.91]'Cause for us there is no end
[02:59.98]And all you gotta do is have a little faith in me
[03:04.90]I will hold you up, I will hold you up
[03:12.16]And your love gives me strength enough to
[03:17.23]Have a little faith in me
[03:27.09]Have a little faith in me
[03:32.01]
