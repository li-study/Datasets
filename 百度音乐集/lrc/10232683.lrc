[00:02.29]Stereophonics - Maybe Tomorrow
[00:07.07]
[00:24.52]I've been down and
[00:25.53]I'm wondering why
[00:27.08]These little black clouds
[00:28.29]Keep walking around
[00:29.69]With me
[00:32.88]With me
[00:35.97]It wastes time
[00:37.23]And I'd rather be high
[00:38.72]Think I'll walk me outside
[00:40.03]And buy a rainbow smile
[00:41.46]But be free
[00:44.24]They're all free
[00:48.96]So maybe tomorrow
[00:53.03]I'll find my way home
[01:00.78]So maybe tomorrow
[01:04.95]I'll find my way home
[01:12.00]I look around at a beautiful life
[01:14.29]Been the upperside of down
[01:15.89]Been the inside of out
[01:17.55]But we breathe
[01:20.21]We breathe
[01:23.66]I wanna breeze and an open mind
[01:25.94]I wanna swim in the ocean
[01:27.67]Wanna take my time for me
[01:31.87]All me
[01:36.45]So maybe tomorrow
[01:40.52]I'll find my way home
[01:48.25]So maybe tomorrow
[01:52.37]I'll find my way home
[02:47.64]So maybe tomorrow
[02:51.69]I'll find my way home
[02:59.43]So maybe tomorrow
[03:03.42]I'll find my way home
[03:11.24]So maybe tomorrow
[03:15.51]I'll find my way home
[03:23.14]So maybe tomorrow
[03:27.32]I'll find my way home
