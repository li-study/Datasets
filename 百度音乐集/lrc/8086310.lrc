[00:15.64]To my love yao
[00:28.94]
[00:34.59]Bart: I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. You can't prove anything.
[00:46.53]Bart: Yo! Hey, what's happening, dude?
[00:58.02]I'm the guy with the rep for being rude.
[01:00.54]Terrorizing people wherever I go,
[01:02.83]It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow.
[01:04.96]
[01:05.16]Fixin' test scores to get the best scores.
[01:07.39]Droppin' banana peels all over the floor.
[01:09.67]I'm the kid that made delinquency an art;
[01:11.90]Last name Simpson, first name Bart.
[01:14.01]
[01:14.81]I'm here today to introduce the next phase,
[01:16.66]The next step in the big Bart craze.
[01:18.99]I've got a dance real easy to do;
[01:21.18]I learned it with no rhythm, and so can you.
[01:23.54]
[01:24.31]So move your body if you've got the notion,
[01:25.98]Front to back in a rock-like motion.
[01:28.22]Now that you've got it, if you think you can,
[01:30.55]Do it to the music -- that's the Bartman.
[01:32.37]
[01:33.54]Back: Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman.
[01:34.89]Bart: Whoa!
[01:36.19]Back: Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man.
[01:36.52]Bart: Shake it out, man!
[01:38.19]Back: Front to the back, to the side if you can, can.
[01:39.91]Bart: Bartman!

[01:44.60]Back: Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man.
[01:46.77]Bart: Whoa, mama!
[01:48.46]Back: Front to the back, to the side if you can, can.
[01:50.13]Bart: Whoa.

[01:52.04]
[01:52.43]Bart: It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks,
[01:53.63]I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep.
[01:55.97]Homer was yellin',
[01:58.29]Homer: BART!
[01:59.05]Bart: Mom was too,
[01:59.58]Because I put mothballs in the beef stew.
[02:00.69]
[02:01.00]Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom,
[02:02.96]Sitting by myself, confined to my room.
[02:05.26]When all else fails, nothin' else left to do,
[02:07.53]I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove.
[02:09.86]Back: Move your body, if you've got the notion.
[02:12.36]Bart: Whoa, I'm feelin' the groove now, baby!
[02:12.83]Back: Front to back in a rock-like motion.
[02:14.73]Bart: Bring it back, whoa!

[03:33.33]Now I'm in the house, feeling good to be home,
[03:35.49]Till Lisa starts blowing that damn saxophone.
[03:37.87]And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away,
[03:40.07]But still I'm feeling good, so that's okay.
[03:42.20]
[03:42.75]I'm up in my room, just a singin' a song,
[03:44.62]Listen to the kick drum, kickin' along.
