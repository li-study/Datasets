[02:40.83][02:23.42][02:08.76][00:15.00]Music
[00:19.01]I've got you under my skin
[00:27.16]I've got you deep in the heart of me
[00:35.00]So deep in my heart
[00:38.00]that you're really a part of me
[00:42.20]I've got you under my skin
[00:50.61]I've tried so not to give in
[00:57.20]I've said to myself this affair never gonna swing so well
[01:06.02]So why should I try to resist
[01:08.51]when baby will I know damn well
[02:25.87][01:13.17]I've got you under my skin
[01:21.00]I'd sacrifice anything come what might
[01:24.17]For the sake of having you near
[01:27.89]In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
[01:31.07]And repeats, repeats in my ear
[01:36.37]Don't you know little fool you'll never win
[01:42.61]Why not use your mentality
[01:46.69]come on step up to reality
[01:51.03]But each time I do, just the thought of you
[01:54.40]Makes me stop before I begin
[02:00.15]'Cause I've got you under my skin
[02:30.47][02:14.29]Baby I've got you under my skin
[02:40.57]under my skin
[02:51.37]End
