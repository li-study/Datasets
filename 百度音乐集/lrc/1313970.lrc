[00:28.89]Monday night I feel so low
[00:32.49]Count the hours they go so slow
[00:36.49]I know the sound of your voice
[00:39.83]Can save my soul
[00:44.35]City lights, streets of gold
[00:48.20]Look out my window to the world below
[00:52.39]Moves so fast and it feels so cold
[00:55.65]And I`m all alone (And I`m all alone)
[00:59.56]Don`t let me die
[01:01.52]I`m losing my mind
[01:04.41]Baby just give me a sign 
[01:07.25]And now that you`re gone
[01:10.94]I just wanna be with you
[01:14.99]And I can`t go on
[01:18.66]I wanna be with you
[01:23.14]Wanna be with you
[01:25.41]
[01:35.70]I can`t sleep and I`m up all night
[01:39.80]Through these tears I try to smile
[01:43.57]I know the touch of your hand
[01:46.83]Can save my life
[01:50.89]Don`t let me down
[01:52.83]Come to me now
[01:55.57]I got to be with you some how
[01:58.40]And now that you`re gone
[02:02.12]I just wanna be with you
[02:06.13]And I can`t go on
[02:10.25]I wanna be with you
[02:14.26]Wanna be with you
[02:16.71]
[02:35.16]I got to be with you some how
[02:37.85]And now that you`re gone
[02:42.66]Who am I with-out you now
[02:46.01]I can`t go on
[02:49.38]I just wanna be with you
[02:53.54]And now that you`re gone
[02:57.28]I just wanna be with you
[03:01.23]And I can`t go on
[03:05.41]I wanna be with you
[03:08.23]Wanna be with you
