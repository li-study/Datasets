[00:00.00]JC Chasez - Come To Me
[00:23.91]
[00:23.92]Traveling through galaxies on telepathic roads
[00:27.86]Singing in the distance, clouds of breath out in the cold
[00:31.90]All of my desires waiting for someone to hold
[00:35.37]So come to me
[00:37.34]So come to me, ooh
[00:56.00]
[00:56.02]Lying here pretending that you're closer than you are
[00:59.85]Swear I heard you whispering "would someone break my fall?"
[01:03.87]Memories of kisses fill my dreams until the dawn
[01:07.52]So come to me
[01:09.37]So come to me
[01:10.00]
[01:10.96]The nights when you don't call
[01:14.58]My life is a catastrophe
[01:18.77]I need to feel you close to me
[01:22.83]I'm waiting out the storm
[01:27.00]
[01:27.64]Cause when I'm all alone
[01:31.15]I imagine lying face-to-face
[01:35.52]Inhaling every breath you take
[01:39.38]I'm waiting out the storm
[01:43.54]I'm waiting out the storm
[02:00.00]
[02:00.56]Conversation hotter than a fireman engulfed
[02:04.65]Sweeping through my body causing temperatures to smoke
[02:08.67]Every second passing makes it hard for me to cope
[02:12.29]So come to me
[02:14.09]So come to me
[02:16.00]
[02:16.78]Walking with my fingers and I'm creeping down real slow
[02:20.66]Reaching for the places that no one could ever go
[02:24.64]Pushing me to ecstasy, you touch my very soul
[02:28.12]So come to me
[02:30.11]So come to me, yea
[03:07.00]
[03:07.86]Thinking of you
[03:11.58]What can I do
[03:15.60]I'm thinking of you
[03:33.00]
[03:33.84]Cause when I'm all alone
[03:39.46]I lie awake and masturbate
[03:43.58]I love to hear the sounds you make
[03:47.76]Baby here I come
[03:51.64]Baby here I come
[04:24.00]
[04:24.36]Come, come
[04:28.21]Waiting, waiting
[04:32.19]I know, I know
[04:35.71]You'll come to me
[04:37.76]You'll come to me
[05:07.00]
[05:07.84]So come to me
[05:09.77]So come to me
[05:23.00]
[05:23.68]So come to me
[05:25.77]So come to me
