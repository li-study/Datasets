[00:-0.50]Fort Minor - Back Home

[00:04.64](feat. Common and Styles Of Beyond)
[00:06.64]
[00:10.64]Back home
[00:12.17]Everybody's searching for somethin'
[00:13.79]But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
[00:15.92]Back home
[00:17.24]Ain't nobody hoping and praying
[00:19.15]'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
[00:21.33]And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
[00:24.20]Life goes black when those lights go out
[00:26.43]But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
[00:29.01]'Cause ain't a damn thing free
[00:30.52]Back home
[00:31.12]
[00:32.11]Back home / they holler "disciple" and "blackstone"
[00:34.61]Same block the freebase yo we trapped on
[00:37.24]Where our grandmothers marched / The guns clap on
[00:40.11]There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
[00:42.84]I travel the world just to come back to it
[00:45.47]The crib got a lot of soul like black music
[00:47.93]I'm attached to it
[00:49.13]In many ways this city raised me / and gave me
[00:51.73]The drama, honor, and bravery
[00:53.40]The streets seem hollow / when I go to Chicago
[00:56.12]It's cheap wine and sorrow
[00:57.27]Times is hard to swallow
[00:58.74]In search of God's tomorrow / I borrow words from the
[01:01.55]Bible / and use them for survival / gangs rival
[01:04.59]Signs painted on walls like hiero / glyphics
[01:07.68]I tell 'em that this is all tribal
[01:09.27]Used to do dirt / Shorty's goin' through the same cycle
[01:11.97]And trials like Michael / tryin' not to stay idle
[01:14.43]
[01:14.71]Back home
[01:16.16]Everybody's searching for somethin'
[01:17.72]But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
[01:19.85]Back home
[01:21.28]Ain't nobody hoping and praying
[01:23.10]'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
[01:25.10]And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
[01:28.20]Life goes black when those lights go out
[01:30.52]But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
[01:32.98]'Cause ain't a damn thing free
[01:34.48]Back home
[01:35.17]
[01:35.91]Back home it's not Compton but close
[01:37.61]The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
[01:39.88]And folks are so common
[01:41.23]It don't / really bother us much we just swallow it / uh
[01:44.42]Crack the bottle and smoke / hope tomorrow something
[01:46.90]Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
[01:49.22]But the chances of it acutally happening's kinda slim
[01:51.81]Back home / we get the good life at a glimpse
[01:54.37]In the form of a rap star, drug dealers, and pimps
[01:57.06]I'm back home
[01:57.82]
[01:58.19]I try my best to keep it together it's cold
[02:00.24]Like the Windy City streets of December
[02:02.44]I pace back and forth / looking for the courage to shine
[02:04.97]But can't lap the source / need something to nourish my mind
[02:07.72]I know we all lose quite a bit in life
[02:09.41]Only to gain some
[02:11.01]Life or the dark winding roads we came from
[02:13.37]But I move with the night / so I'm used to the shade
[02:15.69]And never lose sight / bringing truth back to the game
[02:18.16]
[02:18.54]Back home / We've got a lot of shit on our minds
[02:21.01]We're always behind on something cause there's not enough time
[02:23.64]And we're non-stop / bottom line / doing what we gotta do
[02:26.39]To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
[02:29.32]Back home there's people calling us hopeless
[02:31.95]People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
[02:34.44]But focus
[02:35.94]Focus is overrated
[02:37.30]Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
[02:40.48]Back home is Alvarado / K-Town and J-Town
[02:43.33]Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
[02:45.61]Where figures shiver / living right in the littler
[02:47.76]Where kids write bigger / right inside the LA river
[02:50.36]On the concrete / a symbol of our everyday way
[02:53.04]Its that color and concentration over heavy and grey
[02:55.98]And by the time the ink dries on this page
[02:58.39]I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay
[03:01.05]Back home
[03:02.69]Everybody's searching for somethin'
[03:04.31]But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
[03:06.51]Back home
[03:07.97]Ain't nobody hoping and praying
[03:09.78]'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
[03:11.85]And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
[03:14.98]Life goes black when those lights go out
[03:17.07]But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
[03:19.69]'Cause ain't a damn thing free
[03:21.12]Back home
