[00:08.00]Talk To Me
[00:10.00]
[00:12.25]There you are again
[00:14.18]I see you all the time
[00:16.74]We haven't really met yet,
[00:19.62]But you know, I don't mind
[00:22.72]'Cuz I think today's the day
[00:25.38]I'm gonna go right up and say to you
[00:28.23]Would it be alright
[00:30.79]If I called you up sometime?
[00:35.35]
[00:39.61]There you go again
[00:42.25]I let you get away
[00:45.26]At least I've got more time
[00:47.82]To think of what I might say (like)
[00:50.80]“Couldn't we be good” (or maybe)
[00:53.94]“Don't you think that we should find
[00:56.72]Some quiet little place where we'd make love all day?”
[01:02.20]
[01:02.96]Come and talk to me
[01:04.98]What are you waiting for
[01:07.54]'Cuz I can see you passing every day and I'm always wanting more
[01:11.10]Come and talk to me
[01:16.67]What are you gonna do
[01:19.42]'Cuz I can't seem to get the nerve to get off my own ass
[01:24.51]And come and talk to you
[01:26.27]
[01:35.74]You know I love the type
[01:38.16]You look like you've been up all night
[01:41.97]And yet somehow still look beautiful
[01:44.72]You do it all at the same time
[01:47.76]Whenever you walk by
[01:50.23]You always look me in the eyes
[01:52.98]And in that moment I know
[01:55.77]the same thing's on your mind
[01:59.34]Come and talk to me
[02:02.13]What are you waiting for
[02:04.21]'Cuz I can see you passing every day and I'm always wanting more
[02:09.59]Come and talk to me
[02:12.79]What are you gonna do
[02:15.16]'Cuz I can't seem to get the nerve to get off my own ass
[02:21.02]And come and talk to you
[02:22.65]
[02:32.55]It always seems to be that I let the good things pass by
[02:37.86]Because I let my fear stop me (but not this time)
[02:44.43]Come and talk to me
[02:46.86]What are you waiting for
[02:49.23]'Cuz I can see you passing every day and I'm always wanting more
[02:55.41]Come and talk to me
[02:57.81]What are you gonna do
[03:00.47]'Cuz I can't seem to get the nerve to get off my own ass
[03:05.47]And come and talk to you
[03:10.37]
