[00:28.83]Long ago and oh so far away
[00:39.15]I fell in love with you before the second show
[00:51.99]Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
[01:02.18]But you're not really
[01:08.48]It's just the radio
[01:15.02]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[01:20.41]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[01:25.95]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[01:31.21]I love you I really do
[01:37.69]
[02:02.97]Loneliness is a such a sad affair
[02:13.39]And I can hardly wait to be with you again
[02:25.65]What to say to make you come again
[02:36.30]Come back to me again
[02:42.09]And play your sad guitar
[02:48.53]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[02:53.81]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[02:59.36]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[03:04.62]I love you I really do
[03:12.96]Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
[03:18.22]You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
[03:23.73]Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
[03:28.88]I love you I really do
