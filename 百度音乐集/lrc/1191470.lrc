[00:14.70]Yeah you
[00:17.81]You had a dark  sexy vibe about
[00:21.62]And a strange way you turn me on
[00:25.37]The way you look said a lot about ya
[00:29.36]As if you really didn't give a-unh
[00:33.19]I told myself not to fall for you
[00:37.05]Cause I can see that you don't follow rules
[00:40.93]I should've just walked away
[00:45.01]But your eyes were telling me to stay
[01:43.51][00:49.30]Damn  why do the wild ones turn me on
[03:21.81][03:06.24][02:04.33][01:49.07][00:54.59]It's like cherry pie  you can't deny it

[03:11.50][02:09.59][01:54.14][01:00.22]That's what it feels like

[03:31.84][03:16.39][02:14.46][01:59.02][01:04.28]Breaking rules and didn't care
[03:19.35][02:17.71][02:01.87][01:07.86]That's what it feels like
[01:12.37]A real rebel kinda fella
[01:16.46]The kind that I would never trust
[01:19.74]I could read what your mind was thinking
[01:23.52]It's like you still didn't give a-hey!
[01:27.32]It's funny how those kind of guys
[01:31.50]Have a way of getting what they want
[01:35.15]And even good girls though they try
[01:38.90]It's if they just can't stay away
[02:51.39]I can be your cherry pie
[02:55.21]And you can be my cream on top
[02:59.11]I can be your cherry pie
[03:02.78]And you can be my cream on top
