[00:13.40]Guess mine is not the first
[00:16.96]heart broken
[00:20.17]My eyes are not the first
[00:23.32]to cry
[00:26.73]I\'m not the first to know
[00:30.49]There\'s just no getting over you
[00:36.85]
[00:39.65]You know I\'m just a fool
[00:42.81]who\'s willing
[00:46.22]To sit around
[00:48.57]and wait for you
[00:53.03]But, baby, can\'t you see
[00:56.18]There\'s nothing else for me to do?
[01:02.45]I\'m hopelessly devoted to you
[01:08.56]
[01:10.06]But now
[01:12.27]there\'s nowhere to hide
[01:15.38]Since you pushed my love aside
[01:18.48]I\'m out of my head
[01:22.19]Hopelessly devoted to you
[01:28.55]Hopelessly devoted to you
[01:38.42]Hopelessly devoted to you
[01:46.89]
[01:47.94]My head is saying,
[01:50.45]\"Fool, forget him.\"
[01:54.30]My heart is saying,
[01:56.51]\"Don\'t let go.
[02:00.92]Hold on till the end.\"
[02:04.67]And that\'s what I intend to do
[02:10.64]I\'m hopelessly devoted to you
[02:17.00]
[02:18.30]But now
[02:20.39]there\'s nowhere to hide
[02:23.59]Since you pushed my love aside
[02:26.75]I\'m out of my head
[02:30.41]Hopelessly devoted to you
[02:36.97]Hopelessly devoted to you
[02:46.69]Hopelessly devoted to you
