[00:01.34]Talk to me
[00:04.96]You speak with me
[00:07.75]Don’t sink before you rise, baby
[00:12.55]Don’t fade away
[00:16.43]
[00:16.64]You hesitate
[00:20.03]You seem to wait
[00:22.99]For all the time we had
[00:27.04]Feels a world away
[00:31.66]
[00:31.99]Who’s to say, we’ll be okay
[00:35.94]We will make it through the night
[00:39.87]Don’t want to wake up in this state
[00:43.71]I just want us both to smile

[00:57.45]I don’t want to see it melt away
[01:02.34]
[01:02.70]If you walk out now

[01:40.67]I locked inside my heart
[01:44.52]Where I know I won’t forget
[01:48.10]
[01:48.34]And now, who’s to say, we’ll be okay

[02:14.91]I don’t want to see it melt away
[02:20.06]
[02:20.81]If you walk out now
