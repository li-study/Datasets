[00:15.18]Come come naveed,
[00:17.88]come come naveed,
[00:46.78]
[00:49.74]Are you there, and is it comfortable?
[00:56.69]Did you want to escape, try to escape the population?
[01:06.27]The pressure is deceiving,
[01:13.48]And for you particularly should we let a young man die?
[01:19.36]
[01:21.90]Let him die if he wants to?
[01:27.30]I can't live here anymore
[01:32.29]It's hard when you reach for that floor and
[01:38.98]And there's something that tears me inside, so i can't go
[01:44.37]
[01:58.19]Brother are you there?
[02:03.32]Now tell me is it wonderful
[02:08.69]Or were you hoping to find something a little more?
[02:17.64]
[02:19.74]Climbing down the hours i need to know now
[02:24.51]Do the hands of time only rule this chapter
[02:29.65]I'll have to try once again, i'll have to try when i want to
[02:40.24]I can't live here anymore
[02:45.78]It's hard when you reach for that floor and
[02:51.35]And there's something that tears me inside, so i can't go
[03:04.70]Anymore
[03:12.32]There he's on his knees again
[03:14.34]Trying hard to understand
[03:16.82]Why naveed would let a young man die
[03:21.92]Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone
[03:27.33]And then another day has gone
