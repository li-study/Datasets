[00:24.27]You came to me with the morning light
[00:30.20]You brought the warmth to my smile
[00:36.53]You showed me love could be more than bliss
[00:41.74]And lingered with me for a while
[00:47.11]
[00:48.34]You brought me comfort when I felt lost
[00:54.19]You ask for nothing from me
[00:59.15]but somehow gods in the infinite wisdom
[01:05.20]Decided to take you from me
[01:09.89]
[01:11.40]God's little angel I love you
[01:17.11]God's little angel good night
[01:22.56]For each night as I look at the stars in the sky
[01:28.75]God's little angel shines bright
[01:33.11]
[01:34.67]God's little angel I love you
[01:40.59]God's little angel good night
[01:45.93]For each night as I look at the stars in the sky
[01:53.01]I know god's little angel shines bright
[02:01.24]
[02:09.04]I sit alone with these memories
[02:15.29]I cry just knowing you're gone
[02:20.91]Sometimes I pray you would walk through the door
[02:26.12]And take me to your brand new home
[02:31.44]
[02:32.87]If you could hear what my heart is saying
[02:38.66]Then you would know how I feel
[02:44.50]Every emotions I hold deep inside
[02:50.43]Cannot replace what was real
[02:54.45]
[02:55.53]God's little angel I love you
[03:01.18]God's little angel good night
[03:06.76]For each night as I look at the stars in the sky
[03:12.78]God's little angel shines bright
[03:18.70]
[03:19.11]God's little angel I love you
[03:25.03]God's little angel good night
[03:30.50]For each night as I look at the stars in the sky
[03:37.53]I know god's little angel shines bright
[03:45.62]shines bright
[03:51.42]shines bright
