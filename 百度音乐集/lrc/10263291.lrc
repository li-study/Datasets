[00:04.16]After long enough of being alone,
[00:10.58]Ev'ryone must face their share of loneliness.
[00:18.58]In my own time nobody knew
[00:23.71]the pain I was goin' thru,
[00:27.30]And watin' was all my heart could do.
[00:33.28]Hope was all I had until you came,
[00:38.94]Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me.
[00:47.68]You were the dawn breaking the night
[00:52.39]The promise of morning light.
[00:56.06]Filling the world surrounding me
[01:00.33]When I hold you Baby, Baby
[01:03.66]Feels like maybe things will be all right
[01:08.49]Baby, Baby
[01:10.66]Your love's made me
[01:12.07]Free as a song singin' forever
[01:15.93]Only yesterday when I was sad
[01:20.07]And I was lonely
[01:22.19]You showed me the way to leave
[01:25.77]The past and all its tears behind me
[01:29.79]Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
[01:35.26]Since I threw my sadness away
[01:41.85]Only Yesterday
[01:44.62]
[02:12.01]I have found my home here in your arms
[02:17.89]Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
[02:26.08]Life waits for us
[02:28.72]Share it with me
[02:31.02]The best is about to be
[02:34.69]So much is left for us to see
[02:38.44]When I hold you
[02:40.32]Baby, Baby
[02:42.08]Feels like maybe things will be all right
[02:46.79]Baby, Baby
[02:49.03]Your love's made me
[02:50.95]Free as a song singin' forever
[02:54.47]Only yesterday when I was sad
[02:58.55]And I was lonely
[03:01.03]You showed me the way to leave
[03:04.33]The past and all its tears behind me
[03:08.12]Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
[03:14.67]Since I threw my sadness away
[03:20.11]Only Yesterday
[03:24.03]Only yesterday when I was sad
[03:29.67]And I was lonely
[03:32.13]You showed me the way to leave
