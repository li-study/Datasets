[00:00.21]作词：田原
[00:00.61]作曲/编曲：李涛 刘利敏
[00:01.01]
[00:01.41]There is no sight,
[00:06.96]all the trees go black and blind.
[00:11.75]
[00:12.62]He's already been trapped,
[00:18.41]later he'll been sold abroad.
[00:23.46]
[00:24.17]Dreaming without sleep,
[00:29.84]wishing you could save his soul.
[00:34.74]
[00:35.34]Try to kill himself for free,
[00:41.04]bleed to make himself awake.
[00:45.95]
[00:46.89]He went off to be a freak,
[00:52.43]fight until the end of time.
[00:57.34]
[00:58.21]In the land of guilts and lies
[01:04.08]watching blood run out to dry.
[01:08.39]
[01:09.72]He can never slip away,
[01:15.36]waiting for a chance to slide.
[01:20.27]
[01:21.09]Turn around this world and cry,
[01:26.71]spell his name in mud with pride.
[01:31.87]
[01:55.45]There is no sight,
[02:01.13]all the trees go black and blind.
[02:06.07]
[02:06.79]He's already been trapped,
[02:12.50]later he'll been sold abroad.
[02:17.93]
[02:18.22]Dreaming without sleep,
[02:23.94]wishing you could save his soul.
[02:29.12]
[02:29.55]Try to kill himself for free,
[02:35.32]bleed to make himself awake.
[02:40.62]
[02:41.10]He went off to be a freak,
[02:46.65]fight until the end of time.
