[00:09.48][00:37.48][04:56.42]
[00:45.38]From the brightest star
[00:47.98]Comes the blackest hole
[00:50.80]You had so much to offer
[00:53.44]Why did you offer your soul?
[00:56.30]I was there for you baby
[00:58.99]When you needed my help
[01:01.70]Would you deny for others
[01:04.45]What you demand for yourself?
[01:07.69][01:13.06]Cool down mama, cool off
[01:18.16][02:15.60]You speak of signs and wonders
[01:23.23]I need something other
[01:28.60][02:26.12][03:46.16]I would believe if I was able
[01:34.13][02:31.78]But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
[01:53.91]You were pretty as a picture
[01:56.74]It was all there to see
[01:59.48]Then your face caught up with your psychology
[02:04.97]With a mouth full of teeth
[02:07.70]You ate all your friends
[02:10.40]And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends
[02:20.82][03:40.49]But I need something other
[02:51.99]Where you live should not decide
[02:57.39]Whether you live or whether you die
[03:03.69]Three to a bed
[03:06.27]Sister Ann, she said
[03:09.09]Dignity passes by
[03:35.02]And you speak of signs and wonders
[03:51.64]I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
[04:00.68][04:01.59]
