[00:10.50]She's Out Of My Life
[00:20.50]Michael Jackson
[00:30.50]
[00:40.50]She's out of my life
[00:48.00]She's out of my life
[00:55.50]And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
[01:03.00]I don't know whether to live or die
[01:09.00]And it cuts like a knife
[01:14.50]She's out of my life
[01:19.50]
[01:25.50]It's out of my hands
[01:32.50]It's out of my hands
[01:39.50]To think for two years she was here
[01:46.50]And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
[01:53.00]Now the way that it stands
[01:58.50]She's out of my hands
[02:01.50]
[02:05.50]So I've learned that loves not possession
[02:13.06]And I've learned that love won't wait
[02:20.30]Now I've learned that love needs expression
[02:26.23]But I've learned too late
[02:33.66]She's out of my life
[02:42.88]She's out of my life
[02:49.24]Damned in decision and cursed pride
[02:57.21]Kept my love for her locked deep inside
[03:03.59]And it cuts like a knife
[03:10.15]She's out of my life
[03:19.37]
