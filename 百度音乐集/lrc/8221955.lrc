[00:00.49]
[00:00.51]I need this to get me through
[00:06.47]can't resist and don't want to
[00:11.26]believe it I know it's true
[00:15.71]I can't beat and don't want to try
[00:19.58]
[00:30.25]perfect hell
[00:30.77]it's more to me than you ever will know
[00:33.27]down here where the rest of us fell
[00:34.89]waste away with nothing left to show
[00:37.56]while I'm in this perfect hell
[00:40.40]
[00:41.27]obsession has begun
[00:42.56]possessed by destruction
[00:45.70]how did I get so low
[00:47.82]believe me no one knows
[00:50.51]sometimes I can't hold on
[00:52.70]and no one can help me
[00:55.69]
[00:56.24]now it's got a hold of me
[00:57.91]I don't think I can make it through this
[01:00.10]now it's got a hold of me
[01:03.36]the less I do the more it makes no sense
[01:04.55]I'm walking pollution who's drained by delusions
[01:07.67]on the verge of destruction I cave in to abduction
[01:10.96]thin blood I'm bleeding my pulse won't stop racing
[01:14.28]just as my heart explodes
[01:15.76]
[01:16.28]no chance that I could win
[01:18.32]too hard to not give in
[01:20.87]I just don't feel the same
[01:22.51]cause I'm the one to blame
[01:26.06]sometimes I can't hold on
[01:28.67]and no one can help me
[01:31.10]now it's got a hold of me
[01:33.42]I don't think I can make it through this
[01:35.53]now it's got a hold of me
[01:37.83]the less I do the more it makes no sense
[01:39.85]
[01:40.71]I need this to be myself
[01:42.57]it feels like I need some help
[01:46.40]it's too late to save myself
[01:52.51]or it's just in my head
[01:55.03]
[01:56.43]now it's got a hold of me
[01:58.32]I don't think I can make it through this
[02:01.19]now it's got a hold of me
[02:04.39]the less I do the more it makes no sense
[02:05.56]now it's got a hold of me
[02:07.59]I don't think I can make it through this
[02:11.09]now it's got a hold of me
[02:13.77]the less I do the more it makes no sense
[02:16.50]
[02:22.07]BYE BYE~
