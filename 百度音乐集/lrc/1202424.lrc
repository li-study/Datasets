[00:12.39]Saw some pictures in the paper,
[00:17.38]of a girl I'd met the day before.
[00:23.19]I couldn't believe that hours later,
[00:28.25]I had reporters knockin at my door,
[00:32.58]But I used to dream about,
[00:35.55]the life I'm living now and,
[00:39.13]I didn't think I'd miss those things from the past,
[00:43.34]and I'm not afraid of leaving,
[00:46.70]or letting go of what I had,
[00:48.96]cause I realize that now there's no turning back.
[01:58.89][00:53.75]Cause I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love,
[02:04.64][00:59.57]so when tear drops fall from me like rain from above,
[02:10.08][01:04.97]I can brush my troubles away,
[02:14.18][01:08.99]know that deep down inside,
[02:18.24][01:13.09]I got sun shining in my life.
[01:17.45]I used to think I could get better,
[01:22.46]my girlfriends always used to get me wrong.
[01:28.21]Some just sent messages, love letters,
[01:33.16]but those kinda feelings never lasted long.
[01:37.69]Cause now the only love I find's within a castle made of sand,
[01:43.52]and when the tide goes out it's swept away.
[01:48.53]Though I got my peace of mind,
[01:51.67]and time is firmly on my side,
[01:54.26]and through the battles I can safely say...
[02:22.85](Music Break)
[02:42.46]Cause I mean I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love,
[02:48.06]so when tear drops fall from me like rain from above,
[02:53.54]I can brush my troubles away,
[02:57.61]know that deep down inside,
[03:01.72]I got sun shining in my life.
[03:05.44]I'm caught living in a world filled with love,
[03:09.78]so when tear drops fall from me like rain from above,
[03:15.15]I can brush my troubles away,
[03:19.19]know that deep down inside,
[03:24.07]I got sun shining in my life.
