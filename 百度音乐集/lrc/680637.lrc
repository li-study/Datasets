[00:34.22]
[00:36.22]In this world you tried
[00:40.59]Not leaving me alone behind.
[00:46.66]There's no other way.
[00:51.18]I prayed to the gods let him stay.
[00:57.60]The memories ease the pain inside,
[01:03.24]Now I know why.
[01:06.93]
[01:08.60]All of my memories keep you near.
[01:13.52]In silent moments imagine you here.
[01:19.09]All of my memories keep you near.
[01:24.00]Your silent whispers, silent tears.
[01:31.36]
[01:34.24]Made me promise I'd try
[01:38.66]To find my way back in this life.
[01:44.85]I hope there is a way
[01:49.09]To give me a sign you're ok.
[01:55.59]Reminds me again it's worth it all
[02:01.15]So I can go on.
[02:05.53]
[02:06.65]All of my memories keep you near.
[02:11.50]In silent moments imagine you here.
[02:17.08]All of my memories keep you near.
[02:22.06]Your silent whispers, silent tears.
[02:29.38]
[02:32.65]Together in all these memories
[02:37.93]I see your smile.
[02:43.15]All the memories I hold dear.
[02:48.57]Darling, you know I will love you
[02:52.48]Until the end of time.
[02:58.18]
[02:59.27]All of my memories keep you near.
[03:04.24]In silent moments imagine you here.
[03:09.84]All of my memories keep you near.
[03:14.84]Your silent whispers, silent tears.
