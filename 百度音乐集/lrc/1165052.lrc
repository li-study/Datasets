[00:41.96]Well I guess it would be nice
[00:44.51]If I could touch your body
[00:47.00]I know not everybody
[00:49.30]Has got a body like you
[00:52.21]But I've got to think twice
[00:54.54]Before I give my heart away
[00:57.00]And I know all the games you play
[00:59.27]Because I play them too
[01:01.69]Oh but I
[01:03.01]Need some time off from that emotion
[01:07.91]Time to pick my heart up off the floor
[01:12.03]And when that love comes down
[01:15.69]Without devotion
[01:17.83]Well it takes a strong man baby
[01:20.06]But I'm showing you the door
[01:22.20]'Cause I gotta have faith...
[01:32.64]Baby
[01:34.70]I know you're asking me to stay
[01:37.07]Say please, please, please, don't go away
[01:39.70]You say I'm giving you the blues
[01:41.82]Maybe
[01:44.65]You mean every word you say
[01:47.13]Can't help but think of yesterday
[01:49.60]And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
[01:52.78]Before this river
[01:55.26]Becomes an ocean
[01:57.91]Before you throw my heart back on the floor
[02:01.87]Oh baby I reconsider
[02:05.25]My foolish notion
[02:07.90]Well I need someone to hold me
[02:10.13]But I'll wait for something more
[02:12.36]Yes I've gotta have faith...
[02:43.10] Before this river
[02:45.33]Becomes an ocean
[02:48.07]Before you throw my heart back on the floor
[02:52.25]Oh baby I reconsider
[02:55.30]My foolish notion
[02:57.79]Well I need someone to hold me
[02:59.98]But I'll wait for something more
[03:04.76]cause I gotta have faith..
