[00:04.85]Title: The Letter
[00:06.41]
[00:15.86]You never liked to get
[00:19.09]The letters that I sent.
[00:22.32]But now you’ve got the gist
[00:26.51]Of what my letters meant.
[00:28.67]You’re reading them again,
[00:31.70]The ones you didn’t burn.
[00:34.79]You press them to your lips,
[00:38.95]My pages of concern.
[00:39.85]I said there’d been a flood.
[00:43.76]I said there’s nothing left.
[00:45.42]I hoped that you would come.
[00:47.87]I gave you my address.
[00:52.86]Your story was so long,
[00:56.59]The plot was so intense,
[00:57.37]It took you years to cross
[01:00.39]The lines of self-defense.
[01:05.37]The wounded forms appear:
[01:07.64]The loss, the full extent;
[01:11.85]And simple kindness here,
[01:14.49]The solitude of strength.
[01:19.15]You walk into my room.
[01:23.38]You stand there at my desk,
[01:26.74]Begin your letter to
[01:31.29]The one who’s coming next
