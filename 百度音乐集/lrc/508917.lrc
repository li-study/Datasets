[00:00.52]Leona Lewis - Alive
[00:03.52]
[00:11.54]I breathe
[00:12.88]I hear
[00:14.20]But I don't believe it
[00:16.88]My heart
[00:18.36]It beats
[00:19.79]But inside I'm freezing
[00:21.58]
[00:22.58]My hands
[00:23.90]They shake
[00:25.34]I've lost all the feeling
[00:28.23]Nowhere
[00:29.48]To take
[00:30.91]You say that you're leaving
[00:34.80]
[00:35.80]And there's no turning back this time
[00:41.36]Gotta stay alive
[00:47.99]Where do I go when I'm so alone
[00:53.47]Where do I turn when we weren't so close
[00:58.86]We try not to crash but we still collide
[01:03.03]Tears I've cried
[01:04.33]I'll survive
[01:05.79]I'm alive
[01:12.00]
[01:12.81]I'm stripped
[01:14.16]I'm bare
[01:15.49]I'm left here with nothing
[01:18.43]I hold
[01:19.71]The wheel
[01:21.04]Don't know where I'm going
[01:23.00]
[01:23.87]Your face
[01:25.24]I see
[01:26.61]In every reflection
[01:29.46]No time
[01:30.76]No space
[01:32.36]I've lost all direction
[01:36.26]
[01:37.26]And there's no turning back this time
[01:42.75]Gotta stay alive
[01:49.31]Where do I go when I'm so alone
[01:54.73]Where do I turn when we weren't so close
[02:00.21]We try not to crash but we still collide
[02:04.32]Tears I've cried
[02:05.67]I'll survive
[02:07.12]I'm alive
[02:08.36]
[02:09.36]I'm gonna get there someway
[02:11.99]Through all the tears and the rain
[02:14.80]And any road I can take
[02:17.62]Just to get me some place
[02:19.62]
[02:20.50]Where all the scars on my heart
[02:23.14]And all the lies in the dark
[02:26.37]Disappear in the headlights
[02:29.38]So bright, tonight, gonna drive them away
[02:35.75]
[02:36.75]Where do I go when I'm so alone
[02:42.21]Where do I turn when we weren't so close
[02:47.57]We try not to crash but we still collide
[02:51.77]Tears I've cried
[02:53.17]I'll survive
[02:54.58]I'm alive
[02:59.58]
[03:00.40]I'm alive
[03:06.53]I'm alive
[03:09.32]I'm alive
[03:12.52]Ooh
[03:16.78]
[03:17.78]I'm alive
[03:23.78]
