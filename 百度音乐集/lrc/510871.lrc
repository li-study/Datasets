[00:13.48]It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
[00:24.52]Without saying a word,
[00:28.02]you can light up the dark
[00:35.04]Try as I may I could never explain
[00:41.09]What I hear when you don't say a thing
[00:46.39]
[00:50.06]The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[00:55.40]There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[01:00.89]The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall
[01:09.31]
[01:12.39]You say it best.. when you say nothing at all
[01:18.86]
[01:29.40]All day long I can hear people talking out loud
[01:40.35]But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
[01:50.97]Try as they may they can never define
[01:56.88]What's been said between your heart and mine
[02:03.23]The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[02:08.55]There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[02:14.02]The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall
[02:22.18]
[02:25.53]You say it best.. when you say nothing at all
[02:35.81]
[02:53.05]The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[02:58.21]There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[03:06.48]The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall
[03:13.50]
[03:17.94]You say it best.. when you say nothing at all
[03:24.08]
[03:34.48](You say it best.. when you say nothing at all)
[03:39.97](You say it best.. when you say nothing at all)
[03:45.20]The smile on your face
[03:48.08]The truth in your eyes
[03:50.71]The touch of your hand
[03:52.79]Let's me know that you need me
[03:56.63](You say it best.. when you say nothing at all)
[04:02.06](You say it best.. when you say nothing at all)
