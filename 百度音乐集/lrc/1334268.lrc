[00:01.12]Green Day - See The Light
[00:07.89]
[00:13.88]I crossed the river
[00:17.34]Fell into the sea
[00:20.88]Where the non-believers
[00:24.33]Go beyond belief
[00:27.83]Then I scratched the surface
[00:31.34]In the mouth of hell
[00:34.77]Running our of service
[00:38.25]In the blood I fell
[00:40.80]
[00:41.73]I just want to see the light
[00:48.56]I don't want to lose my sight
[00:55.66]I just want to see the light
[01:02.06]I need to know what's worth the fight
[01:09.24]
[01:10.44]I've been wasted
[01:12.57]Pills and alcohol
[01:16.39]I've been chasing
[01:19.44]Down the pool halls
[01:22.87]Then I drank the water
[01:26.17]From a hurricane
[01:29.79]And I set a fire
[01:33.18]Just to see the flame
[01:35.66]
[01:36.65]I just want to see the light
[01:43.37]I don't want to lose my sight
[01:50.41]I just want to see the light
[01:56.75]I need to know what's worth the fight
[02:34.33]
[02:37.13]I crossed the desert
[02:40.56]Reaching higher ground
[02:44.01]Then I found the pavement
[02:47.43]To take the liars down But it's gone forever
[02:54.25]But never too late
[02:57.71]Where the ever after
[03:01.10]Is in the hands of fate
[03:03.58]
[03:04.55]I just want to see the light
[03:11.35]I don't want to lose my sight
[03:18.08]I just want to see the light
[03:24.81]I need to know what's worth the fight
[04:15.06]
