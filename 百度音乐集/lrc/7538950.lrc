[00:40.16]I wonder should I go or should I stay?
[00:46.86]The band had only one more song to play.
[00:52.90]And then I saw you out the corner of my eye,
[01:00.20]a little girl alone and so shy.
[01:04.43]I had the last waltz with you,
[01:12.62]two lonely people together.
[01:19.26]I fell in love with you.
[01:25.57]The last waltz should last forever.
[01:32.10]
[01:36.32]But the love we had was going strong.
[01:42.12]Through the good and bad,we get along.
[01:48.70]And then the flame of love died in your eyes.
[01:55.24]My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye.
[02:00.42]I had the last waltz with you,
[02:08.03]two lonely people together.
[02:14.57]I fell in love with you.
[02:20.95]The last waltz should last forever.
[02:28.59]It*s all over now,
[02:30.61]nothing left to say.
[02:33.41]Just my tears and the orchestra playing.
[02:40.59]La, la, al*"
[02:46.99]La, la, al*"
[02:54.52]I had the last waltz with you,
[02:59.92]two lonely people together.
[03:06.44]I fell in love with you.
[03:14.58]The last waltz should last forever.
[03:24.52]La, la, al..........
