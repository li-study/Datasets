[00:42.01]Gotta show
[00:43.41]Gotta stay
[00:44.59]I've gotta feeling that won't go away
[00:47.44]I've gotta know
[00:48.88]If they got away
[00:50.27]My opportunities
[00:52.27]
[00:53.04]Just one,
[00:55.12]Chance is all I ever wanted

[01:00.72]Time I'd like to win the game
[01:03.94]From now on,
[01:06.14]I'd take the chance if I can have it
[01:09.93]Just one, just one
[01:12.05]

[01:14.07]I need to feed
[01:15.54]I need to see if I still bleed
[01:18.37]I need a place
[01:19.79]I need a time
[01:21.20]Cause I need to step outside that line
[01:24.19]Gonna give
[01:25.69]Gonna take
[01:26.76]I'm gonna scream till I'm awake
[01:29.57]I'm gonna push

[01:32.42]Open up the door
[01:34.71]
[01:36.51]Just one,

[01:53.44]Just one, just one
[01:58.44]
[02:10.19]And if I knew
[02:13.06]When the door was open
[02:14.36]I'd go through
[02:16.63]I would go on through
[02:19.23]
[02:22.08]And I can say
[02:24.24]What I do never be the same
[02:27.93]Never be the same
[02:32.59]
[02:33.48]Just one,
