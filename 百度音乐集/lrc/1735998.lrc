[00:12.71]Sheryl Crow
[00:17.46]
[00:30.18]I woke up and called this morning
[00:35.66]The tone of your voice was a warning
[00:40.07]That you don't care for me anymore
[00:49.28]I made up the bed we sleep in
[00:53.43]I looked at the clock when you creep in
[00:58.45]It's 6 a.m. and I'm alone
[01:07.16]Did you know when you go
[01:09.63]It's the perfect ending
[01:11.82]To the bad day I was just beginning
[01:16.27]When you go all I know is
[01:19.14]You're my favorite mistake
[01:24.05]
[01:35.39]Your friends are sorry for me
[01:39.73]They watch you pretend to adore me
[01:44.43]But I'm no fool to this game
[01:53.24]Now here comes your secret lover
[01:58.33]She'd be unlike any other
[02:02.82]Until your guilt goes up in flames
[02:11.57]Did you know when you go
[02:13.83]It's the perfect ending
[02:16.23]To the bad day I was just beginning
[02:20.67]When you go all I know is
[02:23.48]You're my favorite mistake
[02:27.21]You're my favorite mistake
[02:33.80]Well maybe nothin' lasts forever
[02:37.94]Even when you stay together
[02:42.68]I don't need forever after
[02:47.12]It's your laughter won't let me go
[02:51.00]So I'm holding on this way
[02:59.76]
[03:12.62]Did you know, could you tell
[03:14.76]You were the only one
[03:17.78]That I ever loved
[03:21.81]Now everything's so wrong
[03:28.36]
[03:31.04]Did you see me walking by?
[03:35.54]Did it ever make you cry?
[03:42.94]You're my favorite mistake
[03:47.99]You're my favorite mistake
[03:51.77]You're my favorite mistake
