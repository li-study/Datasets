[00:00.00]Westlife--To be loved
[00:01.85]
[00:06.01]The song of a little bird
[00:10.57]The joy in three little words
[00:17.24]I know it's real
[00:19.21]That's how it feels
[00:21.60]To be loved by you
[00:28.24]The stars from a midnight sky
[00:33.38]The melody from a lullaby
[00:39.89]There's nothing real
[00:42.40]That I wouldn't steal
[00:43.81]To be loved by you
[00:49.95]To be loved by you
[01:32.67][00:55.84]If everybody knows
[01:34.54][00:57.96]It's only 'cause it shows
[01:02.00]A smile to put you on a high
[01:07.29]A kiss that sets your soul alight
[01:13.67]Would it be all right if I spent tonight
[01:24.27][01:18.10]Being loved by you
[01:39.42]Your love is released
[01:41.64]And you move me with ease
[01:44.54]And you rescue me time after time
[01:49.76]Oh Oh you give your all
[01:53.42]And you take it all in your stride
[02:00.92]Oh with all the power of a symphony
[02:08.32]That's how my heart beats when you're holding me
[02:13.36]I can't conceal, this is how it feels
[02:17.81]To be loved by you
[02:21.28]Oh yeah, to be loved by you
[02:28.80]If everybody knows, it's only 'cause it shows
[02:35.84]Because I take your love, Everywhere I go
[02:46.37]I know what it is I need
[02:53.25]it's clear as a shallow stream
[02:59.67]It's as it seems, my only dreams
[03:03.94]To be loved by you
