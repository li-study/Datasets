[00:00.00]Come See About Me Lyrics
[00:09.33]Artist(Band):The Supremes
[00:10.78]
[00:11.45]I've been crying
[00:15.68]'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
[00:19.54]Smiles have all turned to tears
[00:23.40]But tears won't wash away the fears
[00:27.11]That you're never ever gonna return
[00:30.98]To ease the fire that within me burns
[00:34.37]
[00:34.74]It keeps me crying baby for you
[00:38.25]Keeps me sighin' baby for you
[00:42.06]So won't you hurry ?
[00:44.92]Come on boy, see about me
[00:47.33](Come see about me)
[00:49.57]See about you baby
[00:52.45]
[00:53.48]I've given up my friends just for you
[00:56.85]My friends are gone
[00:58.69]And you have too
[01:00.80]No peace shall I find
[01:04.54]Until you come back
[01:06.87]And be mine
[01:09.43]No matter what you do or say
[01:12.86]I'm gonna love you anyway
[01:15.91]
[01:16.01]Keep on crying baby for you
[01:19.55]I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
[01:23.18]So come on hurry
[01:25.45]Come on and see about me
[01:29.00](Come see about me)
[01:30.79]See about you baby
[01:33.03]
[01:43.96]Sometime's up
[01:47.67]Sometime's down
[01:51.47]My life's so uncertain
[01:55.18]With you not around
[01:58.96]From my arms you maybe out of reach
[02:03.59]But my heart says you're here to keep
[02:06.79]
[02:07.02]Keeps me crying baby for you
[02:10.26]Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
[02:13.94]So won't you hurry
[02:16.14]Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)
[02:21.37]See about you baby (Come see about me)
[02:25.13]You know I'm so lonely (Come see about me)
[02:28.77]I love you only (Come see about me)
[02:32.69]See about your baby (Come see about me)
[02:36.32]Hurry, hurry
[02:37.83]------END------
