[00:30.79]
[00:31.58]Yeah, it's perfectly clear
[00:34.12]That love's not what you need
[00:35.69]I tell you I don't care
[00:37.40]But I don't want to
[00:39.47]Anything that you say
[00:41.16]I hear myself agree
[00:43.08]And I don't recognize
[00:44.95]What i've turned into,
[00:46.68]
[00:47.18]I don't know why I want you so
[00:51.89]'Cause I don't need the heart break

[01:44.98]But I don't want to
[01:46.90]Try to leave out the love
[01:48.70]That goes againt the grain
[01:50.59]But I can rationalize it
