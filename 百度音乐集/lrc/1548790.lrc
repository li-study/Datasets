[00:04.52]Broken Vow
[00:08.92]歌手：Lara Fabian
[00:14.53]
[00:41.65]Tell me her name
[00:43.66]I want to know
[00:48.46]The way she looks
[00:50.38]And where you go
[00:53.93]I need to see her face
[00:56.76]I need to understand
[01:01.75]Why you and I came to an end
[01:08.07]
[01:09.29]Tell me again
[01:11.19]I want to hear
[01:16.56]Who broke my faith in all these years
[01:21.63]Who lays with you at night
[01:24.28]When I'm here all alone
[01:29.15]Remembering when I was your own
[01:34.34]
[01:48.61]I'll let you go
[01:52.52]Now that I found
[01:56.26]A way to keep somehow
[02:03.10]More than a broken vow
[02:13.22]
[02:16.94]Tell me the words I never said
[02:23.67]Show me the tears you never shed
[02:28.53]Give me the touch
[02:30.51]That one you promised to be mine
[02:35.62]Or has it vanished for all time
[02:41.00]
[02:41.33]I'll let you go
[02:45.47]I'll let you fly
[02:48.33]Why do I keep on asking why
[02:54.26]I'll let you go
[02:57.79]Now that I found
[03:01.46]A way to keep somehow
[03:08.48]More than a broken vow
[03:16.07]I close my eyes
[03:19.99]And dream of you and I
[03:22.40]And then I realize
[03:26.40]There's more to life than only bitterness and lies
[03:32.55]I close my eyes
[03:39.87]
[03:49.11]I'd give away my soul
[03:51.68]To hold you once again
[03:56.13]And never let this promise
[04:01.27]I'll let you go
[04:01.40]I'll let you go
[04:05.23]I'll let you fly
[04:05.73]I'll let you fly
[04:08.33]Why do I keep on asking why
[04:08.65]Why do I keep on asking why
[04:14.49]I'll let you go
[04:17.84]Now that I found
[04:21.39]A way to keep somehow
[04:29.73]More than a broken vow
