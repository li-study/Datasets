[00:16.13]Saturday morning along and barely feeling
[00:20.15]Sitting at home after rocking and areeling
[00:24.18]All night in a cat fight
[00:27.56]With the only one that can make me cry
[00:33.27]Open the blinds and the world is in rotation
[00:36.18]Shaking my mind like an etch-a-sketch erasing
[00:40.03]Sunshine, you were bad, i’m
[00:43.46]Still mad but I can’t remember why
[00:48.19]I believe you know me well
[00:51.45]I react like you’re rining a bell
[00:55.11]Are you sorry that you treat me unkind
[00:59.45]Never you mind
[01:12.10]Rolling along to the song that aggravates us
[01:16.22]Beckoned on by the mirage of an oasis
[01:20.28]Hurry, I’m getting blurry
[01:23.49]And it’s no longer clear in my mind
[01:27.94]I believe you know me well
[01:31.25]I react like you’re ringing a bell
[01:35.15]Are you sorry that you treat me unkind
[01:39.21]Never you mind
[01:43.53]I believe I got you down
[01:47.06]You react like anybody else around
[01:51.30]Are you sorry that we wasted our time
[01:55.13]Never you mind
[02:04.50]Sometimes it takes all my time guessing why
[02:08.12]I can’t figure it out
[02:12.45]Sometimes it takes all my energy just to forget about
[02:15.95]All the memories that I’d be better off without
[02:29.15]I believe you know me well
[02:51.71]Switch on the box mr. spock is on the table
[02:55.17]Dr. mccoy is unable to connect his brain
[03:00.34]Sweatin and strainin
[03:01.97]Well it seemed so simple at the time
[03:07.10]I believe you know me well
[03:09.22]I react like you’re ringing a bell
[03:13.15]Are you sorry that you treat me unkind
[03:17.24]Never you mind
