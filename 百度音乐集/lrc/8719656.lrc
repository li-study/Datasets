[00:00.46]I Only Have Eyes For You
[00:03.06]-Art Garfunkel
[00:05.56]
[00:06.35]My love must be a kind of blind love
[00:14.67]I can't see anyone but you
[00:20.39]
[00:39.59]Are the stars out tonight?
[00:46.80]I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
[00:53.45]I only have eyes for you, dear
[01:09.69]
[01:12.58]The moon may be high
[01:18.21]But I can't see a thing in the sky
[01:26.36]'Cause I only have eyes for you
[01:39.33]
[01:44.29]I don't know if we're in a garden
[02:00.39]Or on a crowded avenue
[02:09.84]
[02:11.04]You are here, so am I
[02:22.39]Maybe millions of people go by
[02:30.24]But they all disappear from view
[02:45.78]And I only have eyes for you
[02:59.88]
