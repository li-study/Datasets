[00:32.73]When the sea falls from the shore
[00:36.63]As the light sinks low, will I see you any more?
[00:41.22]As the rain falls from the sky
[00:45.31]Can I bring you back, from a distant lullaby?
[00:50.10]Show me your vision, the story begun
[00:58.07]Two lights are rising and burning as one
[01:08.06]
[01:08.55]In the deep blue of the night
[01:12.35]Shine the millions of stars and my spirit burning bright
[01:17.04]Spinning on, into the sun, flying higher
[01:23.03]Now my journey's begun... And the...
[01:26.81]Cold, cold wind, it blows me away
[01:29.50]The feeling all over is a black, black day
[01:34.39]But I know that I'll see you again
[01:38.58]And I know that you're near me
[01:43.27]
[01:53.36]There's a star, calling my name
[01:56.95]It's echo is true and the song is not the same
[02:01.13]Take my hand and lead me away
[02:04.92]Bring me back to you in your arms I'm going to stay...
[02:09.52]Tell me your vision, the story begun
[02:18.29]Two lights are rising and burning as one
[02:27.27]
[02:28.17]All those years drifting in space
[02:32.17]I have known you well, yet I've never seen your face
[02:36.64]You turn around, looking at me, laughter in your eyes
[02:43.53]And now I can see
[02:45.44]And the cold, cold wind, it blows me away
[02:49.23]The feeling all over is a black, black day
[02:53.62]But I know that I'll see you again
[02:57.81]And I know that you're near me
