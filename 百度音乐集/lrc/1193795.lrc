[00:21.21]I sit and think about the day that you\'re gonna die,
[00:26.05]Your wrinkled eyes betrayed the joy with which you smiled.
[00:31.18]Care to see my reason?
[00:33.69]Care to put your life in mine?
[00:36.50]Lookin\' at life from the perspective of a boy
[00:41.30]Who\'s learned to love you but has also learned to grow.
[00:46.51]Could we make it better, stormy weather,
[00:49.80]So hard to know
[00:51.51]Oh, oh, oh - Is there anybody home?
[00:56.91]Who will believe me, won\'t deceive me,
[01:00.13]won\'t try to change me?
[01:01.71]Ah, ah, ah - Is there anybody home?
[01:07.10]Who wants to have me, just to love me?
[01:10.74]Stuck in the middle.
[01:13.02]
[01:22.34]I look at you,
[01:23.71]You look at me,
[01:24.97]We bite each other.
[01:27.46]And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter.
[01:32.53]But my troops are bigger than yours
[01:35.08]\'Cause you\'ll never stand my fight.
[01:37.93]Ours is a family that\'s based upon tradition
[01:42.76]But with my careless words I tread upon your vision.
[01:47.28]
[01:48.04]Are five kids better than one,
[01:50.47]who\'d doesn\'t like to be gone?
[01:52.90]Oh, oh, oh - Is there anybody home?
[01:58.34]Who will believe me, won\'t deceive me,
[02:01.61]won\' try to change me?
[02:03.12]Ah, ah, ah - Is there anybody home?
[02:08.44]Who wants to have me, just to love me?
[02:11.90]Stuck in the middle.
[02:14.93]Yea...Yea...Yea...
[02:23.96]This is to my name,
[02:26.25]This ain\'t a greater plan to break your heart of me.
[02:33.72]I know that what I\'ve started means that
[02:37.33]when we have parted
[02:38.97]I can live in honesty
[02:42.86]
[02:44.13]Oh, oh, oh - Is there anybody home?
[02:49.34]Who will believe me, won\'t deceive me,
[02:52.80]won\'t try to change me?
[02:54.23]Ah, ah, ah - Is there anybody home?
[02:59.60]Who wants to have me, just to love me?
[03:03.12]Stuck in the middle,
[03:08.25]Stuck in the middle,
[03:13.42]Stuck in the middle,
[03:18.53]Stuck in the middle
