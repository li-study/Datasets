[00:04.62]Neil Yang
[00:05.36]
[00:07.18]We'll do it all
[00:12.04]Everything
[00:16.66]On our own
[00:19.52]
[00:25.88]We don't need
[00:30.74]Anything
[00:34.86]Or anyone
[00:37.84]
[00:41.01]If I lay here
[00:45.42]If I just lay here
[00:50.02]Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
[00:55.91]
[01:02.69]I don't quite know
[01:07.42]How to say
[01:12.06]How I feel
[01:16.82]
[01:21.21]Those three words
[01:25.70]Are said too much
[01:30.30]They're not enough
[01:33.53]
[01:36.29]If I lay here
[01:40.86]If I just lay here
[01:45.53]Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
[01:51.24]
[01:54.55]Forget what we're told
[01:59.03]Before we get too old
[02:03.90]Show me a garden that's bursting into life
[02:09.82]
[02:16.74]Let's waste time
[02:21.27]Chasing cars
[02:25.81]Around our heads
[02:29.08]
[02:34.96]I need your grace
[02:39.50]To remind me
[02:44.14]To find my own
[02:47.28]
[02:50.24]If I lay here
[02:54.81]If I just lay here
[02:59.35]Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
[03:05.51]
[03:08.40]Forget what we're told
[03:13.05]Before we get too old
[03:17.79]Show me a garden that's bursting into life
[03:23.61]
[03:27.05]All that I am
[03:31.73]All that I ever was
[03:36.17]Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
[03:41.93]
[03:45.91]I don't know where
[03:49.97]Confused about how as well
[03:54.59]Just know that these things will never change for us at all
[04:00.51]
[04:04.11]If I lay here
[04:08.59]If I just lay here
[04:13.20]Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
