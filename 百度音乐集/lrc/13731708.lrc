[00:04.43]Lady Antebellum

[00:12.33]
[00:16.55]Ten cans on rattlin' pavement
[00:20.06]Confetti scattered everywhere
[00:24.16]She falls asleep in the seat beside me
[00:27.89]Grass caught up in her hair
[00:31.85]I don't mind it, I keep drivin
[00:35.77]flying on thesewheels of steel
[00:39.67]A bit anxious, a bit nervous
[00:43.72]The moments all that we can feel
[00:46.22]
[00:47.03]If fall is the soul of the engine
[00:50.78]And wine is the drink of the gods
[00:54.83]Forgiveness the road to redemption
[00:58.78]Faith can still beat the odds
[01:02.90]We're meant to be baby hold onto me
[01:06.52]You'll never not be my girl
[01:10.57]Cause love is the heart of the world
[01:15.22]
[01:22.65]I leave him sleepin as I rise early
[01:26.36]Always up before the dawn
[01:30.31]The house is dark, but I see clearly
[01:34.19]Kettle sings a morning song
[01:38.13]The bacons frying, babies crying
[01:42.07]I soke up the sights and sounds
[01:45.94]Minutes turn to days and I
[01:50.23]wish that I could slow it down
[01:52.94]
[01:53.42]If grease is the soul of the kitchen
[01:57.19]And coffee the drink of the gods
[02:01.08]Routine to perfect to mention
[02:05.01]Time is a thief I would rob
[02:09.36]We're meant to be baby hold onto me
[02:12.87]I'll never not be your girl
[02:16.83]Cause love is the heart of the world
[02:21.64]
[02:34.54]Ohh, and hope is the soul of the dreamer
[02:40.13]And heaven is the home of my god
[02:43.76]It only takes one true believer
[02:47.61]To believe you can still beat the odds
[02:52.39]
[02:54.14]Were meant to be baby hold onto me
[02:57.51]You'll never not be my girl
[02:59.84]I'll never not be your girl
[03:03.66]Cause love is the heart, love is the heart
[03:11.39]Love is the heart of the world
