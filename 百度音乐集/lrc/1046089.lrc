[00:00.00]John Mayer - Bigger Than My Body
[00:15.43]
[00:17.43]This is a call to the colorblind
[00:21.51]This is an IOU
[00:25.20]I'm stranded behind the horizon line
[00:29.14]Tied up in something true
[00:32.27]
[00:33.88]Yes I'm grounded
[00:35.83]Got my wings clipped
[00:37.59]I'm surrounded by all this pavement
[00:41.94]Guess I'll circle
[00:43.92]While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
[00:49.05]
[00:50.15]Someday I'll fly
[00:52.78]Someday I'll soar
[00:58.30]Someday I'll be so damn much more
[01:07.22]Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
[01:13.86]
[01:17.38]Why is it not the time?
[01:20.68]What is there more to learn?
[01:24.73]I shed this skin I've been triping in
[01:28.53]Never to quite return
[01:31.38]
[01:32.69]Yes I'm grounded
[01:34.91]Got my wings clipped
[01:36.94]I'm surrounded by all this pavement
[01:41.04]Guess I'll circle
[01:43.03]While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
[01:48.12]
[01:49.25]Someday I'll fly
[01:51.84]Someday I'll soar
[01:57.35]Someday I'll be so damn much more
[02:06.24]Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
[02:14.47]Cause I'm bigger than my body now
[02:22.23]
[02:39.89]Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
[02:47.57]And it might be over in a second's time
[02:55.74]But I'll gladly go down in a flame
[02:59.51]If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
[03:03.46]To remember my name, yeah
[03:06.67]Yes I'm grounded
[03:08.65]Got my wings clipped
[03:10.61]I'm surrounded by all this pavement
[03:14.75]Guess I'll circle
[03:16.70]While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
[03:22.58]Wait for my fuse to dry
[03:24.92]Someday I'll fly
[03:27.57]Someday I'll soar
[03:33.13]Someday I'll be so damn much more
[03:41.92]Cause I'm bigger than my body
[03:46.76]I'm bigger than my body
[03:50.98]I'm bigger than my body now
[03:56.54]
