[00:13.00]I'm having trouble trying to sleep
[00:19.00]I'm counting sheep but running out
[00:26.00]As time ticks by
[00:29.00]And still I try
[00:32.00]No rest for crosstops in my mind
[00:36.00]On my own... Here we go!
[02:06.00][00:51.00]My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
[02:13.00][00:57.00]Dried up and bulging out my skull
[02:19.00][01:04.00]My mouth is dry
[02:22.00][01:07.00]My face is numb
[02:25.00][01:10.00]Fucked up and spun out in my room
[02:30.00][01:14.00]On my own... Here we go!
[01:29.00]My mind is set on overdrive
[01:35.00]The clock is laughing in my face
[01:41.00]A crooked spine
[01:44.00]My senses dulled
[01:48.00]Passed the point of delerium
[01:52.00]On my own... Here we go!
