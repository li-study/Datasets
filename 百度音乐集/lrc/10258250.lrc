[00:21.14]If you twist and turn away
[00:31.00]If you tear yourself in two again
[00:40.87]If I could, yes I would
[00:45.61]If I could, I would
[00:50.16]Let it go
[00:55.76]Surrender
[01:00.45]Dislocate
[01:11.22]If I could throw this
[01:14.93]Lifeless lifeline to the wind
[01:20.14]Leave this heart of clay
[01:23.79]See you walk, walk away
[01:29.90]Into the night
[01:35.24]And through the rain
[01:40.18]Into the half-light
[01:45.01]And through the flame
[01:50.94]If I could through myself
[01:55.66]Set your spirit free
[01:59.13]I'd lead your heart away
[02:02.96]See you break, break away
[02:09.72]Into the light
[02:14.30]And to the day
[02:37.98]To let it go
[02:42.91]And so to fade away
[02:47.71]To let it go
[02:52.35]And so fade away
[02:57.66]I'm wide awake
[03:02.07]I'm wide awake
[03:07.10]Wide awake
[03:12.66]I'm not sleeping
[03:17.64]Oh, no, no, no
[03:33.11]If you should ask then maybe they'd
[03:37.99]Tell you what I would say
[03:41.72]True colors fly in blue and black
[03:46.34]Bruised silken sky and burning flag
[03:51.25]Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes
[04:02.52]If I could, you know I would
[04:06.99]If I could, I would
[04:11.18]Let it go...
[04:15.96]This desperation
[04:20.82]Dislocation
[04:25.32]Separation
[04:28.33]Condemnation
[04:30.30]Revelation
[04:32.52]In temptation
[04:34.90]Isolation
[04:37.32]Desolation
[04:39.45]Let it go
[04:44.13]And so fade away
[04:48.62]To let it go
[04:53.40]And so fade away
[04:58.23]To let it go
[05:03.00]And so to fade away
[05:07.79]I'm wide awake
[05:12.49]I'm wide awake
[05:17.29]Wide awake
[05:22.16]I'm not sleeping
[05:27.80]Oh, no, no, no
