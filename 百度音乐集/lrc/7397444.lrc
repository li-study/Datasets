[00:00.00]Elvis Presley - Return To Sender
[00:00.00]
[00:01.92]Return to sender
[00:05.53]Return to sender
[00:07.29]
[00:08.83]I gave a letter to the postman,
[00:12.44]He put it in his sack.
[00:15.78]Bright in early next morning,
[00:19.23]He brought my letter back.
[00:21.65]
[00:22.03]She wrote upon it:
[00:23.56]Return to sender, address unknown.
[00:31.37]No such number, no such zone.
[00:38.00]We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
[00:44.99]I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back.
[00:50.57]
[00:52.22]So then I dropped it in the mailbox
[00:55.91]And sent it special D.
[00:59.59]Bright in early next morning
[01:02.73]It came right back to me.
[01:04.99]
[01:05.43]She wrote upon it:
[01:07.21]Return to sender, address unknown.
[01:14.74]No such person, no such so.
[01:19.60]
[01:21.60]This time I'm gonna take it myself
[01:24.60]And put it right in her hand.
[01:28.20]And if it comes back the very next day
[01:32.05]Then I'll understand - the writing on it
[01:35.76]Return to sender, address unknown.
[01:43.78]No such number, no such zone.
[01:48.96]
[01:50.76]Return to sender, return to sender
[01:57.85]Return to sender, return to sender
[02:03.78]
