[00:00.26]The Blessing
[00:07.33]Celtic Woman
[00:18.62]
[00:24.87]In the morning when you rise
[00:29.58]I bless the sun, I bless the skies
[00:35.70]I bless your lips, I bless your eyes
[00:41.14]My blessing goes with you
[00:46.28]
[00:47.21]In the nighttime when you sleep
[00:51.56]Oh I bless you while a watch I keep
[00:58.51]As you lie in slumber deep
[01:03.15]My blessing goes with you
[01:08.01]
[01:08.93]This is my prayer for you
[01:12.36]There for you, ever true
[01:16.19]Each, every day for you
[01:19.92]In everything you do
[01:23.22]
[01:24.14]And when you come to me
[01:28.50]And hold me close to you
[01:35.86]I bless you
[01:35.79]And you bless me, too
[01:49.29]
[01:54.06]When your weary heart is tired
[01:58.91]If the world would leave you uninspired
[02:04.66]When nothing more of love's desired
[02:09.98]My blessing goes with you
[02:14.53]
[02:16.14]When the storms of life are strong
[02:20.72]When you're wounded, when you don't belong
[02:27.07]When you no longer hear my song
[02:32.71]My blessing goes with you
[02:37.67]
[02:38.26]This is my prayer for you
[02:42.00]There for you, ever true
[02:46.01]Each, every day for you
[02:49.78]In everything you do
[02:53.27]
[02:54.11]And when you come to me
[02:58.46]And hold me close to you
[03:06.42]I bless you
[03:08.93]And you bless me, too
[03:15.48]
[03:18.86]I bless you
[03:22.43]And you bless me, too
[03:31.69]
[03:40.19]The end
