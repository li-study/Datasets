[00:00.51]we made plans to be unbreakable,
[00:06.17]love was all we knew.
[00:10.69]no insurance for the unthinkable,
[00:16.31]blindly get us through.
[00:20.85]we've been searching for a lifetime,
[00:26.46]short as it may seem.
[00:30.97]riding on the fumes that spark us,
[00:36.62]while igniting dreams.
[00:41.95]mistakes we knew we were making.
[00:45.72]mistakes we knew we were making.
[00:49.71]don't think about chances we're taking,
[00:53.12]mistakes we knew...
[00:57.16]do da na na na..
[01:01.20]do da na na na..
[01:13.60]driving in the rain to the hospital,
[01:19.49]quiet makes it intense,
[01:23.95]WHAT AT ONCE JUST SEEMED THE IMPOSSIBLE
[01:29.83]now makes perfect sense.
[01:34.18]we held hands to face the uncomfortable cold,
[01:39.80]and lonely room.
[01:44.41]magazines and empty distractions
[01:50.41]barely got us through.
[01:55.50]mistakes we knew we were making.
[01:59.05]mistakes we knew we were making.
[02:03.29]don't think about chances we're taking,
[02:06.25]mistakes we knew...
[02:10.39]do da na na na..
[02:18.45]do da na na na..
[02:27.50]and when we try to think of the life inside,
[02:33.05]we found ourselves looking at the world through new eyes.
[03:06.97]what can now be said?
[03:10.83]oh, little one on the other side.
[03:17.01]dance until the band stops playing,
[03:23.29]sing with all your might.
[03:28.75]mistakes we knew we were making.
[03:32.38]mistakes we knew we were making.
[03:36.45]don't think about chances we're taking,
[03:40.48]don't think about rules we were breaking.
[03:44.71]mistakes we knew...
[03:51.33]the list goes on and on.
[03:59.19]the list goes on and on.
[04:07.30]the list goes on and on...
[04:15.29](until end)
[04:16.46]
