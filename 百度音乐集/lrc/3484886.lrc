[00:01.67].
[00:03.35]
[00:06.28].
[00:14.28]I remember the beginning,
[00:17.41]when we danced in the kitchen, now you won''t
[00:23.78]You used to throw your arms around me,
[00:26.91]say you couldn''t live without me,
[00:29.78]But now you don''t
[00:33.85]I don''t want to see the truth in here tonight
[00:40.10]So baby, maybe we should just turn out the light
[00:44.35].
[00:44.97]I''d rather be blind, than to watch you walk away
[00:51.41]I''d rather not hear, than to have to hear you say
[00:57.91]But baby, you''re not sure, you even love me anymore
[01:04.10]I''d rather be wrong, about that look in your eyes
[01:10.54]I''d rather not know, you''re about to say goodbye
[01:16.54]I can''t pretend that I don''t see
[01:19.72]While you''re lying here with me
[01:22.97]There''s somewhere else you''d rather be
[01:26.91].
[01:31.41]I thought I made you happy,
[01:34.35]so why can''t you look at me, anymore
[01:40.91]Cause this room feels so empty,
[01:43.85]like you''ve already left me, close the door
[01:50.48]It''s easier to lie here in the dark
[01:56.91]So I don''t have to see what''s hidden in your heart
[02:01.66].
[02:01.91]I''d rather be blind, than to watch you walk away
[02:08.10]I''d rather not hear, than to have to hear you say
[02:14.79]But baby, you''re not sure, you even love me anymore
[02:20.85]I''d rather be wrong, about that look in your eyes
[02:27.35]I''d rather not know, you''re about to say goodbye
[02:33.41]I can''t pretend that I don''t see
[02:36.54]While you''re lying here with me
[02:39.73]There''s somewhere else you''d rather be
[02:45.02].
[02:52.98]I''d rather be blind, than to watch you walk away
[02:59.42]I''d rather not hear, than to have to hear you say
[03:05.73]But baby, you''re not sure, you even love me anymore
[03:12.29]I''d rather be wrong, about that look in your eyes
[03:18.04]I''d rather not know, you''re about to say goodbye
[03:24.54]I can''t pretend that I don''t see
[03:27.67]While you''re lying here with me
[03:30.92]There''s somewhere else you''d rather be
[03:34.66].
[03:37.35]Somewhere else you''d rather be
[03:40.42].
[03:41.60]
