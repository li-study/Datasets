[00:01.95]
[00:24.38]‘静态脉冲’Q：21281770
[00:30.73]
[00:31.28]Don't I seem better
[00:36.75]Don't I seem just fine
[00:41.72]I've been writing you love letters
[00:46.98]One at a time
[00:51.75]
[00:52.31]Keep my thoughts in order
[00:57.51]Put my love on the line
[01:02.32]But you came along and took it all down
[01:07.21]Put your laundry up to dry
[01:11.42]
[01:13.12]No matter how hard I try
[01:18.25]Don't think you'll ever see
[01:23.46]That your love is a perfect blindfold for me
[01:29.58]
[01:39.01]You swim in and out of my heart
[01:44.25]Like a fish in a bowl
[01:49.27]It's getting warmer with summer approaching
[01:54.08]But still my feet are cold
[01:58.82]
[02:00.32]And no matter how hard I try
[02:05.47]Don't think you'll ever see
[02:10.55]That your love is a perfect blindfold for me
[02:16.95]
[02:20.56]Alone is good for me
[02:22.32]It's where I'd rather be
[02:24.66]But I could always use the company
[02:29.38]When no one else will do and I still will want you
[02:34.36]Yeah, I still want you
[02:41.22]And no one else will do
[02:44.67]
[02:54.25]Go on push me away
[02:59.43]It's the least you can do
[03:04.64]My eyes are soar and my feet are tired
[03:08.69]Baby, I'm sick of chasing you
[03:13.25]
[03:14.46]And no matter how hard I try
[03:19.42]Don't think you'll ever see
[03:24.53]That your love is a perfect blindfold for me
[03:35.03]No matter how hard I try
[03:40.39]Don't think you'll ever see
[03:45.53]That your love is a perfect blindfold
[03:51.98]For me
[03:53.97]
