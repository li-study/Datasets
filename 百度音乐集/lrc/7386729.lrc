[00:34.74]Every time we say goodbye I die a little
[00:50.03]Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
[01:06.78]Why the Gods above me who must be in the know
[01:22.39]Think so little of me, they allow you to go
[01:35.90]
[03:46.67][01:38.30]When you're near
[03:50.27][01:42.85]there's such an air of spring about it
[04:02.66][01:54.20]I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
[04:18.54][02:10.05]There's no love song finer but how strange
[04:26.72][02:19.46]The change from major to minor
[04:50.90][04:34.73][02:26.02]Every time we say goodbye
[05:05.32][04:47.58][02:35.99]
