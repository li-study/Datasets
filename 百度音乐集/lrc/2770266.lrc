[00:00.00]Desperately
[00:11.00]My heart is out of control
[00:14.00]This ole love struck soul
[00:17.00]Just lives for the moment you're around
[00:22.00]When I hold on to you
[00:26.00]It is all I can do just to keep my feet on the ground
[00:35.00]Desperately, Loving you desperately
[00:40.00]When you're not here with me
[00:43.00]I get a little bit crazy
[00:47.00]Constantly, I think about you constantly
[00:52.00]Look at what you've done to me
[00:54.00]I'm just like a little baby
[00:59.00]Oh, I love you desperately
[01:13.00]Will I laugh, will I cry?
[01:14.50]Will I live, will I die?
[01:19.00]It all depends upon you
[01:24.00]And it is dangerous I know
[01:27.00]To be lost in you so
[01:30.50]But I am and there's nothing I can do
[01:37.00]Desperately, Loving you desperately
[01:42.00]When you're not here with me
[01:45.00]I get a little bit crazy
[01:49.00]Constantly, I think about you constantly
[01:54.00]Look at what you've done to me
[01:56.00]I'm just like a little baby
[02:01.00]Oh, I love you desperately
[02:15.00]Desperately, Loving you desperately
[02:20.00]When you're not here with me
[02:22.50]I get a little bit crazy
[02:27.00]Constantly, I think about you constantly
[02:32.00]Look at what you've done to me
[02:34.50]I'm just like a little baby
[02:39.00]Oh, I love you desperately
