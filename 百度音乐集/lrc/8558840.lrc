[00:01.05]Sleepsong
[00:03.87]Secret garden
[00:06.69]
[00:23.69]Lay down your head,
[00:27.09]And I''ll sing you a lullaby Back to the years,
[00:35.57]Of loo-li lai-lay;
[00:39.73]And I''ll sing you to sleep…
[00:44.10]And I''ll sing you tomorrow…
[00:48.55]Bless you with love,
[00:51.81]For the road that you go.
[00:55.75]
[01:03.62]May you sail fair,
[01:06.89]To the far fields of fortune,
[01:11.17]With diamonds and pearls,
[01:14.91]At your head and your feet;
[01:19.20]And may you need never
[01:23.60]To banish misfortune;
[01:27.93]May you find kindness,
[01:31.98]In all that you meet.
[01:35.77]
[01:38.09]May there always be angels,
[01:42.18]To watch over you;
[01:46.38]To guide you each step of the way;
[01:54.61]To guard you and keep you
[01:59.27]Safe from all harm;
[02:03.96]Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay.
[02:09.42]
[02:52.30]May you bring love,
[02:55.50]And may you bring happiness;
[03:00.14]Be loved in return,
[03:03.72]To the end of your days;
[03:07.88]Now, fall off to sleep,
[03:12.10]I''m not meaning to keep you,
[03:16.65]I''ll just sit for a while,
[03:20.27]And sing loo-li, lai-lay.
[03:27.61]May there always be angels,
[03:30.71]To watch over you;
[03:35.16]To guide you each step of the way;
[03:43.50]To guard you and keep you
[03:48.33]Safe from all harm;
[03:52.65]Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay.
[04:01.38]Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay.
