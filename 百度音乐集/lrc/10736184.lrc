[00:02.90]I Wanna Dance With Somebody
[00:08.22]
[00:33.49]Clocks strikes upon the hour
[00:36.80]And the sun begins to fade
[00:41.32]Still enough time to figure out
[00:45.06]How to chase my blues away
[00:49.29]I've done alright up 'til now
[00:52.81]It's the light of day that shows me how
[00:56.97]And when the night falls loneliness calls
[01:01.95]
[01:03.63]Oh! Wanna dance with somebody

[01:43.04]Spinning through the town
[01:47.82]Soon or later the fever ends
[01:51.18]And I wind up feeling down
[01:55.96]I need a man who'll take a chance
[01:58.94]On a love that burns hot enough to last
[02:03.54]So when the night falls
[02:06.72]My lonely heart calls
[02:10.25]Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
[02:14.63]I wanna feel the heat with somebody
