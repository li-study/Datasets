[00:14.72]You could be my unintended
[00:21.10]Choice to live my life extended
[00:27.94]You could be the one I''ll always love
[00:42.49]You could be the one who listens
[00:48.67]to my deepest inquisitions
[00:55.73]You could be the one I''ll always love
[01:09.80]I''ll be there as soon as I can
[01:16.19]But I''m busy mending broken
[01:23.00]pieces of the life I had before
[01:37.34]First there was the one who challenged
[01:44.15]All my dreams and all my balance
[01:50.58]She could never be as good as you
[02:04.54]You could be my unintended
[02:11.34]Choice to live my life extended
[02:18.27]You should be the one I''ll always love
[02:32.03]I''ll be there as soon as I can
[02:38.84]But I''m busy mending broken
[02:45.78]pieces of the life I had before
[02:59.77]I''ll be there as soon as I can
[03:06.38]But I''m busy mending broken
[03:13.07]pieces of the life I had before
[03:24.16]Before you
