[00:08.29]Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for
[00:10.59]a different kind of introduction
[00:13.72]A monster had arrived in the village
[00:16.24]The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
[00:20.94]And this person or thing is soon to be met
[00:23.99]He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
[00:27.82]Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I?
[00:30.52]I forgot to introduce you to the monster.
[00:32.36]You're fearing me, ause you know I'm a beast
[00:36.67]Watching you when you sleep, 
[00:39.09]when you're in bed I'm underneath
[00:42.25]You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
[00:46.56]I'm the floor when you fall, 
[00:48.80]and when you scream it's ause of me
[00:51.80]I'm the living dead, 
[00:53.93]the dark thoughts in your head
[00:56.39]I know just what you said
[00:59.00]That's why you've got to be threatened by me
[01:02.18]You should be watching me, 
[01:04.50]you should feel threatened
[01:07.17]Why you sleep, why you creep, 
[01:09.42]you should be threatened
[01:11.94]Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
[01:16.89]Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
[01:21.82]
[01:23.67]You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
[01:28.49]I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
[01:33.93]Your worst nightmare, it's me I'm everywhere
[01:38.39]In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
[01:44.06]I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb 
[01:48.40]I'm the one watching you
[01:50.83]That's why you got to be threatened by me
[01:54.16]You should be watching me,
[01:56.52]you should feel threatened
[01:59.04]Why you sleep, why you creep, 
[02:01.49]you should be threatened
[02:04.09]Every time your lady speaks 
[02:06.33]she speaks to me, threatened
[02:08.92]Half of me you'll never be, 
[02:11.26]so you should feel threatened by me
[02:13.88]
[02:16.51]The unknown monster is about to embark
[02:18.99]From a far corner, out of the dark
[02:21.47]A nightmare, that's the case
[02:23.94]Never Neverland, that's the place
[02:26.30]This particular monster can read minds
[02:28.86]Be in two places at the same time
[02:31.34]This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
[02:33.79]The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
[02:36.27]You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
[02:38.78]A human presence that you feel is strange
[02:41.22]A monster that you can see disappear
[02:43.70]A monster, the worst thing to fear
[02:45.76]
[02:46.10]You should be watching me, 
[02:48.41]you should feel threatened
[02:51.11]Why you sleep, why you creep, 
[02:53.43]you should be threatened
[02:56.06]Every time your lady speaks 
[02:58.35]she speaks to me, threatened
[03:00.90]Half of me you'll never be, 
[03:03.26]so you should feel threatened
[03:05.87]You should be threatened
[03:10.87]Why you sleep threatened
[03:15.70]Every time threatened
[03:20.76]Half of me you should feel threatened by me
[03:25.72]You should be watching me, 
[03:28.03]you should feel threatened
[03:30.66]Why you sleep, why you creep, 
[03:33.00]you should be threatened
[03:35.57]Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
[03:40.47]Half of me you'll never be, 
[03:42.70]so you should feel threatened by me
[03:45.37]You should be watching me, 
[03:47.73]you should feel threatened
[03:50.38]Why you sleep, why you creep, 
[03:52.76]you should be threatened

[04:00.30]Half of me you'll never be, 
[04:02.46]so you should feel threatened by me
[04:05.82]What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly
[04:08.72]terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning
[04:13.29]beginning，beginning，beginning
