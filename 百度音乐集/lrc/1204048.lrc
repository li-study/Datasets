[00:02.77]Bob Dylan "Song To Woody"歌词
[00:06.00]I'm out here a thousand miles from my home
[00:13.42]Walkin' a road other men have gone down
[00:20.01]I'm seein' your world of people and things
[00:25.83]Hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
[00:36.19]Hey, hey, woody guthrie, i wrote you a song
[00:42.47]'bout a funny old world that's a-comin' along
[00:49.00]Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn
[00:55.95]It looks like it's a-dyin' and it's hardly been born.
[01:05.07]Hey, woody guthrie, but i know that you know
[01:12.00]All the things i'm a-sayin', and many times more
[01:18.98]I'm a-singin' every song, but i can't sing enough
[01:25.81]Cause there's not many men done the things that you done.
[01:34.67]Here's to cisco and sonny and leadbelly, too
[01:42.00]And to all the good people that traveled with you
[01:48.72]Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
[01:55.06]That come with the dust and are gone with the wind
[02:04.79]I'm a-leavin' tomorrow, but i could leave today
[02:11.08]Somewhere down the road someday
[02:18.24]The very last thing that i'd want to do
[02:23.86]Is to say i'd been hittin' some hard travelin' too.
[02:30.32]
