[00:17.63]Why can't you see
[00:19.65]That I'm still mad about you
[00:23.65]Even though I've found out about you
[00:27.62]I'll always stay forever true
[00:32.40]And in my heart
[00:34.64]I will forgive you
[00:37.17]I've got so much love to give you
[00:40.89]It's never too late
[00:42.41]We've still got time
[00:44.89]It's never too late
[00:46.40]You can still be mine
[00:48.37]It's never too late
[00:51.85]To change your mind
[00:55.08]
[00:57.61]Why can't you try
[00:59.61]And be a man about it
[01:03.34]And if you stop and think about it
[01:07.73]You just can't keep walking out on me
[01:12.46]And even if it takes forever
[01:17.21]Your love's better late than never
[01:20.96]It's never too late
[01:22.46]We've still got time
[01:24.95]It's never too late
[01:26.52]You can still be mine
[01:28.48]It's never too late
[01:31.96]To change your mind
[01:35.19]
[01:36.94]It's never too late
[01:40.92]It's never too late
[01:44.49]It's never too late
[01:47.92]To change your mind
[01:51.19]
[01:53.68]Though I try
[01:56.20]I can never put you from my mind
[02:00.46]You just creep right back inside
[02:04.45]And there's no place I can hide
[02:09.20]
[02:24.56]And in my heart
[02:26.72]I will forgive you
[02:29.22]I've got so much love to give you
[02:32.98]It's never too late
[02:34.49]We've still got time
[02:36.95]It's never too late
[02:38.48]You can still be mine
[02:40.43]It's never too late
[02:43.94]To change your mind
[02:47.30]
[02:48.96]It's never too late
[02:50.50]We've still got time
[02:52.95]It's never too late
[02:54.47]You can still be mine
[02:56.46]It's never too late
[02:59.96]To change your mind
