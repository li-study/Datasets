[00:01.31]Call Me
[00:03.97]Groove Coverage
[00:06.12]
[00:16.62]Inside every memory of you and me
[00:20.43]the rain begins to fall.
[00:23.28]In an ocean of my fears
[00:25.81]I know you won't be leaving me at all.
[00:30.12]All your everlastin words in dead
[00:33.40]old letters prophedied the end.
[00:36.91]But I never ever stop believing
[00:40.02]that our waste souls are bent.
[00:43.67]
[00:44.30]When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
[00:50.91]When you call me I'll be there for you.
[00:57.50]When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
[01:04.70]When you call me I'll be there for you.
[01:10.90]
[01:59.50]I'm remembering the scars and wounds
[02:02.44]I know you suffered from the rain.
[02:05.98]Is there anything that I can do to free
[02:10.52]your soul from all the pain.
[02:13.10]With your everlasting words you tried
[02:16.09]so hard to tell me that your gone.
[02:19.80]But I never ever start believing
[02:22.86]that you leave me all alone.
[02:25.73]
[02:27.08]When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
[02:33.76]When you call me I'll be there for you.
[02:40.35]When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
[02:47.53]When you call me I'll be there for you.
