[00:13.87]A Reminder
[00:28.48]Radiohead
[01:24.07]If I get old
[01:28.43]I will not give in
[01:35.49]But if I do
[01:39.91]Remind me of this
[01:46.10]
[01:47.09]Remind me that
[01:51.98]Once I was free
[01:59.33]Once I was cool
[02:03.73]Once I was me
[02:09.24]
[02:10.61]And if I sat down
[02:15.10]And crossed my arms
[02:22.36]Hold me into
[02:26.41]This song
[02:30.94]
[02:33.93]Knock me out
[02:38.38]Smash out my brains
[02:42.86]If I take a chair
[02:47.29]Start to talk shit
[02:51.76]
[03:03.62]If I get old
[03:07.89]Remind me of this
[03:14.87]That night we kissed
[03:18.78]And I really meant it
[03:25.11]
[03:26.05]Whatever happens
[03:31.04]If we're still speaking
[03:37.82]Pick up the phone
[03:41.83]Play me this song
