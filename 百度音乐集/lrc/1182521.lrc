[00:12.47]1 - Ooh baby, mm
[00:17.46]When you hold me
[00:20.35]Oh oh, when you hold me
[00:32.38]The sound
[00:35.53]Is it possible I could feel this cool
[00:41.15]I could really love you the way I do
[00:46.81]Is it possible I could feel this good
[00:52.52]I could really love you the way I do
[00:57.84]2 - See me (Within the light)
[01:01.08]Flowing (Take me to you)
[01:03.90]Like the river to the sea
[01:06.09]You come down
[01:12.08]You cover (Pull me to you)
[01:14.81]And the waves rush over me
[01:20.49]I feel a love light rush over me
[01:24.68]I feel the love turn to me
[01:31.92]And then your love just creeps over me
[01:36.68]Over me
[02:29.08]3 - And I won’t let you go
[02:34.62]I won’t let you go
[02:40.24]And I won’t let you go
[02:45.99]I won’t let you go
[02:51.78]4 - Take up your love
[02:52.99]Take up your love
[02:54.37]Take up your love
[02:55.62]And come to me
[03:04.10]This love’s not a lia
[03:05.43]To cold, it’s a fire
[03:06.88]I’m on the run
[03:08.19]And it’s a comfort to me
