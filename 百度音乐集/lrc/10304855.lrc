[00:16.66]Let me take you by the hand,
[00:16.66]
[00:21.87]Away from here to another land.
[00:27.04]Oh, this land in which we live,
[00:33.12]Where people love and are meant to forgive.
[00:39.74]
[00:41.55]And you always put me wrong,
[00:45.20]'Cause you're always putting me down.
[00:52.35]
[00:53.33]I can't take this anymore.
[00:58.54]I decided to leave,
[01:05.03]Walked out through the door.
[01:13.01]Oh, and why do you think I go?
[01:15.96]Because you know it can never be so.

[01:34.85]
[01:58.56]So let me take you by the hand,
[02:00.69]Away from here to another land.
[02:07.66]Oh, this land in which we live,
[02:14.50]Where people love and are meant to forgive.
[02:22.51]
[02:25.58]And you always put me wrong,
[02:29.92]'Cause you're always putting me down.
[02:32.79]
[02:36.60]La, la la la, la la la...
