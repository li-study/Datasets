[00:04.68]Ooooh
[00:10.75]I feel these four walls closing in
[00:14.01]Face up against the glass
[00:15.81]I'm looking out, hmmm
[00:18.04]Is this my life I'm wondering
[00:21.05]It happened so fast
[00:22.76]How do I turn this thing around
[00:25.19]Is this the bed I chose to make
[00:28.27]It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
[00:31.28]Hmm, wide open spaces far away
[00:38.91]All I want is the wind in my hair
[00:42.32]To face the fear but not feel scared
[00:47.79]Ooh, wild horses I wanna be like you
[00:54.51]Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
[01:01.41]Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
[01:08.51]I wanna run with the wild horses
[01:12.27]Run with the wild horses, oh
[01:16.86]Yeah, oh oh, ye-yeah
[01:24.14]I see the girl I wanna be
[01:27.41]Riding bare-back, care-free
[01:29.69]Along the shore
[01:31.30]If only that someone was me
[01:34.56]Jumping head-first, head-long
[01:36.83]Without a thought
[01:38.64]To act and down the consequence
[01:41.91]How I wish it could be that easy
[01:45.48]But fear surrounds me like a fence
[01:49.27]I wanna break free
[01:52.36]All I want is the wind in my hair
[01:55.76]To face the fear, but not feel scared
[01:59.68]Oooh, wild horses I wanna be like you
[02:07.72]Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
[02:15.26]Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
[02:22.49]I wanna run with the wild horses
[02:26.00]Run with the wild horses, oh
[02:36.37]I wanna run too
[02:40.74]Oooh oh oh oh
[02:44.83]Recklessly emboundening myself before you
[02:50.37]I wanna open up my heart
[02:54.47]Tell him how I feel, ooh ooh
[03:00.84]Oooh, wild horses I wanna be like you
[03:08.76]Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
[03:16.17]Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
[03:22.71]I wanna run with the wild horses
[03:26.82]Run with the wild horses
[03:30.69]Run with the wild horses
[03:34.17]Ooh ooooh ooh ooh ye-yeah yeah oohh
[03:44.72]I wanna run with the wild horses, ooooh
