[00:02.35]Early April Morning
[00:06.96]Brendan James
[00:10.41]The Day Is Brave
[00:13.86]There used to be nothing in common
[00:16.91]there used to be nothing to share
[00:20.32]It used to be sit by the window
[00:23.53]and stare at what used to be there
[00:27.02]It used to be lonely in numbers
[00:30.28]impossibly weak on my feet
[00:33.54]When the game starts and one person’s left out
[00:37.19]it used to be me
[00:40.99]But that was then and she is now
[00:44.48]I once was lost with her I’m found
[00:48.53]on this early April morning
[00:54.49]Water falling from the sky
[00:57.86]the sun that’s breaking fills my eye
[01:01.80]and it came without a warning now
[01:07.72]
[01:20.08]There used to be nothing in common
[01:23.65]there used to be nothing to share
[01:27.06]It used to be sit by the window
[01:30.22]and stare at what used to be there
[01:33.36]Like a king in his court at his table
[01:36.84]who is blind to the power he holds
[01:40.03]I could never come to understand all the powers I had of my own
[01:49.03]But that was then and she is now
[01:52.24]I once was lost with her I’m found
[01:56.24]on this early April morning
[02:02.19]Water falling from the sky
[02:05.52]the sun that’s breaking fills my eye
[02:09.48]and it came without a warning now
[02:14.69]
[02:28.16]I trust my love I trust myself
[02:32.30]I trust the love of someone else
[02:35.11]I trust that I will get what I’ve been hoping waiting for
[02:41.72]The prison walls are crashing down as winter dies without a sound
[02:49.11]on this early April Morning
[02:54.89]Let the struggle end the joy begin
[02:58.31]it’s true it’s love I’m falling in
[03:02.43]and it came without a warning now
[03:07.66]
[03:08.54]And that was then and she is now
[03:11.70]I once was lost with her I’m found
[03:15.75]on this early April morning
[03:21.67]The water falling from the sky
[03:25.10]the sun that’s breaking fills my eye
[03:29.02]and it came without a warning now
