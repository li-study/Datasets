[03:14.41][02:41.71][02:09.02][02:00.96][01:36.75][01:13.38][01:06.23][00:48.00][00:38.33][00:13.83]
[00:14.66]Far, away from it all
[00:20.66]You and me with no one else around
[00:25.81]A brand new start
[00:29.01]Is all we need, it\'s all we need
[00:31.67]to mend these hearts
[00:36.09]Back to the beginning
[02:01.65][01:06.63][00:39.54]Be still
[00:44.75]Let it go
[00:52.96]Before we lost hope
[00:59.32]When we still touched and
[01:03.38]love wasn\'t so hard
[01:10.43]I already know
[02:14.61][01:16.82]Foolish one with the smile
[02:17.67][01:18.35]You don\'t have to be brave
[02:27.66][01:21.91]Every time we fall down
[02:30.55][01:26.05]But we\'re falling from grace
[02:20.83][01:29.37]I\'ll gladly climb your walls
[01:32.88]if you\'ll meet me halfway
[01:42.58]Slow, slow it down
[01:49.17]Why do we run, we\'re
[01:50.52]missing so much babe
[01:53.53]Just lay in my arms for a while
[02:06.23]We should\'ve known
[02:24.09]If you\'ll meet me halfway
[02:34.15]Here\'s my hand and my heart
[02:37.24]It\'s yours to take
[02:47.02]Be still, be still, be still.......
[03:01.00]Be still.... be still...
