[01:12.16]Welcome to where time stands still
[01:14.50]No one leaves and no one will
[01:18.38]Moon is full, never seems to change
[01:20.79]Just labeled mentally deranged
[01:24.61]Dream the same thing every night
[01:27.14]I see our freedom in my sight
[01:30.97]No locked doors, No windows barred
[01:33.54]No things to make my brain seem scarred
[01:37.36]Sleep my friend and you will see
[01:39.76]That dream is my reality
[01:43.48]They keep me locked up in this cage
[01:45.89]Cant they see its why my brain says Rage
[01:53.16]
[01:53.39]Sanitarium, leave me be
[02:02.71]Sanitarium, just leave me alone
[02:09.96]
[02:36.68]Build my fear of whats out there
[02:39.25]And cannot breathe the open air
[02:43.04]Whisper things into my brain
[02:45.58]Assuring me that Im insane
[02:49.39]They think our heads are in their hands
[02:51.86]But violent use brings violent plans
[02:55.75]Keep him tied, it makes him well
[02:58.31]Hes getting better, cant you tell?
[03:02.15]No more can they keep us in
[03:04.55]Listen, damn it, we will win
[03:08.30]They see it right, they see it well
[03:10.54]But they think this saves us from our Hell
[03:17.61]
[03:18.07]Sanitarium, leave me be
[03:27.33]Sanitarium, just leave me alone
[03:37.51]Sanitarium, just leave me alone
[03:46.13]
[04:07.74]Fear of living on
[04:09.93]Natives getting restless now
[04:12.11]Mutiny in the air
[04:14.86]Got some death to do
[04:16.51]Mirror stares back hard
[04:18.67]Kill, its such a friendly word
[04:20.91]Seems the only way
[04:23.39]For reaching out again
