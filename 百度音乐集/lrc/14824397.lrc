[00:10.90]Band On The Run
[00:37.67]Stuck inside these four walls
[00:43.43]Sent inside forever
[00:49.33]Never seeing no one nice again
[01:00.17]Like you, mama, you, mama, you
[01:15.52]
[01:48.16]If I ever get out of here
[01:51.02]Thought of giving it all away
[01:53.83]To a registered charity
[01:56.92]All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
[02:02.00]If we ever get out of here
[02:04.64]
[02:21.58]Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
[02:25.34]As we fell into the sun
[02:29.02]And the first one said to be the second one there
[02:33.34]I hope you’re having fun
[02:36.67]
[02:37.07]Band on the run, band on the run
[02:44.41]And the jailer man and sailor Sam
[02:48.19]Were searching everyone
[02:51.36]For the band on the run, band on the run
[02:59.72]Band on the run, band on the run
[03:06.06]
[03:07.22]Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
[03:10.99]Seeing no one else had come
[03:14.59]And a bell was ringing in the village square
[03:18.84]For the rabbit on the run
[03:22.52]
[03:23.00]Band on the run, band on the run
[03:30.29]And the jailer man and sailor Sam
[03:34.20]Were searching everyone
[03:37.34]For the band on the run, band on the run
[03:43.87]
[03:59.51]Yeah the band on the run, the band on the run
[04:07.08]Band on the run, band on the run
[04:12.88]
[04:14.48]Well, the night was falling as a desert world
[04:18.53]Began the settle down
[04:22.28]In the town they’re searching for us everywhere
[04:26.05]But we never will be fund
[04:30.28]
[04:30.69]Band on the run, band on the run
[04:37.73]And the county judge who held a grudge
[04:45.64]Will search for evermore
[04:48.69]For the band on the run, the band on the run
[04:57.56]Band on the run, band on the run
[05:05.16]
