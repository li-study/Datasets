[03:58.27][03:30.73][03:04.90][02:38.54][01:45.70][01:19.37][00:53.10][00:25.18][00:-1.00]
[00:00.50]Sailboats wish that they were stars
[00:05.47]Floating softly in the sky
[00:09.59]Among our dreams that bid goodbye
[00:13.79]Moving through transparent space
[00:18.38]Drifting through the stratosphere
[00:22.12]And onward 'till they disappear
[00:25.98]These continents, from overhead
[00:30.96]Look like tiny paper shapes
[00:34.87]Intricately set in place
[00:39.14]Below the misty mountain clouds
[00:43.72]There's a lovely silver bay
[00:47.68]Where sunset sailors often hide away
[00:54.80]Scooba diver in the lock
[01:00.63]Speedboat driver in the dock
[01:07.88]Sailplane pilot in the blue, take me up there with you
[01:14.28]The world looks brighter from this high altitude
[01:20.54]I was walking through the trees
[03:09.78][01:23.91](Sailboats wish that they were stars)
[01:27.09]And I was swimming through the sees
[03:16.04][01:30.54]('Cause they don't know who they are)
[01:33.59]I was falling through the air
[01:36.95]When it hit me right there
[01:39.76]My eyes are tired
[01:41.99]I don't even care
[02:10.62]An airplane carred me to bed
[02:16.92]Where I slept above the coast
[02:20.66]and dreamt I had become a ghost
[02:24.98]I sail above the frozen peaks
[02:29.75]Deep in cold cathedral caves
[02:33.47]Across the hills and far beyond the waves
[02:40.67]Take the car on the run
[02:46.64]Fly the jet to the sun
[02:53.21]And bring the spacecraft in soon
[02:56.41]While I play chess with the moon
[02:59.79]I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon
[03:06.57]Once in 1964
[03:12.80]An actress ran on the shore
[03:19.02]And though you'll never return
[03:22.54]I love you, Audrey Hepburn
[03:25.60]Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd
[03:31.64]There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky
[03:38.51]But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly
[03:44.91]I'm glad the Earth doesn't care If I go up there
[03:51.12]If you want to, just ask me and I'll take you along
