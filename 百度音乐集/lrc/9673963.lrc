[00:36.45]When they call your name
[00:41.34]Will you walk right up?
[00:44.27]With a smile on your face?
[00:48.12]Or will you cower in fear
[00:57.00]In your favorite sweater
[01:00.19]With an old love letter?
[01:08.73]I wish you would
[01:15.62]I wish you would
[01:21.05]Come pick me up
[01:25.19]Take me out
[01:28.74]Fuck me up
[01:32.82]Steal my records
[01:36.66]Screw all my friends
[01:39.85]They're all full of shit
[01:43.93]With a smile on your face
[01:47.36]And then do it again
[01:56.02]I wish you would
[02:15.48]When you're walking downtown
[02:20.09]Do you wish I was there?
[02:22.70]Do you wish it was me?
[02:31.64]With the windows clear and the mannequins eyes
[02:34.22]Do they all look like mine?
[02:45.86]You know you could
[02:53.48]I wish you would
[02:59.71]Come pick me up
[03:02.82]Take me out
[03:06.58]Fuck me up
[03:10.34]Steal my records
[03:14.04]Screw all my friends behind my back
[03:18.19]With a smile on your face
[03:26.08]And then do it again
[03:33.22]I wish you would
[04:09.59]I wish you'd make up my bed
[04:14.36]So I could make up my mind
[04:22.44]Try it for sleeping instead
[04:28.98]Maybe you'll rest sometime
[04:38.57]I wish I could
