[00:00.14]Cher
[00:00.15]
[00:00.19]I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
[00:08.56]I swear like the shadow that's by your side
[00:16.51]
[00:19.17]I see the questions in your eyes
[00:24.50]I know what's weighing on your mind
[00:30.01]You can be sure I know my heart
[00:36.46]And I'll stand beside you through the years
[00:43.99]You'll only cry those happy tears
[00:49.45]And though I make mistakes
[00:53.60]I'll never break your heart
[00:58.54]I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
[01:07.14]I'll be there
[01:09.84]I swear like a shadow that's by your side
[01:18.28]I'll be there
[01:21.90]For better or worse till death do us part
[01:27.60]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[01:33.31]And I swear
[01:41.33]
[01:46.30]I'll give you every thing I can
[01:52.34]I'll build your dreams with these two hands
[01:57.92]We'll hang some memories on the walls
[02:04.34]And when just the two of us are there
[02:11.91]You won't have to ask if I still care
[02:17.69]Casue as the time turns the page
[02:21.61]My love won't age at all
[02:27.28]I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
[02:35.50]I'll be there
[02:38.62]I swear like the shadow that's by your side
[02:47.21]I'll be there
[02:50.83]For better or worse till death do us part
[02:56.65]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[03:02.62]And I swear
[03:10.38]
[03:16.20]I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
[03:24.88]I'll be there  I'll be there
[03:28.34]I swear like the shadow that's by your side
[03:36.43]I'll be there
[03:40.23]For better or worse till death do us part
[03:46.06]I'll love you with every beat of my heart
[03:53.09]And I swear
[03:56.81]
[03:57.15]And I swear
[04:04.06]
[04:04.67]I swear
[04:14.49]
