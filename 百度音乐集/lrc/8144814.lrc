[ti:If you love somebody, set them free]
[ar:Sting]

[00:03.54]If you need somebody, call my name
[00:22.62]If you want someone, you can do the same
[00:28.82]If you want to keep something precious
[00:32.03]You got to lock it up and throw away the key
[00:36.86]If you want to hold onto your possession
[00:40.31]Don't even think about me
[00:44.44]If you love somebody, set them free
[01:16.11]If it's a mirror you want, just look into my eyes
[01:22.43]Or a whipping boy, someone to despise
[01:31.31]Or a prisoner in the dark
[01:35.36]Tied up in chains you just can't see
[01:38.25]Or a beast in a gilded cage
[01:42.16]That's all some people ever want to be
[01:46.69]If you love somebody, set them free
[02:11.24]You can't control an independent heart
[02:24.07]Can't tear the one you love apart
[02:33.22]Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
[02:37.63]We can't live here and be happy with less
[02:40.48]So many riches, so many souls
[02:44.22]Everything we see we want to possess
[02:47.73]If you need somebody, call my name
[02:53.75]If you want someone, you can do the same
[03:03.01]If you want to keep something precious
[03:06.30]You got to lock it up and throw away the key
[03:10.66]If you want to hold onto your possession
[03:14.41]Don't even think about me
[03:18.33]If you love somebody, set them free
