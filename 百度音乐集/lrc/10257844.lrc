[00:18.97]Well here I sit, gettin' ideas
[00:22.22]Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
[00:24.96]Out all night and runnin' wild
[00:27.40]Woman sittin' home with a month old child
[00:30.28]Dang me, dang me
[00:32.49]They oughta take a rope and hang me
[00:35.13]High from the highest tree
[00:37.91]Woman would you weep for me.

[00:48.90]Just sittin' around drinkin' with the rest of the guys
[00:52.05]Six rounds bought, and I bought five
[00:54.39]Spent the groceries and half the rent
[00:57.12]Like fourteen dollars and twenty seven cents.
[00:59.59]Dang me, dang me
[01:01.67]They oughta take a rope and hang me

[01:07.25]Woman would you weep for me.

[01:23.95]Well I'm the seventh out of seven sons
[01:26.49]My pappy was a pistol
[01:29.21]I'm a son of a gun.
[01:29.37]Dang me, dang me
[01:31.43]They oughta take a rope and hang me
[01:33.95]High from the highest tree
[01:37.18]Woman would you weep for me.
