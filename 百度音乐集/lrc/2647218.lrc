[00:15]Disarm you with a smile
[00:18]And cut you like you want me to
[00:23]Cut that little child
[00:26]Inside of me and such a part of you
[00:38][00:31]Ooh, the years burn
[02:11][00:49]I used to be a little boy
[02:15][00:53]So old in my shoes
[01:00]And what I choose is my choice
[02:22][01:04]What's a boy supposed to do?
[02:52][02:44][02:37][02:27][01:12]The killer in me is the killer in you
[02:30][01:16]My love
[02:55][02:48][02:41][02:33][01:19]I send this smile over to you
[01:37]Disarm you with a smile
[01:40]And leave you like they left me here
[01:44]To wither in denial
[01:47]The bitterness of one who's left alone
[01:52]Ooh, the years burn
[02:00]Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
[02:19]And what I choose is my voice
[02:37]The killer in me is the killer in you
[02:41]Send this smile over to you
[02:44]The killer in me is the killer in you
[02:48]Send this smile over to you
[02:52]The killer in me is the killer in you
[02:55]Send this smile over to you
