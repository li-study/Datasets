[00:00.85]Lazy
[00:11.74]Here they come with their make-up on
[00:15.28]as lovely as the clouds, come and see them,
[00:20.33]Boys and girls and their mums and their words
[00:23.70]and their romances and jobs and their sons,
[00:28.96]Barking mad kids, lonely dads
[00:32.50]who drug it up to give it some meaning,
[00:37.53]From the raves to the council estates
[00:40.83]they're reminding us there's things to be done.
[00:46.14]But you and me, all we want to be is lazy,
[00:54.73]you and me, so lazy...
[01:05.43]Here they come gone 7am
[01:08.73]getting satellite and Sky getting cable,
[01:14.05]Bills and Bens and their mums and their friends
[01:17.39]who just really, really want to be loved,
[01:22.78]Uncle Teds and their legendary vests
[01:26.34]helping out around the disabled,
[01:31.30]From the flats and the maisonettes
[01:34.58]they're reminding us there's things to be done.
[02:34.35][02:17.04][01:39.91]But you and me, all we want to be is lazy,
[02:42.96][02:25.68][01:48.50]you and me, so lazy...
[02:51.62]It's you and me, it's you and me, you and me...
