[00:18.00]You'll remember me when the west wind moves
[00:23.00]Upon the fields of barley
[00:27.00]You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
[00:32.00]As we walk in fields of gold
[00:42.00]
[00:43.00]So she took her love
[00:46.00]For to gaze awhile
[00:48.00]Upon the fields of barley
[00:53.00]In his arms she fell as her hair came down
[00:57.00]Among the fields of gold
[01:02.00]Will you stay with me, will you be my love
[01:07.00]Among the fields of barley
[01:11.00]We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
[01:15.00]As we lie in fields of gold
[01:26.00]
[01:27.00]See the west wind move like a lover so
[01:32.00]Upon the fields of barley
[01:36.00]Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
[01:41.00]Among the fields of gold
[01:46.00]
[01:47.00]I never made promises lightly
[01:52.00]And there have been some that I've broken
[01:56.00]But I swear in the days still left
[01:59.00]We'll walk in fields of gold
[02:04.00]We'll walk in fields of gold
[02:27.00]
[02:29.00]Many years have passed since those summer days
[02:34.00]Among the fields of barley
[02:38.00]See the children run as the sun goes down
[02:43.00]Among the fields of gold
[02:48.00]You'll remember me when the west wind moves
[02:53.00]Upon the fields of barley
[02:57.00]You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
[03:02.00]When we walked in fields of gold
[03:06.00]When we walked in fields of gold
[03:11.46]When we walked in fields of gold
