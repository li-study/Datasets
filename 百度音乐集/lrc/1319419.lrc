[00:08.89]Uptown girl
[00:11.22]She's been living in her uptown world
[00:14.67]I bet she never had a back street guy
[00:18.40]I bet her mama never told her why
[00:22.03]I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
[00:25.71]She's been living in her white bread world
[00:29.36]As long as anyone with hot blood can
[00:33.11]And now she's looking for a downtown man
[00:36.79]That's what I am
[00:39.01]And when she knows what
[00:41.76]She wants from her time
[00:46.40]And when she wakes up
[00:49.19]And makes up her mind
[00:53.73]She'll see I'm not so tough
[00:56.90]Just because
[00:58.89]I'm in love with an uptown girl
[01:02.68]You know I've seen her in her uptown world
[01:06.53]She's getting tired of her high class toys
[01:10.26]And all her presents from her uptown boys
[01:13.92]She's got a choice
[01:18.38]

[01:30.46]Uptown girl
[01:32.55]You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
[01:35.98]But maybe someday when my ship comes in
[01:39.72]She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
[01:43.42]And then I'll win
[01:45.94]And when she's walking
[01:48.50]She's looking so fine
[01:53.11]And when she's talking
[01:55.88]She'll say that she's mine
[02:00.30]She'll say I'm not so tough
[02:04.12]Just because
[02:05.61]I'm in love
[02:06.95]With an uptown girl
[02:09.56]She's been living in her white bread world
[02:13.22]As long as anyone with hot blood can
[02:16.79]And now she's looking for a downtown man
[02:20.55]That's what I am
[02:22.86]Uptown girl
[02:25.23]She's my uptown girl
[02:28.56]You know I'm in love
[02:29.90]With an uptown girl
[02:32.42]My uptown girl
[02:35.99]You know I'm in love
[02:37.29]With an uptown girl
[02:40.13]My uptown girl
[02:43.45]You know I'm in love
[02:45.17]With an uptown girl
