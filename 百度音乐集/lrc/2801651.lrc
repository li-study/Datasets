[00:35.58]I will be walking one day
[00:42.59]Down a street far away
[00:48.11]And see a face in the crowd and smile
[00:58.65]Knowing how you made me laugh
[01:02.85]Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
[01:10.17]I will remember you.
[01:24.02]Look in my eyes while you're near
[01:30.74]Tell me what's happening here
[01:36.04]See that I don't want to say good-bye
[01:46.85]Our love is frozen in time
[01:52.28]I'll be your champion and you will be mine
[01:59.73]I will remember
[02:05.52]I will remember you.
[02:19.37]Later on
[02:22.18]When this fire is an ember
[02:25.04]Later on
[02:27.51]When the night is not so tender
[02:30.40]Given time
[02:33.23]Though it's hard to remember darlin? I will be holding
[02:39.21]I'll still be holding to you
[02:54.35]I will remember you.
[03:03.21]So many years come and gone
[03:07.85]And yet the memory is strong
[03:13.26]One word we never could learn
[03:18.19]Good-bye
[03:23.30]True love is frozen in time
[03:29.51]I'll be your champion and you'll be mine
[03:36.05]I will remember you
[03:48.23]So please remember
[03:53.63]I will remember you
[04:04.43]I will remember you
[04:15.06]I will remember you
[04:44.37]I will remember you.
