[ti:]Won't Get Fooled Again
[ar:]
[al:]The who

[00:44.56]We'll be fighting in the streets
[00:48.06]With our children at our feet
[00:51.56]And the morals that they worship will be gone
[00:58.73]The men who spurred us on
[01:02.18]Sit in judgment of all wrong
[01:05.87]They decide and the shotgun sings the song
[01:10.78]
[01:13.10]I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
[01:16.67]Take a bow for the new revolution
[01:20.27]Smile and grin at the change all around
[01:23.96]Pick up my guitar and play
[01:27.48]Just like yesterday
[01:30.78]Then I'll get on my knees and pray
[01:38.20]We don't get fooled again
[01:40.93]
[01:54.27]The change it had to come
[01:57.68]We knew it all along
[02:01.04]We were liberated from the fold that's all
[02:08.19]The world looks just the same
[02:11.72]And history ain't blamed
[02:15.36]'Cause the banners, they are flown in the last war
[02:20.48]
[02:22.56]I raise my hat to the new constitution
[02:26.07]Take a bow for the new revolution
[02:29.63]Smile and grin at the change all around
[02:33.15]Pick up my guitar and play
[02:36.81]Just like yesterday
[02:40.18]Then I'll get on my knees and pray
[02:47.61]We don't get fooled again
[02:50.98]No, no!
[02:52.36]
[03:24.76]I'll move myself and my family aside
[03:28.94]If we happen to be left half alive
[03:32.04]Get all my papers and smile at the sky
[03:35.66]Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
[03:39.73]
[03:47.59]Do ya?
[03:48.45]
[04:36.13]There's nothing in the street
[04:39.11]Looks any different to me
[04:42.88]And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
[04:50.01]The parting on the left
[04:53.32]Is now parting on the right
[04:57.08]And the beards have all grown longer overnight
[05:01.59]
[05:04.41]I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
[05:08.01]Take a bow for the new revolution
[05:11.43]Smile and grin at the change all around
[05:15.15]Pick up my guitar and play
[05:18.73]Just like yesterday
[05:22.09]Then I'll get on my knees and pray
[05:29.35]We don't get fooled again
[05:33.31]Don't wanna get fooled again
[05:36.76]No, no!
[05:38.87]
[07:52.66]Meet the new boss
[07:56.02]Same as the old boss
[07:59.22]
