[00:09.21]
[00:10.67]by Rosette
[00:15.06]I told myself today was gonna be the day
[00:18.23]no more excuses 'cause i knew exactly what to say
[00:21.27]was gonna make my play but just like yesterday
[00:25.39]my mind erased,
[00:27.28]and i let the moment slip away
[00:28.94]another night got me sitting here all on my own
[00:32.32]picking up the phone
[00:33.73]but i cant get pass the dial tone
[00:35.89]racking my brain
[00:37.25]going insane
[00:38.59]again and again
[00:40.00]i can't keep going this way
[00:42.94]crushed,
[00:44.29]by the sweetest lips i've never kissed
[00:46.70]and your fingertips
[00:48.00]and the warmest touch that i've always missed
[00:49.83]crushed,
[00:52.55]by the softest hands i've never held
[00:55.37]probably never tell,
[00:55.73]you're the strongest love that i've ever felt
[00:57.10]crushed,
[00:59.99]that i haven't ever let you know
[01:00.84]how it always goes
[01:02.26]'cause i lose my nerve whenever you get close
[01:04.44]and so i'm left,
[01:05.78]short of breath
[01:07.41]with that heavy feeling in my chest
[01:09.19]baby im so crushed
[01:12.67]

[01:18.41]and i keep on telling myself that i'm gonna find a way
[01:21.49]and i wont be afraid just like yesterday
[01:25.19]won't walk away
[01:27.48]never gonna let another chance slip away
[01:28.86]'cause i gotta know which ever way its gonna go
