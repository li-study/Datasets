[00:04.12]Title: Surrender
[00:05.83]
[00:08.88]No more wars to fight
[00:12.60]White flags fly tonight
[00:17.31]You are out of danger now
[00:25.58]Battle field is still
[00:29.38]Wild poppies on the hill
[00:34.29]Peace can only come
[00:37.75]when you surrender
[00:41.80]
[00:43.11]Here the tracers fly
[00:46.52]Lighting up the sky
[00:50.52]But I'll fight unto the end
[00:58.74]Let them send their armies
[01:03.05]I will never bend
[01:07.12]I won't see you now
[01:10.67]till I surrender
[01:15.48]I'll see you again
[01:19.49]when I surrender
[01:23.75]
[01:40.68]Battle field is still
[01:43.64]Wild poppies on the hill
[01:48.40]Peace can only come
[01:52.10]when you surrender
[01:55.41]
[01:57.26]Here the tracers fly
[02:00.88]Lighting up the sky
[02:04.78]But I'll fight unto the end
[02:12.74]Let them send their armies
[02:17.05]I will never bend
[02:21.16]I won't see you now
[02:24.92]till I surrender
[02:30.88]I'll see you again
[02:34.44]when I surrender
[02:45.47]
