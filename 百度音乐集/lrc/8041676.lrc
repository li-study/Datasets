[00:06.00]豆豆，我们相爱一年了，OH YEAH我记得，亲爱的，记得 你那柔发的闪光
[00:30.62]There may be trouble ahead
[00:38.74]But while there\'s music and moonlight and love and romance
[00:49.90]Let\'s face the music and dance
[00:57.58]Before the fiddlers have fled
[01:04.92]Before they ask us to pay the bill
[01:10.60]and while we still have the chance
[01:19.35]Let\'s face the music and dance
[01:25.85]Soon we\'ll be without the moon
[01:32.11]humming a different tune and then
[01:41.61]There may be teardrops to shed
[01:49.33]So while there\'s moonlight and music and love and romance
[02:00.75]Let\'s face the music and dance
[02:05.97]
[03:01.42]Soon we\'ll be without the moon
[03:08.07]humming a different tune and then
[03:17.58]There may be teardrops to shed
[03:24.74]So while there\'s moonlight and music and love and romance
[03:36.22]Let\'s face the music and dance
[03:42.96]
[03:53.61]Let\'s face the music and dance
[04:01.54]
[04:15.57]Let\'s face the music and dance
[04:36.86]Let\'s face the music and dance
[04:45.35]
[04:58.69]Let\'s face the music and dance
