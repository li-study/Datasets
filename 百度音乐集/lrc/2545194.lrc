[00:03.61]Sometimes late at night
[00:08.58]I lie awake and watch her sleeping
[00:16.69]She's lost in peaceful dreams
[00:19.37]So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
[00:27.38]And the thought crosses my mind
[00:32.69]If I never wake up in the morning
[00:38.75]Would she ever doubt the way I feel
[00:45.70]About her in my heart
[00:51.27]If tomorrow never comes
[00:57.50]Will she know how much I loved her
[01:03.46]Did I try in every way to show her every day
[01:09.50]That she's my only one
[01:15.47]And if my time on earth were through
[01:21.46]And she must face the world without me
[01:27.30]Is the love I gave her in the past
[01:30.83]Gonna be enough to last
[01:33.75]If tomorrow never comes
[01:36.85]
[01:39.45]'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
[01:45.09]Who never knew how much I loved them
[01:51.54]Now I live with the regret
[01:55.61]That my true feelings for them never were revealed
[02:03.15]So I made a promise to myself
[02:09.25]To say each day how much she means to me
[02:16.14]And avoid that circumstance
[02:19.63]Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
[02:27.81]If tomorrow never comes
[02:33.57]Will she know how much I loved her
[02:39.65]Did I try in every way to show her every day
[02:45.98]That she's my only one
[02:52.03]And if my time on earth were through
[02:57.96]And she must face the world without me
[03:03.87]Is the love I gave her in the past
[03:07.18]Gonna be enough to last
[03:10.40]If tomorrow never comes
[03:16.21]So tell that someone that you love
[03:19.93]Just what you're thinking of
[03:22.74]If tomorrow never comes
