[00:19.80]If I had another chance tonight
[00:29.07]I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
[00:38.04]Time can't erase the love we shared
[00:43.97]But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
[00:54.56]
[00:56.91]Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
[01:06.35]I guess I have myself to blame
[01:15.55]Time can't erase the things we said
[01:21.46]But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who said
[01:32.29]
[01:33.99]You know I won't hold you back now
[01:43.37]The love we had just can't be found
[01:52.98]You know I can't hold you back now
[02:00.63]
[02:07.33]Now that I'm alone it gives me time
[02:16.32]To think about the years that you were mine
[02:26.05]Time can erase the love we shared
[02:32.27]But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
[02:42.69]
[02:44.86]You know I won't hold you back now
[02:54.04]The love we had just can't be found
[03:03.26]You know I can't hold you back now
[03:10.37]
[03:17.88]Mmmmm.....Mmmmmm...
[03:36.72]Aaaaah.....Aaaaaah...
[03:53.94]
[03:55.34]You know I won't hold you back now
[04:04.69]The love we had just can't be found
[04:14.02]You know I can't hold you back now
[04:23.31]The love we had just can't be found
[04:33.17]You know I won't hold you back now
