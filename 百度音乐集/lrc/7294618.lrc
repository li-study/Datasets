[00:05.75]
[00:08.50]I've spent all my life, on a search to find
[00:17.09]The love who'll stay for eternity
[00:21.29]The heaven sent out fulfill my needs
[00:24.79]But when I turn around
[00:28.34]Again, love has knocked me down
[00:33.23]And my heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
[00:37.11]I'm sad to say, love wins again
[00:40.96]So I placed my heart under lock and key
[00:45.27]To take some time, and take care of me
[00:49.00]But I turn around and you're standing here
[00:54.48]How did you get here?
[01:00.35]Nobody's supposed to be here
[01:05.18]I've tried that love thing for the last time
[01:10.45]My heart says no, no!
[01:16.30]Nobody's supposed to be hereBut
[01:21.17]you came along and changed my mind
[01:28.73]This time I swear I'm through
[01:32.76]But if only you knew
[01:37.23]How many times I've said those words
[01:41.77]Then fall again, will I ever learn
[01:44.85]Knowing these tears I cry
[01:48.21]This lovely black butterfly
[01:52.82]Must take a chance, and spread my wings
[01:57.01]Love can make you do some crazy things
[02:00.94]So I placed my heart under lock and key
[02:05.31]To take some time, and take care of me
[02:09.03]But I turn around and you're standing here
[02:23.35]no, no! Nobody no, no no, no no, no
[02:28.98]
[02:38.01]How did you get here?
[02:43.35]Nobody's supposed to be here
[02:47.96]I've tried that love thing for the last time
[02:53.14]My heart says no, no!
[02:58.37]Nobody's supposed to be hereBut
[03:02.87]you came along and changed my mind
[03:07.79]How did you get here?
[03:13.28]Nobody's supposed to be here
[03:17.89]I've tried that love thing for the last time
[03:23.01]My heart says no, no!
[03:28.42]Nobody's supposed to be hereBut
[03:32.98]you came along and changed my mind
[03:40.91]
