[00:12.57]
[00:14.40]I turn around, I see your face,
[00:17.78]my head is just an empty space,
[00:21.00]Your kisses fade without a trace,
[00:24.43]Ooh I'll never get over you,
[00:28.49]Precious moments we were one,
[00:31.52]But you're life's changed n' you've moved on,
[00:35.00]Thinkin' about you everyday,
[00:38.39]Ooh I'll never get over you
[00:42.33]
[00:42.98]I need to feel you once again,
[00:49.80]Close to me remember when,
[00:54.34]
[03:01.20][02:05.30][00:56.06]My heart is restless like the wind,
[03:04.47][02:08.91][00:59.23]I'm missin' something from within,
[03:07.92][02:12.24][01:02.53]Until you bring it back again,

[03:35.90][02:25.86][01:16.71]Never get over, Never get over you
[02:30.66][01:21.04]
[01:23.87]I don't believe I made you leave,
[01:27.04]When you are strong and I'm naive,
[01:30.68]The feelings gone n' now you're free but me ,
[01:35.52]I'll never get over you,
[01:38.07]Need some time to find my way waitin' for that brighter day,
[01:44.88]Let my love just fade away,
[01:47.91]Ooh n' then I'll get over you
[01:51.98]
[01:52.62]Time has come I realise,
[01:59.12]I shouldn't need you in my life
[02:04.51]

[02:42.34]
[02:47.18]I need to feel you once again,
[02:54.98]Close to me remember when,
[02:59.35]
[03:15.20]My heart is restless like the wind,
[03:18.40]I'm missin' something from within,
[03:21.92]Until you bring it back again,
