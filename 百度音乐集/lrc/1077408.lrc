[00:10.66]
[00:14.35]The day I was leaving
[00:17.42]I was feeling insecure
[00:20.78]I thought that I'd thrown away
[00:22.73]All of those days
[00:24.89]And what we had before
[00:28.56]And now I believe it
[00:31.62]After what you had to say
[00:34.65]I thought about every day
[00:36.88]In every way
[00:38.77]And this is what I'll say now baby
[00:42.18]
[00:43.20]You don't have to worry
[00:46.10]Cause everything's all right
[00:49.46]I know that you'll get me
[00:52.68]That you'll get me through the night
[00:55.69]
[00:56.38]When you come around
[00:59.99]You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down
[01:03.73]And I want you to know
[01:05.31]Baby how can I show
[01:07.08]Do I have to scream and shout
[01:10.66]When you come around
[01:14.22]You only have to smile and you knock me out
[01:17.75]But I'm here on the floor
[01:19.57]And I'm begging for more
[01:21.41]Baby that's what love's about
[01:24.21]
[01:27.72]There's so many reasons
[01:30.24]Why our love is guaranteed
[01:33.52]So many reasons why
[01:35.57]I can't hide
[01:37.48]Just what you mean to me
[01:41.90]So say what you're thinking
[01:44.38]While you're sitting next to me
[01:47.54]Let all your feelings show
[01:49.89]Just let me know
[01:51.77]Just how it's meant to be now baby
[01:55.18]
[01:55.93]You don't have to worry
[01:58.90]Cause everything's all right
[02:02.37]I know that you'll get me
[02:05.76]That you'll get me through the night
[02:08.78]

[02:12.55]You know you pick me up when I'm feeling down
[02:16.47]And I want you to know
[02:18.25]Baby how can I show
[02:20.01]Do I have to scream and shout

[02:30.69]But I'm here on the floor
[02:32.47]And I'm begging for more
