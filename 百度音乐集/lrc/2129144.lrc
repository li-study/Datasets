[00:-15.50]Don`t Sail Away
[00:-10.55]演唱：张惠妹
[00:-02.71]

[00:00.15]alone
[00:04.39]On a sailboat lost at sea
[00:08.63]I did not recognize the skies above me
[00:16.29]My compass was just spinning round and round
[00:22.64]It was just spinning round
[00:25.83]
[00:32.30]And then with a gust of wind things changed
[00:40.34]Set off one course that seemed to me quite strange
[00:47.79]I was heading through the air straight for the the monn
[00:54.21]Straight for the the monn
[00:57.56]
[00:59.98]And when I landed
[01:03.79]He took my hand
[01:07.49]We dinedang we danced with the stars
[01:13.91]
[01:14.95]He asked me to stay in this dreamland
[01:21.73]But the wind called out so I went instead
[01:26.33]Then he turned to me and said
[01:29.50]
[01:30.54]Don`t sail away
[01:34.29]Don`t sail away from me
[01:38.04]Don`t sail away
[01:41.42]We could have such a lovely time
[01:44.63]
[01:45.53]Don`t sail away
[01:49.28]Don`t sail away from me
[01:53.08]Don`t sail away
[01:56.47]You could stay and just be mine
[01:58.88]I told him not this time
[02:01.74]
[02:08.21]The wind carried me across deep spaces
[02:16.49]I visited many times and many places
[02:24.15]I drived until my boat can to a stop
[02:30.50]On destiny`s roof top
[02:34.30]
[03:10.53]In side
[03:14.95]I played chess with destiny
[03:19.10]I saw a way to win so very easily
[03:25.07]
[03:26.31]But he was taking far too long to make his move
[03:33.12]Destiny wouldn`t move
[03:36.07]
[03:38.43]So I turned my boat
[03:42.00]Back towards that dreamland
[03:46.16]And I filled the sails with my breath
[03:52.31]
[03:54.63]When I landed
[03:57.63]He took my hand
[04:00.35]Though the wind called out I remained instead
[04:04.68]
[04:05.05]He still turned to me and said
[04:09.38]Don`t sail away
[04:13.12]Don`t sail away from me
[04:16.84]Don`t sail away
[04:20.26]We could have such a lovely time
[04:23.51]
[04:24.42]Don`t sail away
[04:28.14]Don`t sail away from me
[04:31.83]Don`t sail away
[04:35.16]You could stay and just be mine
[04:37.74]I like to stay for a life time
[04:39.57]Don`t sail away
[04:43.61]Don`t sail away
[04:44.74]I like to stay
[04:47.38]Don`t sail away
[04:51.12] could have such a lovely time
[04:55.08]Don`t sail away
[04:58.96]Don`t sail away
[05:03.08]Don`t sail away
[05:06.73]could stay and just be mine
[05:10.02]
