[00:00.58]You like a storm against the window
[00:05.53]Follow me around just like a shadow
[00:10.39]I swim the never ending ocean
[00:15.35]Until you bring back your devotion
[00:20.44]It's like I live a thousand lifetime
[00:25.11]Still looking for the one that feels like
[00:30.09]See moving on just isn't working
[00:35.12]You left a fire here that I'll burn in
[00:39.23]And all I've been doing is forget it?
[00:44.01]A life for the sake of my pride
[00:47.51]Follow the others had me thinking
[00:52.34]We could be more than just amazing
[00:57.31]I guess I'm holding on to my thing

[01:11.92]We could be more than just amazing
[01:15.85]And all I've been doing is forget it?
[01:21.02]A life for the sake of my pride

[01:29.24]We could be more than just amazing
[01:34.26]I couldn't see it
[01:36.14]I must have believed a lie
[01:39.11]If I had made it
[01:40.65]Would you let me make it right
[01:47.65]Is it all wrong
[01:51.78]Oh no
[01:54.17]Say all

[02:18.42]We could be more than just amazing
[02:22.92]And all I've been doing is forget it?
[02:27.56]A life for the sake of my pride
