[00:13.71]Yeah, Oh
[00:19.12]I stare at your face
[00:22.82]Into your eyes
[00:25.41]Outside there's so much passing us by
[00:29.99]All of the sounds
[00:32.61]All of the sights
[00:34.96]Over the earth and under the sky
[00:39.61]Too much cold and too much rain
[00:44.06]Too much heartache to explain
