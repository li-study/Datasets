[00:04.00]Massachusetts
[00:06.00]Bee Gees
[00:09.00]Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,
[00:19.00]Something's telling me I must go home.
[01:41.00][01:04.00][00:27.00]And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
[00:36.00]The day I left her standing on her own.
[00:46.00]Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,
[00:56.00]Gotta do the things I wanna do.
[01:13.00]They brought me back to see my way with you.
[01:24.00]Talk about the life in Massachusetts,
[01:33.00]Speak about the people I have seen,
[01:51.00]And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
[02:13.00][02:03.00]I will remember Massachusetts...
