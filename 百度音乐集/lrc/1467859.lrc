[ti:Father and son]

[al:Every day I love you]

[00:06.00]
[00:12.00]It's not time to make a change
[00:16.00]Just relax--take it easy
[00:19.00]You're still young--that's your fault
[00:23.00]There's so much you have to know
[00:26.00]Find a girl, settle down
[00:29.00]If you want, you can marry
[00:33.00]Look at me--I am old
[00:36.00]But I'm happy
[00:38.00]
[00:39.00]I was once like you are now
[00:43.00]And I know that it's not easy
[00:46.00]To become when you've found
[00:49.00]Something going on
[00:52.00]But take your time--think a lot
[00:56.00]Think of everthing you've got
[00:59.00]For you will still be here tomorrow
[01:02.00]But your dreams may not...
[01:05.00]
[01:10.00]How can I try to explain?
[01:13.00]When I do--it turns away again
[01:17.00]And it's always been the same
[01:20.00]Same old story
[01:23.00]From the moment I could talk
[01:26.00]I was ordered to listen
[01:29.00]Now there's a way, and I know
[01:33.00]That I have to go away
[01:36.00]I know, I have to go...
[01:41.00]
[01:45.00]It's not time to make a change
[01:48.00]Just sit down
[01:50.00]and take it slowly
[01:52.00]You're still young--that's your fault
[01:55.00]There's so much you have to go through
[01:58.00]Find a girl, settle down
[02:01.00]If you want, you can marry
[02:05.00]Look at me--I am old
[02:08.00]But I'm happy
[02:10.00]
[02:11.00]All the times, that I've cried
[02:14.00]Keeping all the things I knew inside
[02:18.00]And it's hard
[02:20.00]But it's harder to ignore it
[02:23.00]
[02:24.00]If they were right--I'd agree
[02:28.00]But it's them--they know
[02:30.00]Not me. Now there's a way, and I know
[02:34.00]That I have to go away
[02:38.00]I know, I have to go.
[02:45.00]End
