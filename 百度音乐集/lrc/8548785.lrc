[00:10.46]Clair, the moment I met you I swear
[00:17.38]I felt as if something somewhere
[00:21.82]Had happened to me
[00:24.10]Which I couldn't see
[00:26.35]And then
[00:28.68]The moment I met you again
[00:33.28]I knew in my heart we were friends
[00:37.80]It had to be so
[00:40.20]It couldn't be no
[00:42.34]But try as hard as I might do I don't know why
[00:49.30]You get to me in a way I can't describe
[00:53.90]Words mean so little when you look up and smile
[00:57.95]I don't care what people say,
[01:00.19]To me you're more than a child
[01:02.81]Oh! Clair, Clair
[01:07.80]Clair, if ever a moment so rare
[01:14.42]as captured for all to compare
[01:18.99]That moment is you
[01:21.22]It's all that you do
[01:23.48]But why in spite of our age difference do I cry
[01:30.47]Each time I leave you I feel I could die
[01:34.99]Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
[01:38.95]I'm going to marry you
[01:41.36]Will you marry me Uncle Ray?
[01:44.12]Oh! Clair, Clair
[02:04.77]Clair, I've told you before
[02:08.73]Don't you dare
[02:11.20]Get back into bed
[02:13.83]Can't you see that it's late
[02:15.73]No you can't have a drink
[02:17.83]Oh! all right then but wait just a bit
[02:22.93]While I, in an effort to baby sit,
[02:27.58]Catch of my breath what there is left of it.
[02:32.16]You can be murder at this hour of the day
[02:36.24]But in the morning this hour
[02:38.49]Will seem a lifetime away
[02:40.69]Oh! Clair, Clair
