[00:11.75]The Freshest & Hottest R&B/ Hip-Hop Music in MaxRNB
[00:16.01]
[00:19.38]It's only a paper cut
[00:22.37]But it feels like a knife
[00:24.96]It's only a moment
[00:27.32]But i feels like my life
[00:29.24]It's always the little things
[00:31.90]That slip through and take you by surprise
[00:37.74]When you don't call
[00:40.38]When you stay gone
[00:42.80]When you don't say everything you're thinking
[00:47.86]Try to be strong
[00:50.21]Try to brush off
[00:52.33]And pretend that nothing in me is breaking
[00:57.16]
[00:57.54]But inside it hits like thunder
[01:02.16]Inside the tears run just like a flood
[01:07.53]I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong
[01:12.09]But it feels like a quiet storm
[01:17.00](whoa whoa whoa whoa)
[01:21.76]And it hurts more than you'll ever know
[01:26.95](whoa whoa whoa whoa)
[01:31.36]Cos it feels like a quiet storm
[01:36.65]
[01:37.25]Breaking up blue skies
[01:39.35]Are the words from you lips
[01:40.91]Changing the atmosphere
[01:43.92]When everything shifts
[01:46.00]You're so unpredictable
[01:48.76]It's hard to find reasons why to let you back in
[01:52.96]When you don't call
[01:56.92]When you stay gone
[01:59.73]When you don't say everything you're thinking
[02:04.63]Hard to be strong
[02:06.83]Hard to brush off
[02:09.27]And pretend that nothing in me is breaking
[02:13.84]
[02:14.41]But inside it hits like thunder
[02:18.68]Inside the tears run just like a flood
[02:24.28]I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong
[02:28.88]But it feels like a quiet storm
[02:33.76](whoa whoa whoa whoa)
[02:39.78]And it hurts more than you'll ever know
[02:43.79](whoa whoa whoa whoa)
[02:48.10]Cos it feels like a quiet storm
[02:53.48]
[02:54.14]And i'll never let you know
[02:58.35]But inside the tempest grow (whoa)
[03:11.75]
[03:12.41]Cos inside it hits like thunder
[03:18.92]Inside the tears run just like a flood
[03:24.27]I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong
[03:30.39]But it feels like a quiet storm
[03:34.03]
[03:34.99]But inside it hits like thunder
[03:38.17]Inside the tears run just like a flood
[03:43.62]I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong
[03:48.16]But it feels like a quiet storm
