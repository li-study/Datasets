[00:16.42]I hold on so nervously
[00:19.91]To me and my drink
[00:22.85]I wish it was cooling me
[00:25.62]But so far, has not been good
[00:28.90]It's been shitty
[00:31.12]And I feel awkward, as I should
[00:34.87]This club has got to be
[00:37.74]The most pretentious thing
[00:40.84]Since I thought you and me
[00:43.79]Well I am imagining
[00:47.19]A dark lit place
[00:49.13]Or your place or my place
[00:51.29]Well I'm not paralyzed
[00:53.69]But, I seem to be struck by you
[00:56.89]I want to make you move
[00:59.07]Because you're standing still
[01:01.63]If your body matches
[01:03.79]What your eyes can do
[01:05.85]You'll probably move right through
[01:08.10]Me on my way to you
[01:10.48]
[01:11.07]I hold out for one more drink
[01:14.35]Before I think
[01:17.11]I'm looking too desperately
[01:19.92]But so far has not been fun
[01:23.11]I should just stay home
[01:25.51]
[01:26.20]If one thing really means one
[01:29.23]This club will hopefully
[01:32.35]Be closed in three weeks
[01:35.20]That would be cool with me
[01:38.08]Well I'm still imagining
[01:41.55]A dark lit place
[01:43.48]Or your place or my place
[01:45.64]Well I'm not paralyzed
[01:48.05]But, I seem to be struck by you
[01:51.21]I want to make you move
[01:53.30]Because you're standing still
[01:55.98]If your body matches
[01:58.00]What your eyes can do
[02:00.21]You'll probably move right through
[02:02.43]Me on my way to you
[02:05.37]
[02:22.04]Well I'm not paralyzed
[02:24.20]But, I seem to be struck by you
[02:27.30]I want to make you move
[02:29.50]Because you're standing still
[02:32.11]If your body matches
[02:34.24]What your eyes can do
[02:36.39]You'll probably move right through
[02:38.51]Me on my way to you
[02:40.93]Not paralyzed
[02:42.35]But, I seem to be struck by you
[02:45.40]I want to make you move
[02:47.65]Because you're standing still
[02:50.22]If your body matches
[02:52.49]What your eyes can do
[02:54.47]You'll probably move right through
[02:56.62]Me on my way to you
[02:59.48]
[03:03.59]You'll probably move right through
[03:05.68]Me on my way to you
[03:08.78]
[03:12.66]You'll probably move right through
[03:14.78]Me on my way to you
