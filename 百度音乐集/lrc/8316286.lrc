[00:00.00]Everything'll Be Alright
[00:07.20]Joshua Radin
[00:09.98]
[00:10.00]Way down, in New York town
[00:17.06]Thinking about the way she loved me
[00:22.71]There's a hole in my pocket
[00:24.89]That's about her size
[00:27.78]But I think everything
[00:30.52]Is gonna be alright
[00:33.85]Yes I hope everything
[00:35.89]Is gonna be alright
[00:38.36]
[00:50.87]The smiling face, straight in LA
[00:56.46]The gifts are found at the bar
[01:01.99]But I wish my car
[01:03.82]Could drive to her tonight
[01:06.87]Then I'd know everything
[01:09.54]Is gonna be alright
[01:13.08]Yes then I'd know
[01:15.47]It'll be alright
[01:17.97]
[01:30.11]The rain in New Orleans, forgot to end
[01:35.34]But the mouths of the people are dry
[01:40.87]And we watch and wait
[01:42.74]And do nothing but sigh
[01:45.43]And hope everything
[01:48.38]Is gonna turn alright
[01:52.19]But I don't know
[01:53.79]If it'll be alright
[01:56.54]
[02:09.02]But I look at you, warm in your dream
[02:13.00]While your mobile dances above
[02:19.98]And I think to myself
[02:21.92]It's a beautiful night
[02:24.13]And I know everything
[02:27.20]Is gonna be alright
[02:31.29]Yes now I know
[02:33.50]It'll be alright
