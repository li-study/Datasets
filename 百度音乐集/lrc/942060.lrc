[00:03]作曲人 : Bart Howard 填词人 : Bart Howard
[00:19]Fly me to the moon
[00:21]And let me play among the stars,
[00:26]Let me see you what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.
[00:33]In other words, hold my hand.
[00:40]In other words, baby, kiss me
[01:47][00:48]Fill my heart with song
[01:50][00:50]And let me sing forever more
[01:55][00:55]You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.
[02:01][01:02]In other words, please be true.
[02:09][01:10]In other words, I love you
