[00:15.17]Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
[00:20.76]And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
[00:28.28]And I seem to find the happiness I seek
[00:34.24]When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
[00:38.96]
[00:41.60]Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
[00:47.16]And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
[00:54.19]Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
[01:00.61]When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
[01:05.23]
[01:07.36]Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
[01:10.72]And to reach the highest peak,
[01:14.09]But it doesn't thrill me half as much
[01:17.03]As dancing cheek to cheek.
[01:19.37]
[01:20.12]Oh! I love to go out fishing
[01:23.24]In a river or a creek,
[01:26.59]But I don't enjoy it half as much
[01:29.90]As dancing cheek to cheek.
[01:32.34]
[01:33.63]Dance with me
[01:35.89]I want my arm about you;
[01:39.63]The charm about you
[01:42.65]Will carry me thro' to Heaven
[01:46.33]
[01:48.86]I'm in Heaven,
[01:52.33]and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
[01:59.70]And I seem to find the happiness I seek
[02:06.08]When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
[03:01.73]Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
[03:04.69]And to reach the highest peak,
[03:08.09]But it doesn't thrill me half as much
[03:11.06]As dancing cheek to cheek.
[03:13.57]
[03:13.95]Oh! I love to go out fishing
[03:17.34]In a river or a creek,
[03:20.29]But I don't enjoy it half as much
[03:23.65]As dancing cheek to cheek.
[03:26.67]
[03:27.22]Dance with me
[03:29.15]I want my arm about you;
[03:32.61]The charm about you
[03:35.70]Will carry me thro' to Heaven
[03:39.00]
[03:41.47]I'm in Heaven,
[03:44.80]and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
[03:51.58]And I seem to find the happiness I seek
[03:57.79]When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
