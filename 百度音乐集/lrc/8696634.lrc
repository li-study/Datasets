[00:00.00]I'll find a way to see you again
[00:12.43]I'll find a way to see you again
[00:22.59]
[00:28.15]I used to think that anything I'd do
[00:33.04]Wouldn't matter at all anyway
[00:40.60]But now I find that when it comes to you
[00:46.06]I'm the winner of cards I can't play
[00:53.25]Wait for me, wait for me
[00:56.59]Darling, I need you desperately, desperately here
[01:04.63]
[01:04.83]And I'll find a way to see you again
[01:16.99]And I'll find a way to see you again
[01:27.06]
[01:31.86]The rain is like an orchestra to me
[01:37.08]Little gifts from above meant to say
[01:44.67]Girl, you falling at his feet
[01:49.73]Isn't lovely or stunning today
[01:57.43]Wait with me, wait with me
[02:01.04]I'm alive when you're here with me, here with me, stay
[02:08.78]
[02:08.95]And I'll find a way to see you again
[02:21.14]And I'll find a way to see you again
[02:31.00]
[02:32.09]Why do the street lamps die
[02:38.61]When you're passing by
[02:41.64]Like a hand that won't stay on my shoulder tonight
[02:47.76]If you held me close, would you laugh it away
[02:54.57]Would you dare the glance that I steal to stay
[03:03.22]
[03:06.16]And I'll find a way to see you again
[03:18.94]Yes, I'll find a way to see you again
[03:32.25]I'll find a way, a way, a way to see you again
[03:45.00]I'll find a way, a way, a way to see you again
[03:57.66]I'll find a way, a way, a way to see you again
[04:10.29]I'll find a way, a way, a way to see you again
[04:21.17]
[04:31.53]The rain will bring, the rain will bring,
[04:35.05]the rain will bring, the rain will bring me down
[04:44.20]The rain will bring, the rain will bring,
[04:47.89]the rain will bring, the rain will bring me down
[04:57.18]The rain will bring, the rain will bring,
[05:00.67]the rain will bring, the rain will bring me down
