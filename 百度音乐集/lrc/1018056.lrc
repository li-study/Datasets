[00:16.11]in a café just a little down the stairs
[00:20.11]from a city shop selling cameras and things
[00:23.71]i smelled your lighter oil mixed with coffee and cream
[00:27.61]an odor still lingered from the lines you gave me
[00:33.10]you said it did not you? "just do it kill me"

[00:47.06]i seem to be smiling and laughing quite a lot
[00:51.02]i just had a dream and in it you had died
[00:54.88]and i had no choice then but to love you

[01:02.90]
[01:03.61]so wash me cut me i am underwater
[01:07.55]my lungs and breathing are quite affected
[01:11.44]please watch me closely and do check to see
[01:15.30]i dry out completely i dry through and through
[01:19.26]come shine me tear me i am underwater
[01:23.27]relying completely on zero gravity
[01:27.13]and when I do melt down entirely immediately

[01:41.60]
[01:49.66]it was you who was dying there right in front of me
[01:53.44]and i could not stop the tears i could not hold them in
[01:57.47]all of the little things of this little world
[02:01.31]are so very dear to me it hurts to think of them
[02:06.85]oh do not make me have those kind of dreams again
[02:09.18]
[02:09.98]a scent so sweet that it got me dirty
[02:13.97]the troops to protect me were out on patrol
[02:17.82]please watch me closely and do check to see
[02:21.81]i dry out completely i dry through and through
[02:25.79]a lie so big that it got me dirty
[02:29.71]as soon as i said it a wound opened up
[02:33.47]and when i do melt down entirely immediately
[02:39.48]bon appétit

[03:36.05]
[03:39.10]i am not afraid of a little boredom
[03:42.86]why did the two of them ever chance to meet?
[03:46.89]i am not afraid of a little boredom
[03:50.73]why did the two of them ever chance to meet?
