[00:11.03]First, when there's nothing
[00:15.87]but a slow glowing dream
[00:21.37]That your fear seems to hide
[00:26.77]deep inside your mind
[00:32.42]All alone I have cried
[00:37.61]silent tears full of pride
[00:43.01]In a world made of steel,
[00:48.54]made of stone
[00:51.81]
[00:55.89]Well I hear the music,
[01:00.17]close my eyes, feel the rhythm
[01:04.01]Wrap around, take a hold of my heart
[01:10.28]
[01:11.71]What a feeling, bein's believing
[01:19.40]I can't have it all,
[01:21.19]now I'm dancing for my life
[01:27.04]Take your passion, and make it happen
[01:34.60]Pictures come alive,
[01:36.72]you can dance right through your life
[01:43.19]
[01:58.04]Now I hear the music,
[02:01.94]close my eyes, I am rhythm
[02:05.89]In a flash it takes hold of my heart
[02:12.69]
[02:13.50]What a feeling, bein's believing
[02:20.84]I can't have it all,
[02:23.13]now I'm dancing for my life
[02:28.58]Take your passion, and make it happen
[02:36.39]Pictures come alive,
[02:38.56]you can dance right through your life
[02:43.65]
[02:44.53]What a feeling
[02:48.43]
[02:59.97]What a feeling (I am music now),
[03:03.68]bein's believing (I am rhythm now)
[03:07.26]Pictures come alive,
[03:09.50]you can dance right through your life
[03:15.32]What a feeling (I can really have it all)
[03:18.99]What a feeling (I can really have it all)
[03:22.99]I can have it all (I can really have it all)
[03:26.77]Have it all (I can really have it all)
