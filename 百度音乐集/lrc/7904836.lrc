[00:15.11]There's two things I know for sure
[00:21.08]She was sent here from heaven
[00:24.27]And she's daddy's little girl
[00:26.84]As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
[00:32.76]She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
[00:38.73]And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
[00:45.65]Oh but most of all
[00:49.25]Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
[00:54.47]Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
[01:02.25]Walk beside the pony  daddy
[01:05.62]It's my first ride
[01:08.01]I know the cake looks funny  daddy
[01:11.35]But I sure tried
[01:13.64]Oh with all that I've done wrong
[01:16.48]I must've done something right
[01:20.60]To deserve a hug every morning
[01:25.95]butterfly kisses at night
[01:29.74]
[01:34.23]Sweet sixteen today
[01:40.12]She's looking like her mother
[01:43.05]A little more everyday
[01:46.15]One part woman
[01:49.49]The other part girl
[01:52.38]To perfume and makeup
[01:55.39]From ribbons and curls
[01:58.30]Trying her wings out in a great big world
[02:04.51]But I remember
[02:08.36]Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
[02:13.74]Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
[02:21.21]You know how much I love you  daddy
[02:24.68]If you don't mind
[02:27.28]I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time
[02:32.68]Oh  with all that I've done wrong
[02:35.54]I must've done something right
[02:40.26]To deserve a hug every morning
[02:44.55]butterfly kisses at night
[02:49.63]
[03:01.92]She'll change her name today
[03:08.45]She'll make a promise
[03:10.89]And I'll give her away
[03:13.91]Standing in the bedroom just staring at her
[03:19.80]She asks me what I'm thinking
[03:22.85]And I said I'm not sure
[03:25.63]Just feel like I'm losing my baby girl
[03:31.80]Then she leaned over
[03:35.39]And gave me
[03:36.47]Butterfly kisses with her mother there
[03:41.82]Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
[03:48.81]Walk me down the aisle  daddy
[03:52.51]It's just about time
[03:55.01]Does my wedding gown look pretty  daddy
[03:58.26]Daddy  don't cry
[04:00.49]Oh  with all that I've done wrong
[04:03.39]I must've done something right
[04:08.13]To deserve a hug every morning
[04:12.62]And butterfly kisses
[04:15.70]A hug in the morning
[04:18.64]And butterfly kisses
[04:22.30]At night
