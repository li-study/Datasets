[00:01.12]Lights - River
[00:05.89]
[00:22.30]Out across cities I see buildings turn into piles,
[00:26.51]And watch the world in wonder as mountains turn into tiles
[00:30.81]And trees losing their leaves and their faces becoming tired
[00:34.76]I wish I could discover something that doesn't expire
[00:38.90]Come and stumble me
[00:43.28]
[00:44.24]Take me river, carry me far
[00:48.75]Lead me river, like a mother
[00:53.10]Take me over to some other unknown,
[00:59.36]Pull me in the undertow
[01:02.81]
[01:03.77]Such other things that make a kingdom rumble and shatter
[01:07.84]The same dynamic that another day would never matter
[01:12.24]It really just depends on who's giving and who's receiving
[01:16.53]And things that don't make sense are always a little deceiving
[01:20.84]Come and humble me
[01:25.10]
[01:25.59]Take me river, carry me far
[01:30.12]Lead me river, like a mother
[01:34.34]Take me over to some other unknown,
[01:40.72]Pull me in the undertow
[01:44.54]
[01:45.03]I wanna go where you're going,
[01:49.29]A follower following,
[01:53.63]Changing but never changed,
[01:57.94]Claiming but never claimed
[02:22.51][02:04.46]
[02:40.34][02:22.97][02:05.27]Take me river, carry me far
[02:44.65][02:27.07][02:09.31]Lead me river, like a mother
[02:48.66][02:31.15][02:13.70]Take me over to some other unknown,
[02:52.86][02:37.57][02:20.17]Pull me in the undertow
[02:58.98]
