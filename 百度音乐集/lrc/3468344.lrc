[00:01.22]Sarah Brightman - In the Bleak Midwinter
[00:02.63]
[00:12.54]In the bleak mid-winter
[00:18.32]Frosty wind made moan,
[00:23.94]Earth stood hard as iron,
[00:29.68]Water like a stone;
[00:35.21]Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
[00:41.04]Snow on snow,
[00:46.84]In the bleak mid-winter
[00:52.64]Long ago.
[00:58.74]
[01:01.06]Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
[01:07.00]Nor earth sustain;
[01:12.54]Heaven and earth shall flee away
[01:18.20]When He comes to reign:
[01:24.01]In the bleak mid-winter
[01:29.58]A stable-place sufficed
[01:34.64]The Lord God Almighty,
[01:41.03]Jesus Christ.
[01:53.67]
[01:55.70]Angels and archangels
[02:01.12]May have gathered there,
[02:06.66]Cherubim and seraphim
[02:12.33]Thronged the air,
[02:18.03]But only His mother1
[02:23.69]In her maiden bliss,
[02:29.17]Worshipped the Beloved
[02:34.71]With a kiss.
[02:40.35]
[02:40.71]What can I give Him,
[02:46.42]Poor as I am?
[02:52.36]If I were a shepherd
[02:58.16]I would bring a lamb,
[03:04.14]If I were a wise man
[03:09.93]I would do my part,
[03:15.86]Yet what I can I give Him,
[03:21.75]Give my heart.
[03:28.81]
