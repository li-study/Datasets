[00:00.07]Hypnotherapist:
[00:00.08]You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light
[00:04.32]Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime
[00:09.43]As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consness remembering all you have learned
[00:16.21]When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present, feeling peaceful and refreshed
[00:24.17]Open your eyes, Nicholas
[00:25.65]
[01:40.56]The miracle:
[01:41.64]Friday evening
[01:43.99]The blood still on my hands
[01:46.74]To think that she would leave me now
[01:49.62]For that ungrateful man
[01:51.98]
[01:53.31]Sole survivor
[01:55.35]No witness to the crime
[01:58.32]I must act fast to cover up
[02:01.18]I think that theres still time
[02:03.57]
[02:04.76]He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
[02:10.59]They'll buy into the words that I wrote
[02:16.25]
[02:18.32]This feeling inside me
[02:23.35]Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
[02:29.88]No longer torn in two
[02:34.63]I'd take my own life before losing you
[02:40.52]
[02:50.17]Victoria:
[02:51.61]Feeling good this friday afternoon
[02:56.70]I ran into julian
[02:59.27]Said we'd get together soon
[03:02.66]
[03:03.24]He's always had my heart
[03:05.02]He needs to know
[03:08.25]I'll break free of the miracle
[03:10.71]It's time for him to go
[03:13.71]
[03:15.00]This feeling inside me
[03:19.89]Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
[03:26.73]No longer torn in two
[03:31.46]He'd kill his brother if he only knew
[03:37.41]
[03:38.75]Their love renewed
[03:41.90]They'd rendezvous
[03:45.65]In a pathway out of view
[03:50.35]They thought no one knew
[03:53.37]Then came a shot out of the night
[04:03.60]
[04:44.56]The sleeper:
[04:45.43]One last time
[04:50.66]We'll lay down today
[04:55.79]One last time
[05:00.97]Until we fade away
[05:06.16]One last time
[05:11.32]We'll lay down today
[05:16.51]One last time
[05:22.92]We fade away
[05:28.29]
[05:53.31]As their bodies lie still
[05:56.95]And the ending draws near
[06:00.92]Spirits rise through the air
[06:04.68]All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear
[06:10.31]A blinding light comes into view
[06:13.83]An old soul exchanged for a new
[06:17.78]A familiar voice comes shining through
[06:24.60]
[06:26.72]Nicholas:
[06:27.78]This feeling inside me
[06:32.14]Finally found my life, I'm finally free
[06:39.02]No longer torn in two
[06:43.79]I learned about my life by living through you
[06:49.82]
[06:50.65]This feeling inside me
[06:55.37]Finally found my life, I'm finally free
[07:02.23]No longer torn in two
[07:06.99]Living my own life by learning from you
[07:13.15]
[07:14.24]We'll meet again my friend someday soon
[07:28.38]

[10:12.56]News in London, France, Russia and Italy have deleted their lead story,
[10:13.99]All anticipating the outcome of the man considered to be a member of American nobility
[10:20.92]And as you can imagine, as ties have grown darker here over Washington,
[10:24.18]The mood has grown darker as well and people here are beginning to resign themselves to the possibility
[10:29.23]That they are witnessing yet another tragedy iong string of misfortunes
[10:34.18]Reaction from everywhere, from washington and certainly from around the world has gues...
