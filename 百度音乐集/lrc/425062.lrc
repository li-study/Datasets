[00:00.00]Nick Carter - Help Me
[00:04.20]
[00:06.20]I wish I could define
[00:08.32]All the thoughts that crossed my mind
[00:11.34]They seem too big for me to choose
[00:14.03]I don't know which ones to use
[00:16.22]When I'm falling down so far
[00:18.87]I think I'll never see your light
[00:22.26]Bouncing off of me
[00:24.33]Shining down here from your eyes
[02:20.53][01:13.29][00:27.84]Help me
[02:22.47][01:15.27][00:29.66]Figure out the difference
[02:24.71][01:17.63][00:31.71]Between right and wrong
[02:26.41][01:19.30][00:33.74]Weak and strong
[02:28.02][01:20.49][00:35.20]Day and night
[02:28.84][01:21.68][00:36.21]Where I belong and
[02:31.08][01:24.14][00:38.52]Help me
[02:33.27][01:26.16][00:40.46]Make the right decisions
[02:35.17][01:28.13][00:42.62]Know which way to turn
[02:36.98][01:29.90][00:44.14]Lessons to learn
[02:38.69][01:31.33][00:45.66]And just what my purpose is here
[02:42.47][01:35.06][00:49.71]
[00:51.49]It's like I got the signals crossed
[00:53.81]With messages I can't decode
[00:56.92]Half asleep, never wide awake
[00:59.00]And I'm in complete overload
[01:01.56]I got so much information here
[01:04.54]And nothing I can really grasp
[01:08.08]I should know the truth
[01:09.76]But I'm too afraid so I have to ask
[01:35.48]Wanna love you
[01:37.48]More than anything
[01:40.70]I need you
[01:42.15]In my every dream
[01:43.49]You're there for me
[01:46.05]Do you love me?
[01:48.16]Oh, I am no angel
[01:52.35]Just an ordinary man
[01:54.95]
[02:44.47][01:55.93]Help me figure out
[02:45.13][01:56.86]Why I'm stuck in the middle
[02:46.38][01:58.17]Trying to understand why I can't
[02:48.17][01:59.83]Why you're such a riddle
[02:49.05][02:00.77]Got my eyes crossed
[02:51.07][02:02.09]I'm thinking so hard
[02:51.84][02:03.47]And I know I'm missing the mark
[02:54.45][02:05.83]Can you help me sort out
[02:55.72][02:07.68]All this information
[02:57.18][02:08.76]I'm just rackin' my brain, baby
[02:58.95][02:10.69]Paying attention
[02:59.97][02:11.64]But I'm still lost
[03:01.21][02:12.88]And at all costs
[02:14.60]I gotta know (gotta know, oh)
[03:02.83]I gotta know
[03:04.07]
