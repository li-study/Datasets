[00:35.78]You walked into my house last night
[00:38.83]I couldn't help but notice
[00:41.70]A light that was long gone still burning strong
[00:45.55]You were sitting
[00:46.91]Your fingers like fuses
[00:49.17]Your eyes were cinnamon
[00:54.31]You said you stand for every known abuse
[00:58.34]That was ever threatened to anyone but you
[01:03.59]And why should I know better by now
[01:06.79]When I'm old enough not to?
[01:09.96]
[01:12.07]While every line speaks the language of love
[01:16.69]It never held the meaning I was thinking of
[01:21.17]And I can't decide over right or wrong
[01:25.53]I guess sometimes you need the place where you belong
[01:29.13]
[01:29.77]Some may sing the wrong words to the wrong melodies
[01:34.20]It's little things like this that matter to me
[01:38.64]Others feel that you should stand
[01:40.77]For every known abuse to hand
[01:43.05]And all the things that they could never see
[01:45.72]
[01:47.93]You said you stood for every known abuse
[01:51.68]That was ever promised to anyone like you
[01:57.02]Don't you wish you knew better by now
[02:00.95]When you're old enough not to?
[02:03.95]
[02:06.05]When every line speaks the language of love
[02:10.58]It never held the meaning I was thinking of
[02:14.91]And I can't decide over right or wrong
[02:19.55]You left the feeling that I just do not belong
[02:23.35]
[02:24.59](Do not belong, do not belong, do not belong)
[02:34.59]
[02:42.11]One drink too many
[02:43.66]And a joke gone too far
[02:45.86]I see a face drive like a stolen car
[02:50.21]Gets harder to hide
[02:52.06]When you're hitching your ride
[02:55.11]Harder to hide what you really saw
[02:58.86]
[03:00.03]Oh yeah, you stand for every known abuse
[03:03.96]That I've ever seen my way through
[03:08.78]Don't I wish I knew better by now?
[03:12.63]Well I think I'm starting to
[03:15.86]
[03:17.86]When every line speaks the language of love
[03:22.64]It never held the meaning I was thinking of
[03:26.91]And I've lost the line between right or wrong
[03:31.34]I just want to find the place where I belong
[03:35.61]
[03:53.73]Why should you know better by now
[03:57.14]When you're old enough not to?
[04:02.87]I wish I knew better by now
[04:06.19]When I'm old enough not to
