[00:-5.47]My Prayer
[00:-4.50]-The Platters
[00:-3.07]

[00:02.19]When the twilight is gone
[00:07.60]and no songbirds are singing
[00:12.74]When the twilight is gone
[00:17.99]you come into my heart
[00:22.75]And here in my heart you will stay
[00:28.90]while I pray
[00:34.27]
[00:38.25]My prayer is to linger with you
[00:50.39]At the end of the day
[00:57.18]in a dream that's divine
[01:05.06]My prayer is a rapture in blue
[01:17.49]With the world far away
[01:23.96]and your lips close to mine
[01:29.27]
[01:32.56]Tonight while our hearts are aglow
[01:46.40]Oh tell me the words
[01:51.01]that I'm longing to know
[01:55.15]
[01:58.69]My prayer and the answer you give
[02:11.16]May they still be the same
[02:17.98]for as long as we live
[02:24.26]That you'll always be there
[02:31.42]at the end of my prayer
[02:41.58]
