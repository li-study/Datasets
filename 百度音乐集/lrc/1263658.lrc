[00:05.50]How Come,How Long
[00:11.35]Babyface
[00:16.35]
[00:24.50]There was a girl I used to know
[00:27.50]She was oh so beautiful
[00:30.50]But she's not here anymore
[00:35.50]She had a college degree
[00:39.50]Smart as anyone could be
[00:42.50]She had so much to live for
[00:46.50]But she fell in love with the wrong kinda man
[00:52.50]He abused her love and treated her so bad
[00:58.50]There was not enough education in her world
[01:04.50]that could save life of this little girl
[01:10.50]How come, how long
[01:13.50]It's not right, it's so wrong
[01:16.50]Do we let it just go on
[01:19.50]Turn our backs and carry on
[01:22.50]Wake up, for it's too late
[01:25.50]Right now, we can't wait
[01:28.50]She won't have a second try
[01:31.50]Open up your hearts
[01:33.50]As well as your eyes
[01:38.02]
[01:47.00]She tried to give a cry for help
[01:50.50]she even blamed things on herself
[01:53.50]But no one came to her aid
[01:59.50]Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell
[02:02.50]That's what we'd like to tell our self
[02:05.50]But no !it wasn't that way
[02:09.50]So she fell in love
[02:12.50]With the wrong kinda man
[02:15.50]And she paid with her life for loving that man
[02:21.50]So we cannot ignore,we must look for the signs
[02:27.50]And maybe next time we must save somebody's life
[02:33.50]How come, how long
[02:36.50]It's not right, it's so wrong
[02:39.50]Do we let it just go on
[02:42.50]Turn our backs and carry on
[02:45.50]Wake up, for it's too late
[02:48.50]Right now, we can't wait
[02:51.50]She won't have a second try
[02:54.50]Open up your hearts
[02:56.50]As well as your eyes
[03:02.29]
[03:20.50]Oh I on occasion met that guy
[03:25.85]It's been a feeling deep inside
[03:28.83]Some about it wasn't right
[03:33.15]Oh The way he proves himself a man
[03:38.02]By beating his woman with his hands
[03:40.96] Always wishing that she'd seen the light
[03:45.17] How can someone like that call himself a man
[03:49.98]He's not a man
[03:51.32]In reality, he's far more less than
[03:56.81]And we cannot ignore
[03:59.31]Whenever we see the signs
[04:03.17]Cause any kind of abuse
[04:05.23] God knows, it's a crime
[04:09.33]How come, how long
[04:12.38]It's not right, it's so wrong
[04:15.42]Do we let it just go on
[04:18.05]Turn our backs and carry on
[04:21.26]Wake up, for it's too late
[04:24.32]Right now, we can't wait
[04:27.05]She won't have a second try
[04:29.96]Open up your hearts As well as your eyes
[04:43.97]
