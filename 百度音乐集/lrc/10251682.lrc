[00:07.98]I think you can do much better than me
[00:13.95]After all the lies I made you believe
[00:21.52]Guilt kicks in and I start to see
[00:27.73]The edge of the bed
[00:28.92]Where your nightgown used to be
[00:35.35]I told myself I wouldn't miss you
[00:39.63]But I remembered
[00:42.29]What it feels like beside you
[00:48.67]I really miss your hair in my face
[00:52.23]And the way your innocence tastes
[00:56.04]And I think you should know this
[00:59.92]You deserve much better than me
[01:16.60]While looking through your old box of notes
[01:22.28]I found those pictures I took
[01:23.97]That you were looking for
[01:30.02]If there's one memory I don't want to lose
[01:35.80]That time at the mall
[01:37.59]You and me in the dressing room
[01:43.75]I told myself I won't miss you
[01:48.00]But I remembered
[01:50.84]What it feels like beside you
[01:57.22]I really miss your hair in my face
[02:00.72]And the way your innocence tastes
[02:04.50]And I think you should know this
[02:08.49]You deserve much better than me
[02:12.02]The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
[02:15.37]Wish I never would've said it's over
[02:19.05]And I can't pretend that I won't think about you when I'm older
[02:29.23]Cause we never really had our closure
[02:32.80]This can't be the end
[02:42.06]I really miss your hair in my face
[02:45.28]And the way your innocence tastes
[02:49.15]And I think you should know this
[02:53.04]You deserve much better than me
[02:55.58]I really miss your hair in my face
[02:58.98]And the way your innocence tastes
[03:02.86]And I think you should know this
[03:06.71]You deserve much better than me
[03:10.01](And I think you should know this)
[03:13.84](You deserve much better than me)
[03:16.69](And I think you should know this)
[03:20.37](You deserve much better than me)
[03:23.52](And I think you should know this)
[03:27.18](You deserve much better than me)
[03:30.21](And I think you should know this)
