[00:16.43]Walking on walking on broken glass
[00:24.60]You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew
[00:34.10]But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you
[00:41.60]Since you've abandoned me
[00:46.05]My whole life has crashed
[00:50.09]Won't you pick the pieces up
[00:53.81]Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
[00:58.62]Walking on walking on broken glass
[01:06.20]Walking on walking on broken glass
[01:14.50]The sun's still shining in big blue sky
[01:19.11]But it don't mean nothing to me
[01:23.76]Oh let the rain come down
[01:28.03]Let the wind blow through me
[01:31.82]I'm living in an empty room
[01:35.91]With all the windows smashed
[01:40.02]And I've got so little left to loose
[01:43.21]That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
[01:49.05]Walking on walking on broken glass
[01:56.50]And if you're trying to cut me down
[02:01.28]You know that I might bleed
[02:05.66]Cause if you're trying to cut me down
[02:09.83]I know that you'll succeed
[02:13.41]And if you want to hurt me
[02:17.73]There's nothing left to fear
[02:21.91]Cause if you want to hurt me
[02:26.35]You're doing really well my dear
[02:38.41]Now everyone of us was made to suffer
[02:43.25]Everyone of us was made to weep
[02:47.53]But we've been hurting one another
[02:51.62]And now the pain has cut too deep
[02:55.62]So take me from the wreckage
[02:59.31]Save me from the blast
[03:03.56]Lift me up and take me back
[03:07.31]Don't let me keep on walking
[03:11.14]I can't keep on walking on broken glass
[03:18.78]Walking on walking on broken glass
