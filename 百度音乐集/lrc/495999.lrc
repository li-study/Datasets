[00:06.00]
[00:07.34]All that blotter going to twist up your mind
[00:11.50]You can do it, just not all the time
[00:15.59]Hiding in your room, you'll be feeling fine
[00:20.38]
[00:22.58]Always manage to have something to sell
[00:26.51]Talk on the telephone while painting your nails
[00:30.55]Little plastic bags and a digiscale
[00:35.65]
[00:36.68]Aw, this hallway's full of plastic kids
[00:40.66]Aw, they jump and make the CD skip
[00:45.57]
[00:46.86]I'm never telling what I find out
[00:50.67]I'm going to love you like the New South
[00:54.53]You drive me crazy with your foul mouth
[00:57.64]Until you meet me down in Cabbage Town
[01:02.58]Down in Cabbage Town
[01:06.14]
[01:07.26]The way I see it we got plenty of time
[01:11.57]It's going to happen but just not overnight
[01:14.90]Bring a pack of cards and a box of wine
[01:20.74]
[01:22.26]Oh, on the day when I flash that badge
[01:26.51]Just try to think of the other half
[01:30.09]It's hard living when it's a matter of fact
[01:35.80]
[01:36.90]But this city's full of lazy kids
[01:40.63]Sweetie, someone's got to steer this ship
[01:45.41]
[01:46.61]I'm never telling what I find out
[01:50.51]I'm going to love you like the New South

[01:57.67]Come on and meet me down in Cabbage Town
[02:02.66]Come down to Cabbage Town
[02:06.53]
[02:07.47]Well it's just like old friends
[02:11.43]To play "Remember When . . . ?"
[02:15.56]But if you want my help, I'm in
[02:20.59]
[02:22.51]I'm never telling what I found out
[02:26.59]I'm going to love you like the New South
[02:30.06]You're talking crazy with your loud mouth
[02:33.93]Come on and meet me down in Cabbage Town

[02:50.31]You make me crazy with your foul mouth
[02:53.68]Oh, won't you meet me down in Cabbage Town
[02:58.57]Come down to Cabbage Town
[03:01.95]
