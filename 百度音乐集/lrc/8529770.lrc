[00:00.00]Sheryl Crow - Lifetimes
[00:04.91]
[00:06.91]Take off your halo, take off your golden crown
[00:16.17]The spotlight's off, the shades are down
[00:25.73]Where are your friends now,
[00:30.46]they're ghosts in a windowpane
[00:35.24]Sometimes it's hard to stay the same
[00:40.80]
[00:42.49]We can live lifetimes in a single day
[00:52.09]No matter what you do, I love you anyway
[01:01.62]You say if you're lost inside;
[01:05.75]well, I get lonely, too
[01:10.93]Even in the worst of times, I give my best to you
[01:18.63]
[01:23.32]I dreamed I was swimming, fighting the undertow
[01:33.20]Drifting in circles, no place to go
[01:42.50]And when I woke up, I was wringing wet
[01:52.19]So much stronger than before
[01:57.23]
[01:59.36]We can live lifetimes in a single day
[02:08.87]No matter what you do, I love you anyway
[02:18.56]You say if you're lost inside; well, I get lonely, too
[02:27.81]Even in the worst of times, I give my best to you
[02:35.97]
[02:40.13]The words escape
[02:44.82]The silence made
[02:49.60]The looks betray
[02:54.35]I'm not afraid
[03:01.20]
[03:16.48]We can live lifetimes in a single day
[03:25.76]No matter what you do, I love you anyway
[03:35.37]You say if you're lost inside; well, I get lonely, too
[03:44.32]Even in the worst of times, I give my best to you
[03:54.26]Even in the worst of times, I give my best to you
[04:03.77]
