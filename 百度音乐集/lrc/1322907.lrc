[00:05.68][00:13.98][04:27.96]
[00:17.68]Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
[00:26.94]Take the heat from the sun
[00:32.48][02:53.09][03:08.03]Little sister
[00:36.26]I know that everything is not ok
[00:41.92]But you're like honey on my tongue
[00:46.33]True love never can be rent
[00:53.32]But only true love can keep beauty innocent
[01:03.42][02:04.04]I could never take a chance
[01:07.07][02:07.74][03:42.51]Of losing love to find romance
[01:10.35][02:11.09][02:26.25][03:45.79][04:01.00]In the mysterious distance
[01:14.17][01:29.32][02:14.84][02:30.02][03:49.66][04:04.75]Between a man and a woman
[01:18.50][03:38.79]No I could never take a chance
[01:22.25]'Cause I could never understand
[01:25.71]The mysterious distance
[01:33.32]You can run from love
[01:36.92]And if it's really love it will find you
[01:43.27]Catch you by the heel
[01:48.30]But you can't be numb for love
[01:52.07]The only pain is to feel nothing at all
[01:58.44][04:18.83]How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
[02:19.43]And you're the one, there's no-one else
[02:22.94]You make me want to lose myself
[02:34.23]Brown eyed girl across the street
[02:37.71]On rue Saint Divine
[02:41.83]I thought this is the one for me
[02:45.02]But she was already mine
[02:48.98]You were already mine...
[02:56.49]I've been sleeping in the street again
[03:02.91]Like a stray dog
[03:11.69]I've been trying to feel complete again
[03:17.41]But you're gone and so is God
[03:21.68]The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
[03:28.97]When the soul wants...the soul waits ...
[03:53.84]For love and sex and faith and fear
[03:57.55]And all the things that keep us here
[04:22.44][04:23.71]
