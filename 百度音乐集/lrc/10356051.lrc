[00:20.90]Somehow I sit here, and I think about it
[00:23.95]Who needs love, for I've been without it
[00:26.75]When I met you, I didn't wanna let you in
[00:29.80]But you did something to me when you rubbed my hand
[00:33.50]Told me you would never do me wrong
[00:36.10]That what we have together will be so strong
[00:38.85]So tell me what is this, I'm falling, keep falling, yeah
[00:42.40]
[00:43.00]How could you take my heart and run
[00:45.85]I was so mistreated
[00:48.40]I thought that you could be the one
[00:50.90]You were all I needed
[00:52.20]
[00:52.95]Boy you had a good girl
[00:55.20]I wanna give you the world
[00:57.90]Even all the stars above
[01:00.23]Wanna give you my love, yes all of my love
[01:02.50]
[01:03.20]No matter how hard that I try to fight it
[01:06.25]There's no any other boy that can deny it
[01:09.00]Coming around and out, spinning inside
[01:11.50]And it takes all that I got to fight it
[01:13.80]
[01:14.90]When I remember what you did (ooh)
[01:17.50]For believing in what you said
[01:19.50]I put my trust in you
[01:20.75]I gave my best to you
[01:22.15]In the end there's no more you
[01:24.80]
[01:25.50]How could you take my heart and run
[01:27.99]But I was so mistreated (no more you)
[01:30.80]I thought that you could be the one
[01:33.25]You were all I needed
[01:34.80]
[01:35.25]Boy you had a good girl
[01:37.50]I wanna give you the world
[01:40.50]Even all the stars above
[01:42.85]Wanna give you my love, yes all of my love
[01:45.60]
[01:46.50]You had a good girl but you let her slip away
[01:51.75]Why did you, why did you
[01:56.50]
[01:57.32]I was that girl for you that was always by your side
[02:02.50]How could you, how could you, how could you
[02:06.50]
[02:07.00]Boy you had a good girl
[02:09.50]I wanna give you the world
[02:12.10]Even all the stars above
[02:14.50]Wanna give you my love, yes all of my love (ooh, my love)
[02:16.80]
[02:17.50]Boy you had a good girl
[02:19.95]I wanna give you the world
[02:22.89]Even all the stars above
[02:24.88]Wanna give you my love, yes all of my love (ooh, my love)
[02:26.80]
[02:28.15]Boy you had a good girl
[02:30.50]I wanna give you the world (you the world)
