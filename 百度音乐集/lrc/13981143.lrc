[00:00.00]
[00:07.44]I see you from the sky
[00:13.35]And I wonder how long it will take me to get home
[00:20.21]I wait for an hour or so at the carousel
[00:26.70]I have a cigarette to pass the time
[00:30.18]Cause the traffic's hell
[00:32.15]
[00:41.65]I don't want anything more
[00:44.74]Than to see your face when you open the door
[00:47.72]You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
[00:51.11]And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
[00:54.61]Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
[00:57.81]And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk
[01:01.54]I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
[01:04.45]And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
[01:07.84]
[01:14.30]You wipe the tears from my eye
[01:20.47]And you say that all that it takes is a phone call
[01:27.40]I cry at the thought of being alone and then
[01:33.76]I wonder how long it will take til I'm home again
[01:38.08]
[01:48.78]I don't want anything more
[01:51.85]Than to see your face when you open the door
[01:54.79]You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
[01:58.17]And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
[02:01.84]Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
[02:04.95]And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk
[02:08.53]I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
[02:11.52]And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
[02:15.01]
[02:28.98]I know it doesn't seem so fair
[02:35.14]But I'll send you a postcard when I get there
[02:38.82]
[02:42.44]I don't want anything more
[02:45.52]Than to see your face when you open the door
