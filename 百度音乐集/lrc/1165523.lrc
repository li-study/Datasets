[00:00.13]Album: Have A Nice Day
[00:00.64][00:00.69][03:30.11][03:35.45]
[00:00.70]Regrets are all you left
[00:03.37]On your lipstick stains
[00:06.65]Take a picture of our past
[00:09.95]There in that ashtray
[00:14.30]We had our fun
[00:16.31]I used to light your flame
[00:19.70]Like the dancing smoke that rose
[00:22.62]We tried to find our way
[00:26.92][01:19.64][02:16.51]No one told me
[00:30.23][01:23.02][02:19.83]She told me
[00:32.49][01:25.17]Your love's like one last cigarette
[00:35.72][01:28.38][01:41.70][02:51.94][03:05.29]Last cigarette
[00:36.97][01:29.65][02:40.04][02:53.24]I will savor it
[00:38.82][00:45.75][01:31.58][01:45.02][02:55.20][03:08.51][03:15.46][03:18.81][03:22.09]The last cigarette
[00:40.25][01:32.98][02:43.23][02:56.58]Take it in and hold your breath
[00:41.93][01:34.67][02:45.06][02:58.26]Hope it never ends
[00:43.11][01:36.37][02:46.08][02:59.36]But when it's gone, it's gone
[00:53.67]Just to breathe
[00:54.92]Reminds me of what used to be
[00:59.94]The smoke's the ghost that keeps you close
[01:02.99]When I can't sleep
[01:06.61]Don't ask the past to last
[01:09.25]It's about to change
[01:13.08]The memories don't answer
[01:15.72]When I call your name
[01:39.78][02:36.70][02:50.07][03:03.29]One last cigarette
[01:43.01][03:06.66]One I can't forget
[01:46.39][03:09.95]Right there at my fingertips
[01:47.98][03:11.54]I got your taste still on my lips
[01:49.84][03:13.42]Right or wrong
[01:52.44]You're still gone, gone, gone...
[02:22.87]You always lose the girl
[02:29.57]In a Brian Wilson world
[03:16.72](No one told me)
[03:20.10](She told me)
[03:23.47](The last cigarette)
[03:30.51]
