[00:01.50]Oh yeah what we're living in let me tell ya
[00:08.50]It's a wonder man can eat at all
[00:11.50]When things are big that should be small
[00:13.50]Who can tell what magic spell we'll be doing for us
[00:18.50]And I'm giving all my love to this world
[00:22.50]only to be told I can't see I can' t breathe
[00:26.50]no more we will be
[00:29.50]And nothing going to change the way we live
[00:32.50]'cos we can always take but never give
[00:34.50]and now that things are changing for the worse
[00:37.50]see it's a crazy world we're living in
[00:41.50]and I just can see that half of us immersed in sin is
[00:45.50]all we have to give these
[02:43.50][01:44.50][00:47.50]Futures made of virtual insanity
[02:48.50][01:49.50][00:52.50]now always seem to be govern'd by this love we have
[02:53.50][01:54.50][00:57.50]for useless twisting our new technology
[02:58.50][01:59.50][01:02.50]oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
[01:07.50]And I'm thinking what a mess we're in,
[01:10.50]hard to know where to begin
[01:13.50]If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made,
[01:17.50]and now every mother can choose the color of her child
[01:24.50]that's not nature's way
[01:27.50]Well that's what they said yesterday
[01:30.50]there's nothing left to do but pray
[01:32.50]I think it's time I found a new religion
[01:35.50]Waoh it's so insane to synthesize another strain
[01:40.50]there's something in these future that we have to be told
[02:05.50]Now there is no sound for we all live underground
[02:10.50]and now it's virtual insanity
[02:12.50]forget your virtual reality
[02:15.50]oh there's nothing so bad I know yeah
[02:20.50]INSTRUMENTAL BREAK
[03:27.50]Virtual insanity is what we're livin' in
