[00:04.02]
[00:05.02]When your body's had enough of me
[00:10.19]And I'm laying flat out on the floor
[00:15.99]When you think I've loved you all I can
[00:20.89]I'm gonna love you a little bit more
[00:27.36]Come on over here and lay by my side
[00:32.43]I've got to be touching you.
[00:37.86]Let me rub your tired shoulders
[00:43.60]The way I used to do.
[00:48.67]Look into my eyes
[00:51.53]and give me that smile
[00:54.10]The one that always turns me on
[00:59.81]And let me take your harir down
[01:04.82]Cause we're staying up to greet the sun.
[01:11.25]
[01:12.42]And when your body's had enough of me
[01:17.62]And I'm laying flat out on the floor
[01:22.99]When you think I've loved you all I can
[01:27.85]I'm gonna love you a little bit more
[01:32.31]
[01:36.10]Got to say a few things
[01:38.78]that have been on my mind
[01:41.40]You know where my mind has been
[01:46.60]I guess I learned my lessons
[01:51.75]And now's the time to begin
[01:56.38]So if you're feelin' alright
[01:59.46]and you're ready for me
[02:02.07]I know that I'm ready for you
[02:07.18]We better get it on now
[02:12.21]Cause we got our whole life
[02:14.65]to live through
[02:19.45]And when your body's had enough of me
[02:24.66]And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
[02:30.14]When you think I've loved you all I can
[02:34.89]I'm gonna love you a little bit more
