[00:19.24]Remember how it used to be
[00:21.39]Remember how you promised me
[00:23.73]That life would always be good
[00:28.48]You forget the fact you lied to me
[00:30.70]You locked my heart and threw the key
[00:33.01]I'm so misunderstood
[00:37.18]
[00:37.84]What to say when all the words have gone
[00:42.65]Promises, promises
[00:47.33]What to do when all our thoughts have flown
[00:51.98]Promises, promises
[00:56.32]
[00:56.65]Remember how I gave my heart
[00:59.07]And all at once we fell apart
[01:01.45]Was I supposed to forgive you
[01:05.47]You forgot the fact you said to me
[01:08.43]That we were for eternity
[01:10.95]You're so easy to see through
[01:15.60]What to say when all the words have gone
[01:20.34]Promises, promises
[01:25.66]What to do when all our thoughts have flown
[01:29.60]Promises, promises
[01:33.92]
[01:34.28]Remember that I'm over you
[01:36.60]And know that I will make it through
[01:39.04]Hope you never forget it
[01:42.93]The promises you made to me
[01:46.03]Were really lies and fantasy
[01:48.64]Hope you come to regret it
[01:52.14]
[01:53.16]What to say when all the tears have dried
[01:57.81]Promises, promises
[02:02.96]What to think when all our love has died
[02:07.15]Promises, promises
[02:11.02]
[02:12.28]The promises we used to keep have gone
[02:18.51]And with them all the words
[02:22.39]That kept us both from seeing what was wrong
[02:28.52]The rest is silent
[02:32.05]
[02:33.11]What to say when all the words have gone
[02:37.77]Promises, promises
[02:43.10]What to do when all our thoughts have flown
[02:47.31]Promises, promises
[02:52.42]What to say when all the tears have dried
[02:56.61]Promises, promises
[03:02.25]What to think when all our love has died
[03:06.00]Promises, promises.
