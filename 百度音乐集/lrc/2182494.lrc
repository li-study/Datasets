[00:08.31]
[00:11.31]Hot-tempered with the shortest fuse
[00:13.80]You're such a mess with an attitude
[00:17.25]You're working hard, but you're paying more
[00:20.76]You never talk if you don't have to
[00:24.52]You got a job, but you hate the man
[00:27.82]Who takes it all like Uncle Sam
[00:31.26]I want you, you, you, you-you, you-you
[00:34.81]I, I, I-I-I, I want you
[00:38.47]
[00:38.88]Out of gas, so you walk for miles
[00:42.61]To pick me up in your worn out shoes
[00:45.27]You never settle, never take too much
[00:48.41]You count on me, just like I count on you
[00:52.95]Kiss me, like when I first saw you
[00:56.41]I figured out I couldn't be without you

[01:12.98]
[01:13.47]No one will else will do
[01:16.02](I want) No one makes me smile
[01:19.26](I want) No one gets me how
