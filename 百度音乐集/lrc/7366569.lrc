[00:11.26]I'd like to say,
[00:14.39]that I was on your mind
[00:18.33]So I phone you at ten past three,
[00:21.50]in the afternoon
[00:25.39]It's evening for you,
[00:27.86]and another bare hotel room
[00:32.08]So hard to believe,
[00:34.83]that you're dreaming of me too
[00:37.66]But it's true
[00:40.90]
[00:41.23]You only go around, round, round
[00:44.53]You only go around, round, round
[00:48.02]You only go around, round, round
[00:51.59]You only go around, round, round
[00:56.05]
[00:56.84]And Amsterdam,
[00:59.57]I never knew you so well
[01:03.94]The stadium rings with laughter,
[01:07.07]at every turn
[01:10.96]At flying piano's of all things,
[01:14.17]to set your scene
[01:18.09]I'm such a nice man to you,
[01:21.18]but so obscene
[01:23.40]And it's true girl
[01:26.97]
[01:27.20]You only go around, round, round
[01:30.79]You only go around, round, round
[01:33.74]You only go around, round, round
[01:37.37]You only go around, round, round
[01:41.31]
[01:42.59]Jackie big tits,
[01:45.22]is hiding in the corner
[01:49.63]Respect is the word she shouts,
[01:52.82]as I implore her
[01:55.96]Speaks her mind not me,
[01:59.38]cause I was only speaking freely
[02:03.64]Interupt me once more,
[02:06.26]I'll take you to the cleaners
[02:09.03]
[02:09.28]You can't push me around, round, round
[02:12.38]You can't push me around, round, round
[02:15.78]You only go around, round, round
[02:19.28]You only go around, round, round
[02:23.79]
[02:24.74]Jackie big tits
