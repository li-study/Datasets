[00:00.00]The Phantom Of The Opera
[00:07.37]
[00:21.96]In sleep he sang to me
[00:26.47]In dreams he came
[00:30.18]That voice which calls to me
[00:33.91]and speaks my name
[00:38.07]And do I dream again
[00:42.15]For now I find
[00:47.17]The Phantom of the Opera is there
[00:53.87]Inside my mind
[01:05.88]Sing once again with me
[01:09.85]Our strange duet
[01:13.77]My power over you
[01:17.76]Grows stronger yet
[01:21.87]And though you turn from me
[01:25.72]To glance behind
[01:29.67]The Phantom of the Opera is there
[01:37.78]Inside your mind
[01:43.20]
[01:50.84]Those who have seen your face
[01:54.11]Draw back in fear
[01:58.01]I am the mask you wear
[02:02.01]it's me they hear
[02:06.58]Your/my spirit and your/my voice
[02:10.08]In one combined
[02:15.03]The Phantom of the Opera is there
[02:22.06]Inside your/my mind
[02:32.10]He's there
[02:33.64]The Phantom of the Opera
[02:40.28]A……
