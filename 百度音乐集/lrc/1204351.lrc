[00:15.00]They say ev'rything can be replaced,
[00:23.00]Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
[00:30.00]So I remember ev'ry face
[00:38.00]Of ev'ry man who put me here.
[00:45.00]I see my light come shining
[00:53.00]From the west unto the east.
[01:00.00]Any day now, any day now,
[01:08.00]I shall be released.
[01:14.00]They say ev'ry man needs protection,
[01:22.00]they say ev'ry man must fall.
[01:30.00]Yet I swear I see my reflection
[01:37.00]Some place so high above this wall.
[01:45.00]I see my light come shining
[01:52.00]From the west unto the east.
[02:00.00]Any day now, any day now,
[02:07.00]I shall be released.
[02:16.00]Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
[02:23.00]he's a man who swears he's not to blame.
[02:30.00]All day long I hear him shout so loud,
[02:37.00]Crying out that he was framed.
[02:44.00]I see my light come shining
[02:52.00]From the west unto the east.
[02:58.00]Any day now, any day now,
[03:07.00]I shall be released.
[03:12.00]oh
[03:29.00]Any day now, any day now,
[03:37.00]I shall be released.
[03:44.00]Any day now, any day now,
[03:53.00]I shall be released.
