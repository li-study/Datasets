[00:06.75]演唱：张靓颖
[00:09.84]
[00:12.96]It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
[00:20.67]When I try to explain how I feel
[00:26.35]That I still need your love after all that I've done
[00:33.39]You won't believe me
[00:38.04]All you will see is a girl you once knew
[00:43.67]Although she's dressed up to the nines
[00:49.06]At sixes and sevens with you
[00:56.91]And as for fortune  and as for fame
[01:04.33]I never invited them in
[01:10.07]Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
[01:17.47]They are illusions
[01:22.34]They are not the solutions they promised to be
[01:28.01]The answer was here all the time
[01:34.03]I love you and hope you love me
[01:41.46]Don't cry for me Argentina
[01:47.71]The truth is I never left you
[01:52.90]All through my wild days
[01:55.93]My mad existence  I kept my promise
[02:02.40]Don't keep your distance
[02:06.58]
[02:07.42]Have I said too much
[02:10.34]There's nothing more
[02:12.00]I can think of to say to you
[02:16.63]
[02:19.93]But all you have to do
[02:23.09]is look at me to know
[02:26.32]That every word
[02:29.79]is true
[02:39.99]
[02:46.30]谢谢
[02:51.50]
