[00:00.00]我亲爱的前女友
[00:03.50]我为了你吃不下 睡不着还吃安眠药
[00:05.10]你还是离开了我 以后我不会再相信爱情
[00:21.00]It's not the first time
[00:25.00]that I'm feeling, feeling alone
[00:30.00]It's not the last time that tears will flow
[00:39.00]I pray to God, I pray to everybody
[00:46.00]Who can help me?
[00:47.00]You should know, you should know where to go
[01:00.00]I close my eyes and see
[01:06.00]A birth, a son of you and me
[01:19.00]I close my eyes and feel
[01:27.00]Your breath,your touch be there for me
[01:35.00]我不可以为了女人而忘记我的理想
[01:57.00]It's not the first time I say 'hello', you say 'goodbye'
[02:07.00]A misunderstanding's the reason why
[02:15.00]It's not the last time I say 'hello', you say 'goodbye'
[02:24.00]Remember all the dreams we shared for so long
[02:33.00]For so long time
[02:35.00]I close my eyes and see
[02:43.00]A birth, a son of you and me
[02:56.00]I close my eyes and feel
[03:02.00]Your breath, your touch
[03:05.00]Your breath, your touch
[03:07.00]Be there, be there for me
[03:14.00]再见 该死的爱
