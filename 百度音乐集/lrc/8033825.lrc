[00:28.94]Who's to say
[00:31.53]What's impossible
[00:33.26]Well they forgot
[00:36.25]This world keeps spinning
[00:37.65]And with each new day
[00:40.91]I can feel a change in everything
[00:45.62]And as the surface breaks reflections fade
[00:50.32]But in some ways they remain the same
[00:54.92]And as my mind begins to spread its wings
[00:59.66]There's no stopping curiosity
[01:03.82]
[01:04.73]I want to turn the whole thing upside down
[01:09.16]I'll find the things they say just can't be found
[01:13.67]I'll share this love I find with everyone
[01:18.35]We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
[01:22.89]I don't want this feeling to go away
[01:26.25]
[01:43.80]Who's to say
[01:46.50]I can't do everything
[01:48.65]Well I can try
[01:51.33]And as I roll along I begin to find
[01:55.81]Things aren't always just what they seem
[01:59.39]
[02:00.50]I want to turn the whole thing upside down
[02:05.21]I'll find the things they say just can't be found
[02:09.79]I'll share this love I find with everyone
[02:14.62]We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
[02:19.24]This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
[02:25.43]Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
[02:30.63]
[02:31.10]Upside down
[02:33.32]Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
[02:37.91]I don't want this feeling to go away
[02:40.72]
[02:47.48]Please don't go away
[02:57.00]Please don't go away
[03:06.35]Please don't go away
[03:15.92]Is this how it's supposed to be
[03:21.83]Is this how it's supposed to be
