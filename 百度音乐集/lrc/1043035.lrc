[00:36.11]I opened my eyes
[00:40.26]and watched the sunshine
[00:52.99]it had been out all night
[00:57.16]to relax and unwind
[01:08.15]there will come a time gigantic
[01:12.47]waves will crush the junk that I have saved
[01:21.04]when the moon explodes or floats away
[01:26.05]I'll lose the souvenirs I made
[01:32.99]la la la
[01:39.62]I lay down on the grass
[01:43.71]and let the insects do their thing
[01:56.34]she covered me with wings and
[02:00.86]held my head and said 'poor thing'
[02:11.57]there will come a time gigantic
[02:16.10]waves will crush the junk that I have saved
[02:24.31]when the moon explodes or floats away
[02:29.40]i'll lose the souvenirs I made
[02:36.25]la la la
