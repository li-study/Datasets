[00:03.45]Ellie Goulding
[00:07.45]
[00:08.02]I had a way then losing it all on my own
[00:15.41]I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
[00:23.62]And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
[00:31.70]And I'm not keeping now, the strength I need to push me
[00:39.27]
[00:39.67]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[00:44.12]You shine it when I'm alone
[00:47.54]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[00:52.12]And dreaming when they're gone
[00:54.85]
[00:55.63]'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
[00:59.90]Calling, calling, calling home
[01:03.85]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:08.07]You shine it when I'm alone
[01:11.22]Home
[01:12.16]
[01:12.56]Noises, I play within my head
[01:19.44]Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
[01:27.47]And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
[01:35.72]In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe
[01:43.40]
[01:43.75]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:48.03]You shine it when I'm alone
[01:51.44]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[01:56.04]And dreaming when they're gone
[01:59.06]
[01:59.53]'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
[02:03.89]Calling, calling, calling home
[02:07.59]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:12.13]You shine it when I'm alone
[02:15.09]Home
[02:16.37]

[02:36.07]You shine it when I'm alone
[02:39.57]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[02:44.12]And dreaming when they're gone
[02:46.84]
[02:47.33]'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
[02:51.94]Calling, calling, calling home
[02:55.61]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[03:00.13]You shine it when I'm alone
[03:03.19]Home
