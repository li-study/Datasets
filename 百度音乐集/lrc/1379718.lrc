[02:04.67]I know I'm dead before my time
[02:06.29]I know It's coming down
[02:07.55]If you could only see what's right
[02:09.99]You'd see what's coming 'round
[02:12.18]
[02:14.56]So I walk Alone
[02:15.49]I ask no quarter friend
[02:16.30]I walk alone
[02:17.21]Til I find you again
[02:18.13]
[02:18.82]I know no place to call my bed
[02:19.62]But I know this thorny crown
[02:20.74]If you would only feed your head
[02:21.52]You'd see your hands are bound
[02:22.36]
