[00:02.00]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
[00:08.59]Take a sad song and make it better.
[00:15.31]Remember to let her into your heart,
[00:20.60]Then you can start to make it better.
[00:26.41]
[00:27.54]Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
[00:34.00]You were made to go out and get her.
[00:41.10]The minute you let her under your skin,
[00:46.24]Then you begin to make it better.
[00:52.22]
[00:55.01]And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
[01:02.00]Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
[01:11.25]For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
[01:18.18]By making his world a little colder.
[01:24.77]
[01:33.87]Hey Jude, don't let me down.
[01:40.67]You have found her, now go and get her.
[01:47.29]Remember to let her into your heart,
[01:52.33]Then you can start to make it better.
[01:58.42]
[02:00.65]So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
[02:07.25]You're waiting for someone to perform with.
[02:17.26]And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
[02:23.92]The movement you need is on your shoulder.
[02:30.41]
[02:39.50]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
[02:46.02]Take a sad song and make it better.
[02:53.00]Remember to let her under your skin,
[02:57.97]Then you'll begin to make it
[03:02.00]Better better better better better better, oh.
