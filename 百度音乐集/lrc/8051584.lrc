[00:16.71]Every breath you take
[00:21.16]And every move you make
[00:25.65]Every bond you break, every step you take
[03:07.09][02:58.02][01:23.75][00:47.86][00:30.06]I'll be watching you
[00:34.74]Every single day
[00:39.15]And every word you say
[00:43.59]Every game you play, every night you stay
[02:26.83][00:52.64]Oh, can't you see
[02:31.36][00:57.07]You belong to me?
[02:35.78][01:01.61]How my poor heart aches
[02:40.20][01:06.01]With every step you take
[02:44.85][01:10.47]Every move you make
[02:49.26][01:14.86]Every vow you break
[02:53.60][01:19.23]Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
[01:30.49]Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
[01:34.99]I dream at night, I can only see your face
[01:39.35]I look around, but it's you I can't replace
[01:43.89]I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
[01:48.39]I keep crying baby, baby please.
[03:02.80]Every move you make, every step you take
[03:16.44]I'll be watching you
