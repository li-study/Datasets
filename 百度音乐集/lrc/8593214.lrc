[00:34.78]Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
[00:42.08]And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
[00:46.35]But most of all, because I have offended Thee, oh my God
[00:50.85]Who art all good and deserving of all my love.
[00:55.15]I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace
[00:58.35]To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life,
[01:03.94]And to avoid the temptations of evil.

[01:14.23]Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
[01:22.49]And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
[01:31.26]But most of all, because my God, I have offended Thee
[01:40.05]Who art all good
[01:42.22]Like I knew you would
[01:44.31]And deserving of all my love
[01:48.61]I reserve, I reserve, I reserve
[01:53.39]
[01:58.07]I reserve, I resolve
[02:03.86]I have a reservation
[02:07.15]I have a reservation!
