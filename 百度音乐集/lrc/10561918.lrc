[00:23.80]No one told me about her,
[00:27.52]the way she lied.
[00:30.98]Well, no one told me about her,
[00:34.72]how many people cried.
[00:37.53]But it's too late to say you're sorry.
[00:40.97]How would I know, why should I care?

[00:57.12]What could I do?

[01:04.33]though they all knew.
[01:07.32]But it's too late to say you're sorry.
