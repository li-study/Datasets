[00:04.42]
[00:11.46]I still think about how it used to be
[00:15.87]So entwined in my own lies, surrounded by this make believe
[00:22.07]I've been held by despondency
[00:26.58]I should have known the road I chose would run out on me (oh no)
[00:33.83]I could've faded
[00:34.77]Been jaded
[00:35.70]By every consequence
[00:36.61]Every word that you hurdled
[00:37.72]Was part of my defense
[00:39.11]You can hurt me
[00:40.04]Desert me
[00:40.54]It makes no difference
[00:42.17]I give as good as I get
[00:44.20]Like a weight falling from my shoulders
[00:46.38]I'm not going to go that way again (never going back)
[00:48.84]When everybody said that my days were over
[00:51.42]Wouldn't get the time to comprehend (you should've known that)
[00:54.00]You should've known it would make me stronger
[00:57.03]I was never gonna fade away (don't you know that)
[00:59.78]I keep it coming, my destiny aint running away from me
[01:04.29]And it's all so bittersweet
[01:07.26]
[01:10.84]In my life, I had no room for comprimise
[01:15.00]The things I've done have been the ones I have had to leave behind
[01:20.76]Look in my eyes, you barely recognise
[01:25.67]The woman who depended on you to sing a little praise or criticise (oh no)
[01:33.16]So I hide it
[01:33.90]Divide it
[01:34.55]Bout what I feel inside
[01:35.65]Now I take it
[01:36.37]Or make it
[01:37.06]I'm gonna be alright
[01:38.43]Whether you need me
[01:39.21]Believe me
[01:39.69]You'll never hurt my pride
[01:40.74]Finally all this feels like
[01:43.44]Like a weight falling from my shoulders
[01:45.56]I'm not going to go that way again (never going back)
[01:48.26]When everybody said that my days were over
[01:50.78]Would'nt get the time to comprehend (you should've known that)
[01:53.32]You should've known it would make me stronger
[01:56.30]I was never gonna fade away (don't you know that)
[01:59.15]I keep it coming, my destiny aint running away from me
[02:03.53]And it's all so bittersweet
[02:06.65]
[02:12.16]Look into my eyes
[02:14.56]I wont be left behind
[02:17.29]Everything's going to be fine
[02:21.11]And I have never felt like this
[02:23.60]I have no need to reminisce
[02:26.49]Those old days have gone
[02:29.12]And I keep holding on
[02:33.18]Like a weight falling from my shoulders
[02:35.26]I'm not going to go that way again (never going back)
[02:38.21]When everybody said that my days were over
[02:40.58]Would'nt get the time to comprehend (you should've known that)
[02:43.81]You should've known it would make me stronger
[02:46.17]I was never gonna fade away (don't you know that)
[02:48.81]I keep it coming, my destiny aint running away from me
[02:53.38]And it's all so bittersweet
[02:55.49]Like a weight falling from my shoulders
[02:56.95]I'm not going to go that way again (never going back)
[02:59.57]When everybody said that my days were over
[03:02.10]Would'nt get the time to comprehend (you should've known that)
[03:05.45]You should've known it would make me stronger
[03:08.10]I was never gonna fade away (don't you know that)
[03:11.30]I keep it coming, my destiny aint running away from me
[03:14.91]And it's all so bittersweet
[03:16.55]Like a weight falling from my shoulders
[03:18.55]I'm not going to go that way again (never going back)
[03:21.59]When everybody said that my days were over
[03:23.70]Would'nt get the time to comprehend (you should've known that)
[03:27.06]You should've known it would make me stronger
[03:29.37]I was never gonna fade away (don't you know that)
[03:33.08]I keep it coming, my destiny aint running away from me
[03:35.23]And it's all so bittersweet
