[00:06]Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed.
[00:21]Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.
[00:38]Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need.
[00:53]I say love, it is a flower, and you it's only seed.
[01:12]It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance.
[01:26]It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes a chance.
[01:41]It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give.
[01:56]And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live.
[02:15]When the night has been too lonely, and the road has been too long,
[02:28]And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong,
[02:43]Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows,
[02:57]Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes The Rose.
