[00:21.41]I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
[00:30.86]I wish I could break all the chains holding me
[00:40.91]I wish I could say all the things that I should say
[00:49.78]Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
[00:54.74]For the whole wide world to hear
[00:59.54]
[01:00.48]I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
[01:10.06]Remove all the bars that keep us apart
[01:19.31]And I wish you could know how it feels to be me
[01:28.88]Then you'd see and agree
[01:33.67]That every man should be free
[01:37.95]
[01:39.46]I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
[01:49.06]How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
[01:58.45]Well I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
[02:07.78]And I'd sing 'cos I'd know how it feels to be free
[02:17.57]I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
[02:27.24]I wish I could break all the chains holding me
[02:37.11]And I wish I could say all the things that I wanna say
[02:46.82]Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
[02:51.72]For the whole wide world to hear
[02:56.55]Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
[03:01.43]For the whole wide world to hear
[03:06.33]Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
[03:11.19]For the whole
[03:15.57]Wide world to hear
[03:18.51]
[03:37.69]One love
[03:39.82]One blood
[03:42.24]One life
[03:43.74]You got to do what you should
[03:47.11]One life
[03:49.50]With each other
[03:52.04]Sisters
[03:54.35]Brothers
[03:57.08]One life
[03:58.45]But we're not the same
[04:00.50]We get to carry each other
[04:03.46]Carry each other
[04:04.86]
[04:05.48]Woah, woah, woah, woah
[04:24.21]
[04:26.44]I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
[04:34.92]I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
