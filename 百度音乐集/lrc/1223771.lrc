[00:25.76]I don′t believe
[00:29.67]In the smile that you leave
[00:33.71]When you walk away
[00:36.39]And say goodbye
[00:39.88]Well I don′t expect
[00:44.13]The world to move underneath me
[00:47.74]But for God′s sake
[00:50.24]Could you try?
[00:54.39]I know that you′re true to me
[00:57.67]You′re always there
[00:59.36]You say you care
[01:01.08]I know that you want to be mine
[01:06.37]Where is your heart?
[01:09.44]′Cause I don′t really feel you
[01:13.20]Where is your heart?
[01:16.18]What I really want is to believe you
[01:19.80]Is it so hard
[01:22.69]To give me what I need?
[01:24.58]I want your heart to bleed
[01:27.96]That′s all I′m asking for
[01:31.60]Oh, where is your heart?
[01:37.50]I don′t understand
[01:41.47]Your love is so cold
[01:45.05]It′s always me that′s reaching out
[01:47.58]For your hand
[01:50.71]And I′ve always dreamed
[01:55.13]That love would be effortless
[01:58.41]Like a petal fallin′ to the ground
[02:00.16]A dreamer followin′ his dream
[02:03.89]Where is your heart?
[02:06.81]′Cause I don′t really feel you
[02:10.60]Where is your heart?
[02:13.58]What I really want is to believe you
[02:17.94]Is it so hard
[02:20.14]To give me what I need?
[02:21.92]I want your heart to bleed
[02:23.72]And that′s all I′m asking for
[02:28.75]Oh, where is your heart?
[02:36.51]It seems so much is left unsaid
[02:40.57]So much is left unsaid
[02:43.28]But you can say anything
[02:44.80]Oh, anytime you need
[02:49.13]Baby, it′s just you and me
[02:55.78]Oh yeah
[02:59.21]I know that you′re true to me
[03:02.58]You′re always there
[03:04.32]You say you care
[03:05.95]I know that you want to be mine
[03:11.28]Where is your heart?
[03:14.31]′Cause I don′t really feel you
[03:17.74]Where is your heart?
[03:21.05]What I really want is to believe you
[03:24.56]Is it so hard
[03:27.72]To give me what I need?
[03:29.44]I want your heart to bleed
