[00:46.44]Tangerine, she is all that they claim
[00:55.51]With her eyes of night
[00:57.32]And lips as bright as flame
[01:02.27]Tangerine, when she dances by
[01:09.65]Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
[01:17.59]And I\'ve seen toasts to Tangerine
[01:26.17]Raised in every bar across the Argentine
[01:33.51]Oh yes, she has them all on the run
[01:37.73]But her heart belongs to just one
[01:41.84]Her heart belongs to Tangerine
[01:52.90]
[03:32.05]Tangerine, she is all that they claim
[03:40.43]With her eyes of night
[03:42.98]And lips as bright as flame
[03:47.60]Tangerine, when she dances by
[03:55.87]Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
[04:03.20]And I\'ve seen toasts to Tangerine
[04:11.23]Raised in every bar across the Argentine
[04:18.13]Oh yes, she has them all on the run
[04:22.75]But her heart belongs to just one
[04:26.74]Her heart belongs to Tangerine
