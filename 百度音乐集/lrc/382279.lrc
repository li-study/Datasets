[00:10.50]Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
[00:18.00]and feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way.
[00:27.30]But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.
[00:37.50]So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.
[00:47.50]I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
[00:52.20]from up and down, and still somehow
[00:56.50]it's cloud illusions I recall.
[01:01.00]I really don't know clouds at all.
[01:17.50]Moons and Junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
[01:26.50]as every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
[01:36.00]But now it's just another show. You leave 'em laughing when you go
[01:45.50]and if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.
[01:55.50]I've looked at love from both sides now,
[01:59.50]from give and take, and still somehow
[02:03.50]it's love's illusions I recall.
[02:11.00]I really don't know love at all.
[02:26.00]Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud,
[02:34.50]dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.
[02:45.50]But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say
[02:53.50]I've changed.
[02:55.50]Something's lost but something's gained in living every day.
[03:04.50]I've looked at life from both sides now,
[03:09.50]from win and lose, and still somehow
[03:13.50]it's life's illusions I recall.
[03:18.00]I really don't know life at all.
