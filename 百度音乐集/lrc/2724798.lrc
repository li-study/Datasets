[00:03.42]
[00:10.77]There is a house in New Orleans
[00:17.09]They call the 'Rising Sun'
[00:23.45]And it's been the ruin of many a young poor boy
[00:29.24]And, God, I know I'm one
[00:34.58]
[00:45.00]My mother was a tailor
[00:51.05]Sewed my new blue jeans
[00:57.80]My father was a gamblin' man
[01:04.00]Down in New Orleans
[01:18.31]Now the only thing he ever needs
[01:25.47]Is a suitcase and a trunk
[01:31.83]And the only time he's satisfied
[01:37.56]Is when he's on a drunk
[01:42.14]
[02:25.91]Oh, Mother tell your children
[02:32.11]Not to do what I have done
[02:38.83]Spend your lives in sin and misery
[02:44.75]In the House of the Rising Sun
[02:50.00]
[02:59.70]With one foot on the platform
[03:05.72]And the other foot on the train
[03:11.84]I know he's back to New Orleans
[03:18.08]To wear that ball and chain
[03:22.63]
[03:31.92]Well there is a house in New Orleans
[03:39.03]They call the 'Rising Sun'
[03:45.20]And its been the ruin of many a young poor boy
[03:50.81]And, God, I know I'm one
[03:55.50]
