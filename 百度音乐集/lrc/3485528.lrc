[00:00.00]Tornado Of Souls
[00:18.50]
[00:24.27]This morning I made the call
[00:27.51]The one that ends it all
[00:30.06]Hanging up, I wanted to cry
[00:32.44]Bu dammit, this well's gone dry
[00:34.80]Not for the money, not for the fame
[00:39.70]Not for the power, just no more games
[00:44.69]But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
[00:49.48]I can't replace the lies, that let a 1000 days go
[00:54.82]No more living trapped inside
[00:57.35]In her way I'll surely die
[00:59.79]In the eye of the tornado, blow me away
[01:04.97]
[01:09.57]You'll grow to loathe my name
[01:11.77]You'll hate me just the same
[01:14.17]You won't need your breath
[01:16.72]And soon you'll meet your death
[01:19.43]Not from the years, not from the use
[01:23.99]Not from the tears, just self abuse
[01:28.94]
[01:29.09]But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
[01:34.16]I can't replace the lies, that let a 1000 days go
[01:39.12]No more living trapped inside
[01:41.83]In her way I'll surely die
[01:44.19]In the eye of the tornado, blow me away
[01:48.92]Who's to say what's for me to say
[01:53.78]Who's to say what's for me to be
[01:58.64]Who's to say what's for me to do
[02:03.67]Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
[02:07.87]
[02:40.30]The land of opportunity
[02:44.28]The golden chance for me
[02:46.61]My future looks so bright
[02:48.91]Now I think I've seen the light
[02:51.19]SOLO
[04:07.91]
[04:09.80]Can't say what's on my mind
[04:14.04]Can't do what I really feel
[04:18.99]In this bed I made for me
[04:24.01]Is where I sleep, I really feel
[04:29.30]
[04:39.11]I warn you of the fate
[04:41.53]Proven true to late
[04:44.14]Your tongue twist perverse
[04:46.52]Come drink now of this curse
[04:48.91]And now I fill your brain
[04:51.23]I spin you round again
[04:53.55]My poison fills your head
[04:56.10]As I tuck you into bed
[04:58.58]You feel my fingertips
[05:01.05]You won't forget my lips
[05:03.49]You'll feel my cold breath
[05:05.92]It's the kiss of death
[05:08.44]
