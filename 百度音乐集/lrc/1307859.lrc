[00:54.74]You were a child
[00:56.52]Crawling on your knees toward it
[01:01.99]Making momma so proud,
[01:05.98]But your voice is too loud
[01:07.97]
[01:12.03]We like to watch you laughing,
[01:17.35]You pick the insects off plants
[01:21.28]No time to think of consequences
[01:24.07]
[01:25.83]Control yourself
[01:27.60]Take only what you need from it

[02:08.32]Crying out for attention
[02:10.61]
[02:12.54]The memories fade
[02:14.44]Like looking through a fogged mirror
[02:19.27]Decision to decisions are made
[02:21.84]And not bought,
[02:23.14]But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot.
[02:25.76]I guess not
[02:26.72]
