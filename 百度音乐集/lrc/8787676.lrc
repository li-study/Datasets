[00:02.00]
[00:16.14]Keeping my distance
[00:18.95]I look but I don’t really see
[00:23.91]It’s like things lose their color
[00:26.90]And people are walking right through me
[00:32.28]To not pay attention
[00:35.39]Not easy to see what’s passing you by
[00:40.51]I gave it a try
[00:42.77]Did not see you coming my way
[00:46.83]
[00:48.83]Now you wanna hold my hand
[00:52.95]You chose to take it
[00:55.05]The truth is that I never really thought we’d make it
[00:59.17]Here we are
[01:01.23]No chance I’m leaving
[01:03.37]Ideas of love and life for sure can be deceiving
[01:07.43]Here we are now
[01:11.48]
[01:13.83]How come it just happened?
[01:16.65]By that moment I should've known
[01:21.92]A purpose of meeting
[01:24.87]Like then I did not believe you so
[01:30.21]Somehow you got to me
[01:33.19]Never again will I put up a fight
[01:38.41]When everything's right
[01:41.55]Finally everything's right
[01:45.77]
[01:46.88]Now you wanna hold my hand
[01:50.88]You chose to take it
[01:53.04]The truth is that I never really thought we’d make it
[01:57.20]Here we are
[01:59.23]No chance I’m leaving
[02:01.27]Ideas of love and life for sure can be deceiving
[02:05.46]Here we are now
[02:09.38]
[02:28.06]Now you wanna hold my hand
[02:32.38]You chose to take it
[02:34.36]The truth is that I never really thought we’d make it
[02:38.55]Here we are
[02:40.75]No chance I’m leaving
[02:42.71]Ideas of love and life for sure can be deceiving
[02:46.77]Hold my hand
[02:48.80]You chose to take it
[02:50.93]The truth is that I never really thought we’d make it
[02:55.02]Here we are
[02:56.94]No chance I’m leaving
[02:59.16]Ideas of love and life for sure can be deceiving
