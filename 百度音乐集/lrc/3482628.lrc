[00:00.20]演唱：Simon
[00:00.90]After all, the broken stones
[00:05.03]That were thrown, for no good reason
[00:11.41]Inside, she's loving him still
[00:15.80]After all this time
[00:19.35]And though her heart, begs the stars
[00:24.29]No sign of healing, It's All right
[00:29.38]She's loving him still, after all this time.
[00:35.59]Ohh yeahh
[00:39.30]Trying to push the past away
[00:41.54]Still waiting for the lights to change
[00:44.31]Try, try for the sake of it
[00:47.63]Pride  pride
[00:49.90]Learning to barely feel the pain
[00:52.58]Thicker the skin the less the strain
[00:55.22]And though it's really hurting
[00:57.28]She aint breaking, breaking, breaking
[01:01.46]Cos she's loving him still, after all this time
[01:17.60]Now he knows his weakness shows
[01:21.85]Selfish soul, never changing
[01:27.90]That's fine, because she's loving him still
[01:32.28]After all this time
[01:35.68]And to the outside eye
[01:38.17]You see you found a different guy
[01:40.67]And it all seems perfect, and that's how she wants it
[01:46.10]Cos she's loving him still, after all this time.
[01:55.30]Trying to push the past away
[01:58.52]Still waiting for the lights to change
[02:01.33]Try, try for the sake of it
[02:04.71]Pride pride
[02:06.92]Learning to barely feel the pain
[02:09.73]Thicker the skin the less the strain
[02:12.29]And though it's really hurting
[02:14.78]She aint breaking, breaking, breaking
[02:18.52]Cos she's loving him still, after all this time
[02:27.34]After all this time....
[02:30.90]After all, after all, after all this time
[02:43.89]Bones have to grow, and age it shows
[02:52.19]Though we try and hide it
[02:55.06]Inside, she's loving him still After all this time
[03:02.33]And behind his tired eyes, she sees the boy with his arms wide
[03:07.45]Who made her feel like an angel
[03:11.64]Ohh thats why she's loving him still
[03:15.73]For the rest of her life, she's loving him still
[03:21.47]For the last of many miles
[03:24.43]She's loving him still After all this time
