[00:01.00]Ride on
[00:06.00]Christy Moore
[00:15.00]
[00:35.78]True you ride the finest horse
[00:39.50]I\'ve ever seen
[00:42.96]Standing sixteen one or two
[00:47.74]With eyes wild and green
[00:51.47]You ride the horse so well
[00:56.52]Hands light to the touch
[00:59.81]I could never go with you
[01:04.54]No matter how I wanted to
[01:09.17]Ride on, see you
[01:19.21]I could never go with you
[01:21.78]No matter how I wanted to
[01:27.79]Ride on, see you
[01:34.96]I could never go with you
[01:39.00]No matter how I wanted to
[01:45.17]When you ride into the night
[01:48.39]Without out a trace behind
[01:52.29]Run your claw along my gush
[01:57.42]One last time
[02:02.31]I turn to face an empty space
[02:05.37]Where you used to lie
[02:08.62]And look for the spark that lights the night
[02:13.93]Through the teardrop in my eye
[02:19.43]Ride on, see you
[02:26.38]I could never go with you
[02:30.52]No matter how I wanted to
[02:35.33]Ride on, see you
[02:43.26]I could never go with you
[02:47.45]No matter how I wanted to
