[00:12.51]sweet rosalyn
[00:14.29]
[00:19.65]Slappin' leather was devised
[00:23.70]During a wild streak in her life
[00:26.91]She has a cheap apartment
[00:29.35]Up on Royal Street
[00:31.02]She brought home just enough
[00:33.26]To keep her on her feet
[00:38.32]She don't believe in anything
[00:46.81]But it you ask her, she'll say
[00:50.96]There's plenty of things to believe in
[00:54.44]Sweet Rosalyn
[00:58.32]Sometimes you gotta give in
[01:02.50]Sweet Rosalyn
[01:06.61]Sometimes you gotta give in
[01:10.70]Sometimes you gotta be loved
[01:16.27]
[01:21.63]She got a number off the bathroom wall
[01:24.70]She was looking for a good time so she made the call
[01:28.74]Got a strangely calm voice on the other line
[01:33.49]Sneaky little priest trying to reach out to the swine
[01:39.37]He said, "Hello my name is Father Tim
[01:48.53]Seems to me your zeal for this life
[01:52.84]Has been wearing a little thin"
[01:56.36]Sweet Rosalyn
[02:00.33]Sometimes you gotta give in
[02:04.58]Sweet Rosalyn
[02:08.50]Sometimes you gotta give in
[02:12.69]Sometimes you gotta be loved
[02:18.54]Chorus
[02:23.21]
[02:32.09]Well, maybe we all could use a little grace
[02:40.25]To know when to run and when to
[02:44.90]Stay in one place
[02:48.03]Sweet Rosalyn
[02:52.03]Sometimes you gotta give in
[02:56.30]Sweet Rosalyn
[03:00.26]Sometimes you gotta give in
[03:13.42]Sweet Rosalyn
[03:16.84]Sometimes you gotta give in
[03:21.10]Sweet Rosalyn
[03:23.13]Sometimes you gotta give in
[03:25.75]Sometimes you gotta be loved
