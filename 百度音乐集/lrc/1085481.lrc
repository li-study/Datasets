[00:17.78]One touch that was all it took
[00:20.82]And I was hypnotized
[00:25.87]One look that was just enough
[00:29.01]To loose myself inside of you
[00:34.18]I wish I could stop the time
[00:37.32]To love you day and night
[00:42.37]That one night was just too short
[00:45.43]I wanna do it one more time
[02:15.16][00:50.78]I know you're with someone else
[02:19.67][00:54.85]I knew it was a one night stand
[02:22.77][00:57.97]But never the less
[02:24.56][00:59.83]Without the stress
[02:26.98][01:02.06]Let's do it once again
[03:25.96][02:32.19][01:07.27]I wish I could turn back the time
[03:30.12][02:36.18][01:11.34]Lay your body next to mine
[03:34.31][02:40.34][01:15.51]Love you for the second time
[03:37.56][02:43.72][01:18.74]One more night with you
[03:42.48][02:48.70][01:23.83]I wish I could just stop the time
[03:46.51][02:52.63][01:27.87]Play the button  press rewind
[04:07.03][03:50.80][02:56.97][01:32.01]Love you for the second time
[04:12.41][03:53.91][03:00.25][01:35.43]One more night
[01:42.39]It's just like we've met before
[01:45.65]It feels like da vu
[01:50.69]I'm longing real bad for you
[01:53.79]I'll pay the price to be your fool
[01:59.00]And sell my soul for what you like
[02:03.09]And trade it in for one more night
[02:06.35]Because one night is way too short
[02:10.27]I want some more  And that's for sure
[03:05.01]One touch  One night
[03:09.34]That special part of mine
[03:13.58]One love is alright
[03:16.93]One more night
