[00:24.94]Well met, well met, said an old true love
[00:31.04]Well met, well met, said he
[00:37.13]I just returned from the salt, salt sea
[00:43.00]And its all for the love of thee
[00:47.84]
[00:48.89]Come in, come in, my own true love
[00:54.47]And have a seat by me
[01:00.74]Its been three-fourths of a long, long year
[01:05.28]Since together we have been
[01:12.50]
[01:33.24]I cant come in and i can't sit down
[01:39.69]For ive only a moments time
[01:45.20]They say youre married to a house carpenter
[01:50.10]And your heart will never be mine
[01:56.33]I couldve married the kings daughter fair
[02:03.31]And she wouldve married me
[02:08.12]But i have forsaken her crowns of gold
[02:14.79]And it's all for the love of thee
[02:20.27]
[02:41.77]Now will you forsake your house carpenter
[02:47.70]And come along with me
[02:53.98]I'll take you where, the grass grows green
[02:59.95]On the banks of the deep blue sea
[03:04.86]Then she picked up her darling little babe
[03:11.44]And kisses she gave it three
[03:17.12]Saying stay right here you darling little babe
[03:23.06]And keep your pop company
[03:29.13]
[03:52.03]They had not been on the ship two weeks
[04:00.07]I'm sure it was not three
[04:05.45]Til this true love began to weep and to mourn
[04:11.34]And she wept most bitterly
[04:16.77]Saying are you weeping for my silver and my gold?
[04:22.66]Saying are you weeping for my store?
[04:29.10]Or are you weeping, for your house carpenter
[04:34.70]Whose face youll never see no more?
[04:40.82]A curse, a curse to the sailor, she cried
[04:45.83]A curse, a curse, she swore
[04:52.49]You robbed me of the darling little babe
[04:58.40]That i shall never see no more
[05:03.38]
[05:04.35]They had not been on the ship three weeks
[05:09.86]Im sure it was not four
[05:16.01]When there came a leak, in the bottom of the ship
[05:22.16]And sank them for to rise no more
