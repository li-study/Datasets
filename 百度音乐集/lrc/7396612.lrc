[00:21.03]It's getting so lonely inside this bed
[00:26.51]Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say 'woe is me' instead
[00:32.60]And there's an aching inside my head
[00:38.37]It's telling me you're better off alone
[00:42.38]After midnight
[00:45.51]Morning will come
[00:47.71]And the day will see
[00:50.98]If you will get some
[01:46.14][00:53.25]They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
[01:48.94][00:55.82]Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
[01:51.93][00:58.35]They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
[01:54.27][01:00.80]Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
[01:57.08][01:03.59]And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
[01:59.82][01:06.51]'Til you see all my dreams
[02:02.52][01:09.39]Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
[01:15.12]I looked above the other day
[01:19.73]Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change
[01:25.28]I live my life by the moon (by the moon)
[01:30.52]If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
[01:35.50]But after midnight
[01:38.69]Morning will come
[01:41.03]And the day will see, yeah
[01:44.16]If you're gonna get some
[02:10.54]I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
[02:13.07]Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
[02:15.59]I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
[02:18.32]That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
[02:21.27]I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
[02:23.75]Where is the love that I'm looking to find
[02:26.38]It's all in me, can't you see
[02:28.26]Why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me
[02:52.00]Where is your logic (turn off the light, turn off the light)
[02:58.27]Who do you need (turn off the light, turn off the light)
[03:04.12]And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down

[03:19.73][03:14.36]Follow me follow me down down down down
[03:22.21][03:17.11]I do not need I do not need nobody (turn off the light, turn off the light)
[03:24.99]Follow me follow me follow me down down down
[03:27.75]'Til you see all my dreams
[03:30.39]Follow me follow me follow me down down down
