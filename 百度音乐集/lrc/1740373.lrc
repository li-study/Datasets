[00:00.00][04:20.00]Babyface--The Day (That You Gave Me A Son)
[00:18.00]’T was late December the news came
[00:30.00]And I got so excited, I cried all day
[00:43.00]And you were such a lovely, precious sight
[00:52.00]When I saw our baby in your eyes
[01:00.00][02:17.00][03:30.00]It was like falling deep in love
[01:07.00][02:24.00][03:38.00]I heard the angels cry above
[01:14.00][02:31.00][03:45.00]I felt a blessing straight from God
[01:21.00][02:38.00][03:52.00]The day that you gave me a son
[01:35.00]I called ’bout everyone I knew
[01:46.00]Just think, I’ll be a father ’cause of you
[02:00.00]There’s no greater love than what you gave
[02:10.00]A brand new baby on the way
[02:57.00]Oh such tears of joy, I’ve never known
[03:05.00]I can’t remember
[03:09.00]It’s like a song, I’ve never heard
[03:16.00]I’ve never sung, but know the words
