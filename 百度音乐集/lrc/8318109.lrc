[00:00.72]Seven hours since you went away
[00:04.81]Eleven coffees, Rickki Lake on play
[00:08.71]But late at night when I'm feeling blue
[00:12.67]I'd sell my ass before I think of you
[00:16.50]Seven hours since you closed the door
[00:20.29]Started a diet, got a manicure
[00:24.02]Erased your number from my telephone
[00:27.68]And if you call me I won't be at home
[00:30.72]
[00:31.06]He said:
[00:31.52]Bridge
[00:32.27]Why don't you cry
[00:33.75]For the day
[00:35.60]Say goodbye
[00:37.63]Runaway
[00:39.16]Why don't you cry
[00:41.34]For the day
[00:43.14]Say goodbye
[00:45.13]I said ok, 'cos...
[Chorus]
[00:46.89]Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
[00:49.97]Because I do boy,
[00:52.03]And it's cool boy
[00:54.01]And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
[00:57.61]Because of you boy,
[00:59.49]Such a fool boy
[01:03.91]
[01:06.40]Eleven hours on a brand new day
[01:10.03]I'm getting ready to go out and play
[01:13.75]It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
[01:17.66]I'd kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
[01:21.61]Seven hours, what you calling for?
[01:25.33]A bunch of flowers and I slam the door
[01:29.18]You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
[01:32.84]Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
[01:36.22]'cos...
[Chorus]
[01:36.93]Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head
[01:39.97]Because I do boy,
[01:41.81]And it's cool boy
[01:43.95]And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
[01:47.50]Because of you boy,
[01:49.44]Such a fool boy
[01:51.41]
[01:52.24]I'm through with it
[01:53.49]Over it

[02:02.99]Not feeling it
[02:04.04]Can't deal with it
[02:04.95]No more, I quit
[02:05.86]No more, no more
[02:07.83]Breaking off the ...
[02:09.14]A brand new day has just begun
[02:11.57]Just because you made me go "ooh"
[02:13.64]Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
[02:15.41]Don't you dare come back
[02:17.25]Can't u see I wont take that?

[02:21.15]Better fill your head up like I told you
