[00:00.00]The Shores of the Swilly
[00:41.17]By the shores of the Swilly,
[00:45.79]two children at play
[00:50.20]The king of the castle,
[00:54.23]the queen of the may
[00:59.39]Just me and my sister,
[01:03.64]in a world of pretend
[01:07.75]Where the sun would keep shining,
[01:12.19]the day never end
[01:22.66]By the shores of the Swilly,
[01:27.06]now with kids of our own
[01:31.45]Another year over,
[01:35.57]and see how they've grown
[01:40.81]Then we'd watch the last sunset,
[01:45.60]and walk arm in arm
[01:49.43]Till I see you next summer;
[01:53.34]God keep you from harm
[01:59.68]And if I was a flier
[02:04.23]who crashed now and then,
[02:08.53]she would put me together
[02:12.87]and fly me again.
[02:23.07]
[02:56.81]And if I was a flier
[03:00.73]who crashed now and then,
[03:04.96]she would put me together
[03:09.20]and fly me again.
[03:15.40]By the shores of the Swilly,
[03:20.69]with an aching inside
[03:25.40]I'll watch as her body
[03:29.79]is raised from the tide...
[03:37.03]Her life has been taken,
[03:41.66]and I'll never know why
[03:49.06]but I feel in that moment,
[03:54.87]a part of me died...
