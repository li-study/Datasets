[00:12.00]Don't wanna let this moment slip away
[00:15.53]Cause I-I have something that I really need to say
[00:21.30]And it's killing me inside
[00:23.98]I think that you don't understand
[00:27.14]How I-I would give you all I have and all I am
[00:33.17]Till the end of time
[00:35.55]You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless
[00:41.17]You cut me so deeply, I must confess
[00:45.91]Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
[00:51.80]Baby it kills me, cause now that I found you
[00:57.87]Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
[01:03.65]You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart

[01:25.86]Cause I-I get dizzy when your body's touching mine
[01:31.68]Girl you're killing me inside
[01:34.10]The way you move is much too sexy baby
[01:37.58]So I-I surrender to your hands, your lips, your taste
[01:43.27]And I'm telling you tonight
[01:45.71]You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless
[01:51.46]You cut me so deeply, I must confess
[01:56.15]Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
[02:02.10]Baby it kills me, cause now that I found you
[02:08.15]Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
[02:13.90]You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart

[02:36.90]Girl you hurt me and changed from the start
[02:44.00]I'm just a witness to the scene of my fate
[02:48.46]And the way you've been slaying my heart
[02:53.88]
[02:54.89]Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
[03:00.60]Baby it kills me, cause now that I found you
