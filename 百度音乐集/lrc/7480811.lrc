[00:39.55]I'm screaming revenge again
[00:43.74]Wrong
[00:47.18]I've been wrong for far too long
[00:50.03]Been constantly so frustrated
[00:53.28]I've moved mountains with less
[00:56.17]When I channel my hate to productive
[00:59.34]I don't find it hard to impress

[01:02.40]Bones in traction
[01:05.84]Hands break to hone raw energy
[01:08.81]Bold and disastrous

[01:55.03]And my soul lies in every one
[01:58.09]The releasing of anger
[02:00.82]can better any medicine under the sun

[02:30.80]
[02:57.00]There comes a time within everyone
[03:03.34]to close your eyes to what's real
[03:12.91]
[03:16.01]No comprehension to fail
[03:18.68]I vacuum the wind for my sail
[03:21.53]Can't be the rest Let others waste my time
[03:24.93]Owning success is the bottom line.
[03:29.03]Like a knife into flesh
[03:32.54]After life is to death
[03:35.83]Pulling and punching the rest of duration
