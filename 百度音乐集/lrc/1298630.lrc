[00:14.50]These walls have eyes
[00:20.38]Rows of photographs
[00:23.05]And faces like mine
[00:26.57]Who do we become
[00:33.35]Without knowing where
[00:35.89]We started from
[00:46.52]It\'s true I\'m missing you
[00:52.56]As I stand alone in your room
[01:05.41]Everyday that will pass you by
[01:11.69]Every name that you won\'t recall
[01:18.10]
[01:24.44]Everything that you know by heart
[01:30.93]And I will try to connect
[01:34.84]All the pieces you left
[01:38.08]I will carry it on
[01:41.52]And let you forget
[01:43.82]And I\'ll remember the years
[01:47.24]When your mind was clear
[01:49.92]How the laughter and life
[01:54.18]Filled up this silent house
[02:09.36]One room
[02:12.19]Two single beds
[02:15.49]In the closet hangs
[02:18.21]Your favorite dress
[02:22.28]The books that you read
[02:28.16]Are in scattered piles
[02:30.94]Of paper shreds
[02:40.82]
[02:47.24]Everything that you know by heart
[02:53.82]And I will try to connect
[02:57.08]All the pieces you left
[03:00.08]I will carry it on
[03:04.26]And let you forget
[03:06.49]And I\'ll remember the years
[03:09.86]When your mind was clear
[03:13.19]How the laughter and life
[03:16.65]Filled up this silent house
[03:24.51]Silent house
[03:45.28]In the garden off the living room
[03:50.86]A chill fills the air
[03:54.45]And the lilies bloom
[03:59.60]And I will try to connect
[04:03.27]All the pieces you left
[04:06.23]I will carry it on
[04:09.66]And let you forget
[04:12.78]And I\'ll remember the years
[04:15.62]When your mind was clear
[04:19.01]How the laughter and life
[04:22.72]Filled up this
[04:25.37]And I will try to connect
[04:28.26]All the pieces you left
[04:31.49]I will carry it on
[04:35.34]And let you forget
[04:38.17]And I\'ll remember the years
[04:41.42]When your mind was clear
[04:44.69]How the laughter and life
[04:48.42]Filled up this silent house
[04:56.50]Silent house
[04:57.71]
