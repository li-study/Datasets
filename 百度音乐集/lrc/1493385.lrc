[00:01.59]Trains and Winter Rains
[00:05.32]Enya(恩雅)
[00:10.55]
[00:11.85]City Streets passing by
[00:21.88]Underneath stormy skies.
[00:34.32]Neon signs in the night
[00:39.36]Red and blue city lights
[00:44.28]Cargo trains rolling by
[00:49.32]Once again someone cries
[00:56.97]Trains and winter rains
[01:00.51]No going by, no going home.
[01:06.67]Trains across the plains,
[01:10.65]And in the sky, the star alone.
[01:17.12]La la la
[01:22.28]Everytime, it’s the same.
[01:27.01]One more night, one more train.
[01:31.99]Everywhere empty roads,
[01:37.03]Where they go, no one knows.
[01:44.84]Trains and winter rains,
[01:48.45]No going by, no going home.
[01:54.55]Trains across the plains,
[01:59.16]And in the sky, the star alone.
[02:04.82]Trains and winter rains,
[02:08.62]No going by, no going home.
[02:14.59]Trains across the plains,
[02:18.45]And in the sky, the star alone.
[02:24.73]La la la
[02:28.21]Da da da da da … da da da da da da da
[02:47.53]Trains and winter rains,
[02:51.45]No going by, no going home.
[02:57.17]Trains across the plains
[03:01.09]And in the sky, the star alone
[03:07.52]Trains and winter rains,
[03:11.31]No going by, no going home
[03:17.61]Trains across the plains
[03:21.35]And in the sky, the star alone
