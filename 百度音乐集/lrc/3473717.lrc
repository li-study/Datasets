[00:00.97]Who Cares?
[00:11.07]
[00:30.57]Staring at the sky,
[00:36.33]There's angels in the snow.
[00:42.39]Wishing she could fly high,
[00:47.40]Above the world below.
[00:52.30]
[00:53.57]All that she wanted,
[00:56.70]Is to be wanted.
[01:06.59]She's sitting on the stairs,
[01:09.75]With ribbons in her hair,
[01:12.70]Waiting for someone who cares,
[01:21.24]Who cares.
[01:29.51]
[01:30.81]Pouring over magazines,
[01:37.06]She soaks up every page.
[01:43.12]Each picture like a daydream,
[01:49.22]She never wants to fade.
[01:53.44]
[01:54.07]All that she wanted,
[01:59.95]Is to be wanted.
[02:06.04]She's looking in the mirror,
[02:10.85]Wondering what to wear,
[02:13.78]Hoping she'll meet someone who cares,
[02:20.61]
[02:20.74]At the window sill, she's looking out on,
[02:26.39]Strawberry daffodils,
[02:30.31]Butterflies and broken roller skates,
[02:36.66]The colours bleed like finger paint.
[02:40.64]Yesterday...
[02:43.13]
[02:43.28]All that she wanted,
[02:48.43]Is to be wanted.
[02:56.11]She's rocking in a chair,
[02:59.13]Silver in her hair, still waiting for someone...
[03:07.27]All that she wanted,
[03:12.98]Is to be wanted.
[03:20.30]She's sitting on the stairs,
[03:24.03]Ribbons in her hair,
[03:26.71]Waiting for someone who cares,
[03:35.63]Who cares.
