[00:13.83]I thought I saw a man brought to life
[00:18.56]He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
[00:24.14]He showed me what it was to cry
[00:27.50]Well you couldn't be that man I adored
[00:33.28]You don't seem to know, don't seem to care what your heart is for
[00:39.10]But I don't know him anymore
[00:41.56]There's nothing where he used to lie
[00:44.31]My conversation has run dry
[00:47.63]That's whats going on, nothing's fine I'm torn
[00:52.65]I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
[00:57.84]I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
[01:02.65]Illusion never changed into something real
[01:07.76]I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
[01:12.56]You're a little late, I'm already torn
[01:18.01]
[01:23.40]So I guess the fortune teller's right
[01:28.33]Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
[01:33.96]To crawl beneath my veins and now
[01:36.44]I don't care, I have no luck, I don't miss it all that much
[01:42.18]There's just so many things that I can't touch, I'm torn
[01:47.57]I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
[01:52.65]I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
[01:57.32]Illusion never changed into something real
[02:02.59]I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
[02:07.53]You're a little late, I'm already torn. Torn.
[02:17.91]
[02:31.24]There's nothing where he used to lie
[02:33.92]My inspiration has run dry
[02:37.17]That's what's going on, nothings right, I'm torn
[02:42.37]I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
[02:47.40]I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
[02:52.23]Illusion never changed into something real
[02:57.40]I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
[03:02.37]I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
[03:07.39]I'm cold and I'm ashamed bound and broken on the floor
[03:12.23]You're a little late, I'm already torn.
