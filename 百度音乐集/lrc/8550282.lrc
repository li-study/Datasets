[05:13.75][00:10.70]Pink Floyd: Wish You Were Here
[03:57.39][00:41.11]
[01:35.53]So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
[01:50.36]Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, A smile from a veil?
[02:03.11]Do you think you can tell?
[02:06.68]
[02:07.32]And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts, Hot ashes for trees?
[02:19.34]Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?
[02:27.42]And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
[02:39.78]
[03:17.37]How I wish, how I wish you were here.
[03:23.80]We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
[03:33.16]Running over the same old ground.
[03:37.09]What have you found? The same old fears.
[03:43.09]Wish you were here.
