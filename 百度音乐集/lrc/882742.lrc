[00:11.17]If my man was fighting
[00:15.37]Some unholy war
[00:18.56]I would be behind him
[00:21.84]Straight shook up beside him
[00:26.23]With strength he didn't know
[00:29.52]It's you I'm fighting for
[00:33.51]He can't lose with me in tow
[00:38.70]I refuse to let him go
[00:44.19]At his side and drunk on pride
[00:49.48]We wait for the blow
[00:56.06]We put it in writing
[00:59.05]But who you writing for
[01:02.05]Just us on kitchen floor
[01:05.05]Justice done,
[01:07.14]Reciting my stomach standing still
[01:13.02]Like you're reading my will
[01:17.21]He still stands in spite of what his scars say
[01:22.20]I'll battle till this bitter finale
[01:27.88]Just me, my dignity and this guitar case
[01:38.95]Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
[01:46.04]And I will stand beside you
[01:51.33]Who you fighting for
[01:55.12]B - I would have died too
[01:58.11]I'd of liked to
[01:59.91]If my man was fighting
[02:05.20]Some unholy war
[02:09.59]If my man was fighting
