[00:13.76]Touch my heart
[00:17.00]And feel the warmth inside of me
[00:21.08]Hold me close
[00:23.36]Cause you set the fire burning
[00:27.80]Take a breath
[00:30.11]And know that love is reaching out to you
[00:36.31]
[02:27.77][01:36.24][00:39.43]When you smile
[02:31.92][01:40.30][00:43.23]A light shines in your eye
[02:34.26][01:42.67][00:46.01]When you smile
[02:38.27][01:46.72][00:50.03]A rainbow fills the sky
[02:41.28][01:49.65][00:52.97]When I'm felling blue
[02:42.95][01:51.37][00:54.70]Cause the skies are grey
[02:45.01][01:53.32][00:56.67]I think of you
[02:46.35][01:54.70][00:58.01]And they melt away
[02:47.94][01:56.29][00:59.67]There is love
[02:49.66][01:58.04][01:01.40]There is joy
[03:01.03][02:54.52][02:02.83][01:02.98]When you smile
[03:06.17][02:58.54][02:07.20][01:06.36]
[01:10.33]Blow a kiss
[01:13.32]To all the stars you see tonight
[01:17.71]Make a wish
[01:19.96]The dream becomes reality
[01:24.13]Call my name
[01:26.73]I'll be there if ever you should fall
[01:32.67]
