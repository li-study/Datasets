[00:07.56]
[00:13.49]Well I've been here before
[00:17.94]Sat on the floor in a grey grey room
[00:26.14]Where I stay in all day
[00:29.40]I don't eat
[00:30.79]but I play with this grey grey food
[00:38.92]
[00:40.88]Désolé
[00:43.08]if someone is prayin' then I might break out,
[00:53.98]Désolé
[00:56.47]even if I scream I can't scream that loud
[01:06.71]
[01:07.90]I'm all alone again
[01:14.70]Crawling back home again
[01:21.12]Stuck by the phone again

[01:29.20]Well I've been here before
[01:33.69]Sat on a floor in a grey grey mood
[01:42.64]Where I stay up all night
[01:45.99]And all that I write is a grey grey tune
[01:55.14]
[01:56.96]So pray for me child, just for a while
[02:02.26]That I might break out yeah
[02:10.03]Pray for me child
[02:12.52]Even a smile would do for now
[02:20.40]
[02:23.87]'Cause I'm all alone again
[02:30.65]Crawling back home again
[02:36.92]Stuck by the phone again

[02:56.61]Have I still got you to be my sandy shore
[03:11.30]Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm
[03:24.10]Have I still got you to keep me warm
[03:34.29]
[03:37.05]If I squeeze my grape
[03:41.52]and I drink my wine
[03:47.67]Coz if I squeeze my grape and
[03:54.07]and I drink my wine
[04:01.49]Oh coz nothing is lost
[04:04.81]it's just frozen in frost,
[04:07.92]And it's opening time

[04:14.10]But I've still got me to be your open door
