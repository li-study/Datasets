[00:-1.00]Emily Osment - Found Out About You

[00:00.01]
[00:05.83]We were picture perfect,
[00:08.54]Flawless on the surface.
[00:11.25]We were walking on a straight line.
[00:16.61]We were automatic.
[00:19.33]You seemed so fanatic.
[00:22.06]I was confident and wide-eyed.
[00:26.94]
[00:27.58]Tough times watched us come undone.
[00:33.33]You found someone.
[00:36.46]
[00:36.56]Tell me what I think about you.
[00:39.24]And tell me if you think about me.
[00:42.02]And tell me when you touch her,
[00:44.19]Is it really love or just another fantasy?
[00:47.60]And tell me does she make you laugh?
[00:49.94]And tell me does she make you move?
[00:52.70]And tell me does she get you?
[00:54.25]Take away your breath?
[00:55.28]Just tell me that it can't be true
[00:58.03]What I found out about you.
[01:01.60]
[01:05.32]It feels like a nightmare
[01:07.92]To see your hands in her hair.
[01:10.64]You seem happy ever after.
[01:15.94]I'm stuck in denial.
[01:18.62]I can't fake a smile.
[01:21.29]You play innocent.
[01:23.97]It's so damn hard.
[01:26.62]
[01:27.28]So down
[01:29.34]I want back what's mine.
[01:32.75]Can we rewind?
[01:35.95]
[01:36.37]Tell me what I think about you.
[01:38.45]And tell me if you think about me.
[01:41.16]And tell me when you touch her,
[01:42.92]Is it really love or just another fantasy?
[01:46.46]And tell me does she make you laugh?
[01:49.12]And tell me does she make you move?
[01:51.96]And tell me does she get you?
[01:53.35]Take away your breath?
[01:54.62]Just tell me that it can't be true
[01:57.13]What I found out about you.
[01:59.27]
[01:59.75]So much for happy endings
[02:01.82]So much for miracles
[02:04.50]So much for trusting you
[02:06.80]And it feels so typical
[02:09.65]I miss you.
[02:11.90]I miss you.
[02:16.39]
[02:26.26]We were picture perfect,
[02:28.84]Flawless on the surface.
[02:31.41]We were walking on a straight line.
[02:35.86]
[02:36.71]Tell me what I think about you.
[02:39.07]And tell me if you think about me.
[02:41.80]And tell me when you touch her,
[02:43.23]Is it really love or just another fantasy?
[02:47.23]And tell me does she make you laugh?
[02:49.91]And tell me does she make you scream?
[02:52.59]And tell me it's over,
[02:55.38]It's only a dream
[02:57.93]What I found out about you.
[03:00.18]
[03:00.80](It's over, it's only a dream)
[03:03.65]And tell me does she get you?
[03:04.90]Take away your breath?
[03:06.30]Just tell me that it can't be true
[03:08.73]What I found out about you.
[03:10.91]
[03:11.45](It's over, it's only a dream)
[03:14.29]And tell me does she get you?
[03:15.70]Take away your breath?
[03:16.86]Just tell me that it can't be true
[03:19.45]What I found out about you.
