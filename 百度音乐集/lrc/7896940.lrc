[00:12.61]Lysdal-A Matter Of Time
[00:20.48]It's five in the morning
[00:24.39]I'm sitting on my bed
[00:26.22]Ain't got a thouhgt running through my head
[00:33.10]I'm just a state of mind
[00:40.82]Sometimes I wonder
[00:43.00]What will become of me
[00:46.05]Will I return to the deep blue sea?
[00:52.98]It's maybe just a matter of time
[00:58.34]And if you belive in a life at first sight
[01:04.25]There are reasons enough not to fight
[01:08.05]Oh oh oh oh why do we fight?
[01:19.08]Oh oh oh oh we're blocking the light
[01:32.46]Why do you struggle?
[01:34.66]Why do you feel this woe?
[01:37.82]Why do you things that hunt you so?
[01:44.71]Baby just look up to the sky
[01:52.68]The reasons I ask you
[01:54.58]Is because I know
[01:57.56]You always wanted to have that flow
[02:04.32]Baby just you close your eyes
[02:09.96]And if you believe in a life at first sight
[02:15.51]There are reasons enough not to fight
[02:19.59]Oh oh oh oh why do we fight?
[03:38.93]It's five in the morning
[03:41.52]I'm sitting on my bed
[03:44.25]Ain't got a thouhgt running through my head
[03:50.94]I'm just a state of mind
[03:58.67]Sometimes I wonder
[04:00.86]What will become of me
[04:03.60]Will I return to the deep blue sea?
[04:10.34]It's maybe just a matter of time
[04:15.12]And if you believe in love at first sight
[04:21.11]There are reasons enough not to fight
[04:25.52]Oh oh oh oh why do we fight?
[04:34.63]Oh oh oh oh why do we fight?
[04:44.57]Oh oh oh oh we're blocking the light
