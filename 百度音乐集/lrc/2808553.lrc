[00:25.06]I don't wanna wake up today
[00:27.56]Cause everyday's the same
[00:29.47]And I've been waiting so long
[00:32.00]For things to change
[00:34.19]I'm sick of this town
[00:35.73]Sick of my job
[00:36.78]Sick of my friends
[00:37.77]Cause everyone's jaded
[00:39.08]Sick of this place

[00:57.44][01:47.49][02:42.03]Let's go, whoa!

[01:06.00]I don't wanna wake up one day
[01:08.45]And find out it's too late
[01:10.43]To do all the things I wanna do
[01:14.96]So I'm gonna pack up my bags
[01:17.58]I'm never coming back
[01:19.54]Cause the years are passing by
[01:21.89]And I'm wasting all my ti-time
[01:24.58]I'm sick of this house
[01:25.74]I'm sick of being broke
[01:26.81]I'm sick of this town that's bringing me down
[01:29.12]I'm sick of this place
[02:10.68][02:14.36][02:18.90](I can't take it anymore)
[02:21.77][02:23.57](Can't take it, can't take it)
[02:26.10][02:48.67]Forget tomorrow
