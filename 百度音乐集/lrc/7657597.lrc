[03:02.74][02:10.10][02:04.24][01:45.55][01:20.95][01:06.04][00:46.52][00:20.93][00:08.00]
[00:10.60]She was stormin' through the house that day,
[00:13.47]An' I could tell she was leavin'.
[00:15.76]An' I thought: "Aw, she'll be back,"
[00:18.25]Till she turned around an' pointed at the wall an said:
[00:22.89]"That picture from our honeymoon,
[00:26.14]"That night in Frisco Bay:
[01:43.09][01:30.04][00:41.54][00:29.59]"Just give it away."
[02:57.51][02:45.01][01:39.75][00:31.64]She said: "Give it away."
[00:35.88]"An' that big four-poster king-size bed,
[00:38.75]"Where so much love was made:
[00:44.15]She said: "Just give it away."
[01:46.58][00:47.95]"Just give it away.
[01:50.50][00:51.98]"There ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over.
[01:56.64][00:58.29]"Oh, an' we're both tired of fightin' anyway,
[02:02.59][01:04.21]"So just give it away."
[01:12.07]So I tried to move on,
[01:13.98]But I found that each woman I held,
[01:16.45]Just reminded me of that day.
[01:18.66]Hmmm.
[01:21.65]When that front door swung wide open,
[01:24.60]She flung her diamond ring:
[01:27.02]Said: "Give it away."
[01:33.74]An' I said: "Now, honey, don't you even want,
[01:38.13]"Your half of everything."
[02:09.43]::: Instrumental Break ::::
[02:30.17]So I'm still right here where she left me,
[02:33.09]Along with all the other things,
[02:34.37]She don't care about anymore.
[02:34.95]Mmmm.
[02:38.55]Like that picture from our honeymoon,
[02:42.22]That night in Frisco Bay:
[03:00.32][02:47.43]Well, I can't give it away.
[02:51.99]An' that big four-poster king-size bed,
[02:55.42]Where all our love was made:
[03:04.90]I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring,
[03:09.28]An' a lonely broken heart,
[03:12.51]Full of love,
[03:15.10]An' I can't even give it away.
