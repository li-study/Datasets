[00:00.00]Sky Sailing - Tennis Elbow
[00:15.00]
[00:29.90]Oh...
[00:32.50]Cell phones and travel stations
[00:36.26]Ringtones and new relations
[00:40.51]Say hello to all your friends for me
[00:48.51]Several calls are made to Thailand
[00:52.46]Wound up in Prince Edward Island
[00:56.45]And my head feels like it's ready to blow
[01:03.14]
[01:20.50]I served and scratched a rainbow
[01:24.57]So curved, I felt the pain go
[01:28.47]Through my joints
[01:30.41]And now I don't wanna play
[01:36.41]Swinging down, I sent the birdie
[01:40.53]Downtown, At 7:30
[01:44.04]And I'm convinced that I've got tennis elbow
[01:52.10]
[02:08.53]We are lost in the sound
[02:16.47]Close your eyes, and I will twirl you around
[02:24.19]We are lost in the sound
[02:32.01]Close your eyes, and I will twirl you around
[02:40.55]We are lost in the sound
[02:48.49]Close your eyes, and I will twirl you around
[02:55.55]
