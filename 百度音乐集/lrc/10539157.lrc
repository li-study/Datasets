[00:14.48]True Blessing (What )
[00:20.29]I was riding in my car one day
[00:24.81]In the express lane
[00:26.51]Rolling on the freeway
[00:29.94]And suddenly the phone rings
[00:32.70]And then I reached down beside me
[00:35.08]Then I looked on the floor
[00:36.55]Felt on the backsteat
[00:38.62]See I was drinking (whoa)
[00:40.84]While I was driving (whoa)
[00:43.07]Never thinking (whoa)
[00:45.21]About what I was doing (whoa)
[00:47.78]I turned around (whoa)
[00:50.12]And before I knew it (whoa)
[00:52.38]Here comes this truck now
[00:56.03]The doctor said "I don't think he's going to make it"
[00:58.33]Family said "make the funeral arrangements"
[01:00.82]Unplug the machine he's gone now
[01:03.20]Then told my wife to be strong now
[01:05.87]Then a small voice said unto me
[01:07.99]If you promise to stop drinking
[01:10.28]I surrendered on that day
[01:12.33]Now for ten years I been straight

[01:35.25]Now I been sitting in this chair
[01:36.80]Waiting on the phone to ring
[01:38.72]Praying up to God
[01:40.42]That someone would call me with a job opening
[01:43.32]Cuz it's been so hard for me months and months
[01:47.43]Struggling to eat
[01:49.46]But still there was no answer
[01:52.48]I stopped believing in his word
[01:55.00]And got so mad at him
[01:56.81]And when somebody said God's good
[01:58.47]I just laugh at him
[02:00.84]And in the nick of time his blessing ruled on me
[02:04.08]By his grace the phone rings
[02:04.99]A lady says "were hiring"

[02:30.16]Now I was 18 out there
[02:32.84]On the block selling drugs
[02:33.63]With a gun at my waist
[02:35.18]And for people I had no love
[02:38.01]See the streets was my home
[02:40.08]And family and friends were gone
[02:42.34]Had no one to trust
[02:44.45]And deep inside i was all alone
[02:47.22]And then a deal went bad one day
[02:49.13]And it was enough to pause me
[02:51.85]I was shot four times
[02:53.52]And before I knew it
[02:54.91]I was on my knees
[02:56.04]Blood rushing down my body
[02:57.02]My hearts beating fast
[02:58.34]I don't know what imma do
[02:59.47]I don't think i'm going to  last
[03:00.64]Then I begin to flashback
[03:02.94]On the things I done in my past
[03:05.20]Then I heard a small voice the said to me
[03:06.45]"I'll give you peace if you believe"
[03:10.15]I accepted Christ that day

[03:43.37]And the results came back and the doctor said
[03:44.84]"I'm sorry but you got cancer"
