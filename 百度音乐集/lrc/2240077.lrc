[00:00.00]Alanis Morissette - Ironic(Acoustic)
[00:10.21]
[00:12.21]An old man turned ninety-eight
[00:17.80]He won the lottery and died the next day
[00:23.86]It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
[00:29.91]It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
[00:35.34]And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
[00:40.54]
[00:40.97]It's like rain on your wedding day
[00:47.21]It's a free ride when you've already paid
[00:53.07]It's the good advice that you just didn't take
[00:59.87]Who would've thought...it figures
[01:05.48]
[01:05.93]Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
[01:11.08]He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
[01:17.14]He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
[01:23.47]And as the plane crashed down he thought
[01:26.80]\\"Well isn't this nice...\\"
[01:29.08]And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
[01:34.55]
[01:34.98]It's like rain on your wedding day
[01:40.72]It's a free ride when you've already paid
[01:46.76]It's the good advice that you just didn't take
[01:53.49]Who would've thought...it figures
[01:59.08]
[01:59.90]Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
[02:03.95]When you think everything's okay
[02:05.69]and everything's going right
[02:10.92]And life has a funny way of helping you out when
[02:15.15]You think everything's gone wrong
[02:17.64]and everything blows up
[02:19.32]In your face
[02:21.21]
[02:23.61]A traffic jam when you're already late
[02:28.77]A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
[02:35.12]It's like ten thousand spoons
[02:37.78]when all you need is a knife
[02:41.28]It's meeting the man of my dreams
[02:43.93]And then meeting his beautiful husband
[02:48.29]And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
[02:53.81]A little too ironic...and yeah I really do think...
[02:59.67]
[03:00.06]It's like rain on your wedding day
[03:05.86]It's a free ride when you've already paid
[03:11.89]It's the good advice that you just didn't take
[03:18.47]Who would've thought...it figures
[03:26.09]
