
[00:04.96]Beautiful day
[00:06.60]U2
[00:10.40]
[00:16.54]The heart is a bloom
[00:20.62]Shoots up through the stony ground
[00:23.51]There’s no room
[00:26.74]No space to rent in this town
[00:30.58]You’re out of luck
[00:33.89]And the reason that you had to care
[00:37.61]The traffic is stuck
[00:41.31]And you’re not moving anywhere
[00:44.56]You thought you’d found a friend
[00:48.43]To take you out of this place
[00:51.64]Someone you could lend a hand
[00:55.87]In return for grace
[00:58.59]It’s a beautiful day
[01:03.10]Sky falls, you feel like
[01:05.65]It’s a beautiful day
[01:09.96]Don’t let it get away
[01:12.83]You’re on the road
[01:16.32]But you’ve got no destination
[01:19.58]You’re in the mud
[01:23.25]In the maze of her imagination
[01:26.66]You love this town
[01:31.33]Even if that doesn’t ring true
[01:34.51]You’ve been all over
[01:37.20]And it’s been all over you
[01:40.55]It’s a beautiful day
[01:44.87]Don’t let it get away
[01:47.72]It’s a beautiful day
[01:55.60]Touch me
[01:59.10]Take me to that other place
[02:02.16]Teach me
[02:06.13]I know I’m not a hopeless case
[02:17.81]See the world in green and blue
[02:21.15]See China right in front of you
[02:24.65]See the canyons broken by cloud
[02:28.14]See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
[02:31.70]See the Bedouin fires at night
[02:35.13]See the oil fields at first light
[02:38.70]And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
[02:42.13]After the flood all the colors came out
[02:51.04]It was a beautiful day
[02:55.52]Don’t let it get away
[02:58.49]Beautiful day
[03:06.27]Touch me
[03:09.71]Take me to that other place
[03:12.97]Reach me
[03:16.78]I know I’m not a hopeless case
[03:20.44]What you don’t have you don’t need it now
[03:23.55]What you don’t know you can feel it somehow
[03:26.95]What you don’t have you don’t need it now
[03:30.39]Don’t need it now
[03:33.30]Was a beautiful day
[03:46.61]
