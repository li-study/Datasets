[00:00.58]
[00:00.82]You’re such a flirt, I know you hurt
[00:04.07]And so do I, I empathise
[00:07.40]I see you out, you never care
[00:10.81]A conversation that we never share
[00:13.38]
[00:14.16]But it’s so strange, it’s something new
[00:17.70]Amazing feelings that I have for you
[00:20.93]I close my eyes when I’m alone
[00:24.30]Wonder what it’d be like to make you moan
[00:26.96]
[00:27.60]I wanna give you something better
[00:30.76]Than anything you’ve ever had
[00:34.07]A stronger and a faster lover
[00:37.61]The world will disappear so fast
[00:39.94]
[00:40.82]Sweet kiwi
[00:44.13]Your juices dripping down my chin
[00:47.31]So please, let me
[00:50.91]Don’t stop it before it begins
[00:53.57]
[00:54.73]So give it up, and don’t pretend
[00:58.13]And spread your arms and legs across the bed
[01:01.49]And when you shake, you won’t regret
[01:04.95]The things I whisper in your ear
[01:07.00](What?) I said:
[01:07.47]
[01:08.23]I wanna give you something better
[01:09.89](You wanna give me something better)

[01:34.87]I can’t wait to take you home
[01:36.82]Fingers through your hair
[01:38.53]Kisses on your back
[01:40.18]And scratch me with your nails
[01:41.88]
[01:42.11]Save me from myself
[01:43.55]Show me how to care
[01:45.33]Get everything out
[01:46.87]Dripping everywhere
[01:48.65]
[01:49.17]Lipstick smeared all over your face
[01:52.05]How much longer must we wait?
[01:55.50]
