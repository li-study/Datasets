[ti:let's go to bed]
[ar:the cure]
[al:japanese whispers]

[00:38.81]let me take your hand
[00:41.16]i'm shaking like milk
[00:46.15]turning
[00:47.14]turning blue
[00:48.60]all over the windows and the floors
[00:53.64]fires outside in the sky
[00:55.99]look as perfect as cats
[01:01.11]the two of us together again
[01:04.82]but it's just the same
[01:06.62]a stupid game
[01:08.64]but i don't care if you don't
[01:12.31]and i don't feel if you don't
[01:16.13]and i don't want it if you don't
[01:20.01]and i won't say it
[01:21.85]if you don't say it first
[01:39.40]you think you're tired now
[01:41.98]but wait until three...
[01:46.29]laughing at the christmas lights
[01:50.00]you remember
[01:50.75]from december
[01:53.70]all of this then back again
[01:57.31]another girl
[01:59.07]another name
[02:01.09]stay alive but stay the same
[02:04.56]it's just the same
[02:06.94]a stupid game
[02:09.59]but i don't care if you don't
[02:12.53]and i don't feel if you don't
[02:16.18]and i don't want it if you don't
[02:19.88]and i won't play it
[02:21.86]if you don't play it first
[02:38.89]you can't even see now
[02:41.90]so you ask me the way
[02:46.24]you wonder if it's real
[02:47.81]because it couldn't be rain...
[02:53.68]through the right doorway
[02:55.47]and into the white room
[03:01.14]it used to be the dust that would lay here
[03:03.64]when i came here alone
[03:08.68]but i don't care if you don't
[03:12.44]and i don't feel if you don't
[03:16.16]and i don't want it if you don't
[03:19.92]and i won't say it
[03:21.89]if you don't say it first
