[00:00.56]Sucker
[00:07.48]
[00:08.45]You're more than tongue tied this time
[00:12.65]Well I can feel it in you lips
[00:16.52]Nobody told me you were a sucker for a kiss
[00:23.93]Music low
[00:26.34]We're all alone
[00:27.95]Being wrong never felt so right
[00:32.00]Tell me about your first kiss
[00:35.79]Tell me or have you already forgotten it
[00:39.69]Tell me about your first kiss
[00:43.33]What do I have to do to get through all of this?
[00:47.19]I'm writing it down
[00:51.12]I bet you thought this song was about you
[01:02.69]You're more than just mad this time
[01:07.65]You've got that look in your eye
[01:10.17]Nobody told me you were a sucker for a kiss
[01:17.82]Music low
[01:19.89]We're all alone
[01:22.01]Being wrong never felt so right
[01:25.85]Tell me about your first kiss
[01:33.03]Tell me or have you already forgotten it?
[01:33.40]Tell me about your first kiss
[01:37.11]What do I have to do to get through all of this?
[01:41.40]I'm writing it down
[01:44.92]Just leave me here and tell me to my face what you think about
[01:50.64]Can we figure out
[01:52.61]What happened to our happy ending anyway?
[01:56.30]How you feel about
[01:58.54]Leaving me here
[02:01.56]With a lot more left to say
[02:04.17]Music low
[02:06.11]We're all alone
[02:07.95]Being wrong never felt so right
[02:11.86]Tell me about your first kiss
[02:15.58]Tell me or have you already forgotten it
[02:19.53]Tell me about your first kiss
[02:23.12]What do I have to do to get though all of this?
[02:27.20]I'm writing it down
[02:31.05]I bet you thought this song was about you
[02:37.28]was about you
[02:40.97]was about you
[02:45.00]was about you
[02:46.45]I bet you thought this song was about you
