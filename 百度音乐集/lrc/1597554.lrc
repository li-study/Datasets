[00:05.57]
[00:07.57]Yeah
[00:08.31]
[00:08.98]Well, it's a long way from Star,Mississippi
[00:14.70]To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
[00:20.42]And sometimes the butterflies still get me
[00:26.11]When I'm in the spotlight
[00:30.99]
[00:32.27]And some people seem to think that I've changed
[00:37.50]That I'm different than I was back then
[00:43.11]But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
[00:48.85]That I've really always been
[00:54.03]
[00:54.97]'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
[00:58.05]Just 'cause everybody knows her name
[01:00.89]Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
[01:06.64]I still like wearing my old ball cap
[01:09.45]Ride my kids around piggy back
[01:12.26]They might know me all around the world
[01:17.73]But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl
[01:22.15]
[01:23.49]Whoo!
[01:24.55]
[01:31.78]Well, I spent a few weeks in California
[01:37.21]They put my face on the big movie screen
[01:42.66]But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
[01:48.62]That's just me chasing dreams
[01:53.56]
[01:54.67]'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
[01:57.84]Just 'cause everybody knows her name
[02:00.62]Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
