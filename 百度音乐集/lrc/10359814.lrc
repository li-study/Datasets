[00:01.94]Look at this photograph
[00:04.94]Every time I do it makes me laugh
[00:08.04]How did our eyes get so red
[00:11.24]And what the hell is on Joey's head?
[00:13.77]
[00:14.97]This is where I grew up
[00:17.77]I think the present owner fixed it up
[00:21.02]I never knew we ever went without
[00:24.33]The second floor is hard for sneakin' out
[00:26.80]
[00:28.04]And this is where I went to school
[00:30.83]Most of the time had better things to do
[00:34.06]Criminal record says I broke in twice
[00:37.39]I must've done it half a dozen times
[00:39.94]
[00:41.09]I wonder if it's too late
[00:43.83]Should I go back and try to graduate?
[00:47.12]Life's better now than it was back then
[00:50.49]If I was them I wouldn't let me in
[00:54.28]Oh, oh, oh...
[00:57.10]Oh, God I...
[00:59.04]Every memory of lookin' out the back door
[01:02.09]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[01:05.48]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[01:09.54]Goodbye, goodbye
[01:12.24]Every memory of walkin' out the front door
[01:15.16]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
[01:18.49]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[01:22.39]Goodbye, goodbye
[01:25.57]
[01:39.96]Remember the old arcade?
[01:42.78]Blew every dollar that we ever made
[01:46.06]The cops hated us hangin' out
[01:49.36]They said somebody went and burned it down
[01:52.18]
[01:52.70]We used to listen to the radio
[01:55.91]And sing along with every song we know
[01:59.18]We said someday we'd find out how it feels
[02:02.46]To sing to more than just the steering wheel
[02:05.23]
[02:06.14]Kim's the first girl I kissed
[02:09.02]I was so nervous that I nearly missed
[02:12.20]She's had a couple of kids since then
[02:15.51]I haven't seen her since God knows when
[02:19.21]Oh, oh, oh...
[02:21.41]Oh, God I...
[02:24.05]Every memory of lookin' out the back door
[02:27.06]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[02:30.53]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[02:34.40]Goodbye, goodbye
[02:37.25]Every memory of walkin' out the front door
[02:40.12]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
[02:43.55]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[02:47.50]Goodbye, goodbye
[02:50.59]
[02:57.70]I miss that town, I miss the faces
[03:04.82]You can't erase, you can't replace it
[03:11.27]I miss it now, I can't believe it
[03:17.73]So hard to stay, too hard to leave it
[03:24.27]
[03:24.92]If I could relive those days
[03:27.60]I know the one thing that would never change
[03:30.46]
[03:32.72]Every memory of lookin' out the back door
[03:35.77]I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
[03:39.24]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[03:43.12]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:45.93]Every memory of walkin' out the front door
[03:48.80]I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
[03:52.20]It's hard to say it, time to say it
[03:56.20]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:59.49]
[04:00.95]Look at this photograph
[04:03.74]Every time I do it makes me laugh
[04:07.03]Every time I do it makes me...
