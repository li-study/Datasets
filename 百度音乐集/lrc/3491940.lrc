[00:00.00]Relient K - Deathbed
[00:33.18]I can smell the death on the sheets
[00:38.33]Covering me
[00:40.86]I can\'t believe this is the end
[00:55.02]But this is my deathbed
[01:00.72]I lie here alone
[01:05.27]If I close my eyes tonight
[01:10.86]I know I\'ll be home
[01:18.67]The year was nineteen forty one
[01:22.55]I was eight years old and
[01:23.97]Far far too young
[01:26.80]To know that the stories
[01:28.78]Of battles and glory
[01:30.71]Was a tale a kind mother
[01:32.82]Made up for her son
[01:34.57]You see
[01:35.24]Dad was a traveling preacher
[01:39.34]Teaching the words of the Teacher
[01:43.32]My mother left mourning
[01:45.51]Went off to the war
[01:47.51]And died there with honor
[01:49.29]Somewhere on a beach there
[01:51.47]But he left once to never return
[01:55.64]Which taught me that I should unlearn
[01:59.83]Whatever I thought a father should be
[02:04.49]I abandoned that thought
[02:06.09]Like he abandoned me
[02:08.77]By forty seven I was fourteen
[02:12.02]I\'d acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine
[02:16.61]I smoked until I threw up
[02:19.12]Yet I still lit \'em up for thirty more years
[02:23.89]Like a machine
[02:26.93]So right there you have it
[02:30.88]That one filthy habit
[02:34.60]Is what got me where I am today
[02:39.39]I can smell the death on the sheets
[02:43.57]Covering me
[02:45.62]I can\'t believe this is the end
[02:55.87]I can hear those sad memories
[02:59.82]Still haunting me
[03:01.87]So many things
[03:04.66]I\'d do again
[03:14.01]But this is my deathbed
[03:18.44]I lie here alone
[03:22.11]If I close my eyes tonight
[03:26.73]I know I\'ll be home
[03:30.86]I got married on my twenty first
[03:35.10]Eight months before my wife would give birth
[03:39.27]It\'s easier to be sure you love someone
[03:43.05]When her father inquires with the barrel of a gun
[03:47.60]The union was far from harmonious
[03:51.15]No two people could have been more alone than us
[03:55.77]The years would go by and she\'d love someone else
[03:59.92]And I realized I hadn\'t been loved yet myself
[04:04.13]And there\'s your typical spiel
[04:07.56]Yeah if life was a highway
[04:10.23]I was drunk at the wheel
[04:12.18]I was seeing the loose ends
[04:14.55]All fall apart
[04:16.50]Yeah I swear I was destined to fail
[04:20.64]And fail from the start
[04:22.81]I bowled about six times a week
[04:26.89]The bottle of Beam kept the memories from me
[04:30.91]The marriage had taken a seven-ten split
[04:34.92]Along with my pride the ex-wife took the kids
[04:39.48]I can smell the death on the sheets
[04:43.44]Covering me
[04:45.53]I can\'t believe this is the end
[04:55.95]I can hear those sad memories
[05:00.07]Still haunting me
[05:01.86]So many things
[05:04.04]I\'d do again
[05:14.16]But this is my deathbed
[05:18.59]I lie here alone
[05:22.48]If I close my eyes tonight
[05:26.65]I know I\'ll be home
[05:31.00]I was so scared of Jesus
[05:33.23]But He sought me out
[05:34.94]Like the cancer in my lungs
[05:37.22]That\'s killing me now
[05:39.11]And I\'ve given up hope
[05:40.84]On the days I have left
[05:43.19]But I cling to the hope
[05:45.24]Of my life in the next
[05:47.14]Then Jesus showed up
[05:49.24]Said \"Before we go\"
[05:51.70]\"I thought that we might reminisce\"
[05:55.37]\"See one night in your life\"
[05:57.53]\"When you turned out the light\"
[05:59.91]\"You asked for and prayed for my forgiveness\"
[06:05.51]You cried wolf
[06:08.29]The tears they soaked your fur
[06:11.52]The blood dripped from your fangs
[06:15.04]You said, \"What have I done?\"
[06:19.76]You loved that lamb
[06:22.35]With every sinful bone
[06:26.15]And there you wept alone
[06:29.71]Your heart was so contrite
[06:34.61]You said, \"Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
[06:43.04]Sanctify this withered heart of mine
[06:49.68]Stay with me until my life is through
[06:56.93]And on that day please take me home with you\"
[07:05.31]I can smell the death on the sheets
[07:09.74]Covering me
[07:11.82]I can\'t believe this is the end
[07:23.26]I can hear You whisper to me,
[07:27.69]\"It\'s time to leave
[07:29.79]You\'ll never be lonely again\"
[07:42.91]But this was my deathbed
[07:48.02]I died there alone
[07:51.88]When I closed my eyes tonight
[07:56.27]You carried me home
[10:01.90]I am the Way
[10:05.62]Follow Me
[10:07.09]And take My hand
[10:11.11]And I am the Truth
[10:15.79]Embrace Me and you\'ll understand
[10:20.35]And I am the Light
[10:24.70]And for Me you\'ll live again
[10:30.24]For I am Love
[10:35.47]I am Love
[10:40.25]I, I am Love
