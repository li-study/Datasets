[ti:Moon Over Bourbon Street]
[ar:Sting]

[00:00.00]There's a moon over bourbon street tonight
[00:06.33]I see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamplight
[00:15.26]I've no choice but to follow that call
[00:20.52]The bright lights, the people, and the moon and all
[00:30.12]I pray everyday to be strong
[00:37.20]For I know what I do must be wrong
[00:45.49]Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
[00:52.89]While there's a moon over bourbon street
[01:12.80]It was many years ago that I became what I am
[01:19.88]I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb
[01:27.29]Now I can never show my face at noon
[01:33.87]And you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon
[01:43.10]The brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast
[01:50.12]I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest
[01:56.78]Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
[02:05.00]While there's a moon over bourbon street
[02:13.56]She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans
[02:54.73]She's innocent and young from a family of means
[03:02.14]I have stood many times outside her window at night
[03:08.92]To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight
[03:18.28]How could I be this way when I pray to god above
[03:25.03]I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love
[03:32.50]Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
[03:40.15]While there's a moon over bourbon street
