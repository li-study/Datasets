[00:13.52]
[00:15.52]The dusk is gaining ground, lights flicker all around
[00:22.33]And as I walk the lonely streets,
[00:26.31]the snow is falling ever faster
[00:31.01]Looking to the sky, I wonder where you are,
[00:37.41]The way you came into my life,
[00:40.92]filling every day with laughter
[00:45.85]Almost blinded by the snowflakes on my face
[00:53.55]Despite the chill I feel the warmth of your embrace
[01:00.88]Intoxicated now, I stagger like a fool
[01:08.53]I feel that surely I could float away...
[01:13.75]
[01:15.51]I want to show you everything I see,
[01:19.77]the way I'm feeling
[01:23.01]I need to be with you tonight,
[01:26.58]to hold your arms around me
[01:30.24]My love for you is deeper than
[01:33.84]the deepest snows of winter
[01:38.06]The greatest gift I ever had was you.
[01:42.83]
[01:49.30]This sparkling crystal world,
[01:52.74]this magic winter land,
[01:55.74]If I could share it all with you,
[01:60.00]and make-believe forever after
[02:04.66]Like a blanket over everything in sight,
[02:12.42]In the hush I hear the silence of the night
[02:19.67]The snow has covered all the streets we walked along
[02:27.25]I hope you still remember me tonight...
[02:32.51]
[02:34.09]I want to show you everything I see,
[02:38.58]the way I'm feeling
[02:41.47]I need to be with you tonight,
[02:45.37]to feel you all around me
[02:48.93]My love for you is deeper than
[02:52.40]the deepest snows of winter
[02:56.37]The greatest gift I ever, had
[03:01.40]Can't remember feeling this way before
[03:07.60]Do you know, do you understand
[03:11.16]what's going through my heart
[03:14.98]Well the way that I love you,
[03:18.70]I just hope you feel it too,
[03:22.51]Tonight wherever you are...
[03:29.61]
[03:33.76]I want to show you everything I see,
[03:38.63]the way I'm feeling
[03:41.39]I need to be with you tonight,
[03:44.87]to hold your arms around me
[03:49.21]My love for you is deeper than the deepest of winter
[03:56.21]The greatest gift I ever had was you,
[04:03.90]The greatest gift I ever had was you.
[04:11.21]
[04:14.43]This is my song for you...
