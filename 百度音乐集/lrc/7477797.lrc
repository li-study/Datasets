[00:19.00]Title: The Struggle Within
[00:39.08]Don't Tread On Me
[00:47.63]Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
[00:52.12]Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
[00:56.31]Never begins it, never, but once engaged
[01:00.68]Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
[01:05.93]
[01:08.87]Don't tread on me
[01:10.61]
[01:14.58]So be it
[01:17.84]Threaten no more
[01:19.39]To secure peace is to prepare for war
[01:23.66]So be it
[01:26.27]Settle the score
[01:28.46]Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
[01:31.51]
[01:38.66]Don't tread on me
[01:40.14]
[01:43.40]Love it or live it, she with the deadly bite
[01:47.50]Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lighting strike
[01:52.03]Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
[01:56.28]The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
[02:05.10]Don't tread on me
[02:10.59]So be it
[02:12.74]Threaten no more
[02:14.62]To secure peace is to prepare for war
[02:18.81]So be it
[02:21.98]Settle the score
[02:23.65]Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
[02:27.34]
[02:32.04]Don't tread on me
[02:32.78]
[03:15.93]So be it
[03:18.12]Threaten no more
[03:20.87]To secure peace is to prepare for war
[03:24.58]Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
[03:29.14]Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
[03:33.79]So be it
[03:35.96]Threaten no more
[03:38.04]To secure peace is to prepare for war
[03:42.97]So be it
[03:45.09]Settle the score
[03:47.26]Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
