[00:06.81]Title: Another One Bites The Dust
[00:08.66](Deacon)
[00:20.78]Steve walks warily down the street,
[00:24.44]with the brim pulled way down low
[00:26.79]Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
[00:29.04]machine guns ready to go
[00:31.10]Are you ready, Are you ready for this
[00:33.10]Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
[00:35.55]Out of the doorway the bullets rip
[00:37.81]To the sound of the beat
[00:42.46]Another one bites the dust
[00:46.16]Another one bites the dust
[00:48.57]And another one gone, and another one gone
[00:50.77]Another one bites the dust
[00:53.48]Hey, I'm gonna get you too
[00:58.53]Another one bites the dust
[01:06.45]How do you think I'm going to get along,
[01:08.05]without you, when you're gone
[01:10.60]You took me for everything that I had,
[01:12.60]and kicked me out on my own
[01:14.66]Are you happy, are you satisfied
[01:16.96]How long can you stand the heat
[01:19.61]Out of the doorway the bullets rip
[01:22.01]To the sound of the beat
[01:40.34]Chorus
[02:20.86]Another one bites the dust
[02:22.52]Another one bites the dust
[02:24.62]Another one bites the dust
[02:26.82]Another one bites the dust
[02:38.34]There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
[02:39.99]And bring him to the ground
[02:42.29]You can beat him
[02:43.14]You can cheat him
[02:43.64]you can treat him bad and leave him
[02:45.19]When he's down
[02:46.70]But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
[02:48.55]I'm standing on my own two feet
[02:51.20]Out of the doorway the bullets rip
[02:53.35]repeating the sound of the beat
[03:11.18]
