[00:06.63]I know you’re mad
[00:08.37]Don’t be shy
[00:10.56]Get out of your mind
[00:13.82]What’s your name
[00:15.18]And what time it is now
[00:18.52]You’re little bit upset
[00:21.10]You’re little bit sad
[00:24.01]So close your eyes
[00:27.04]Now close your eyes
[00:29.81]
[00:32.45]Just realize I’m so atypical
[00:35.77]Living in my atypical mind
[00:41.60]It’s always been this excruciating
[00:47.36]This loneliness inexplicable
[00:50.03]
[00:53.35]The river is opaque and there is something underneath I can’t say
[00:59.13]The night is bitter and the music is grey I suffocate
[01:05.06]Will you come to me, my lover
[01:07.88]Will you hold my hand and take my heart
[01:10.67]
[01:11.05]Ah……
[01:11.74]
[01:40.46]Mais laure, t’as eu tort
[01:46.89]Ce qui leur plait, ce n’est qu’un joli visage
[01:49.66]Mais toi, t’es un roc
[01:51.48]Un roc dur, que personne ne puisse casser
[01:53.71]Casse ton roc
[01:54.37]Casse-le
[01:55.45]Le briser
[01:57.07]Et l’embracer
[01:58.24]Tu es plus jolie que jamais
[01:59.61]Tu le trouveras
[02:01.82]Tu le trouveras
[02:03.65]I know I’m mad
[02:05.45]Won’t deny it.
[02:09.32]I cry because you’re no more
[02:12.25]By my side
[02:14.96]I’m a little bit upset
[02:17.79]I’m a little bit sad
[02:20.73]So close my eyes
[02:24.01]I close my eyes
[02:27.01]Just realize I’m so atypical
[02:32.73]Living in my atypical mind
[02:35.95]It’s always been this excruciating
[02:39.28]This loneliness inexplicable
[02:44.55]The river is opaque and there is something underneath I can’t say
[02:50.38]The night is bitter and the music is grey I suffocate
[03:02.08]Will you come to me, my lover
[03:05.08]Will you hold my hand and take my heart
[03:37.39]Ah……
