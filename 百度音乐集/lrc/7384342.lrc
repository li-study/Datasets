[01:22.40]
[01:29.61]Oh seven brides might meet the seven brothers
[01:33.79]That doesn't mean that you are one of them

[01:58.74]Baby you're an angel
[02:00.76]Doin things for him and not yourself
[02:04.48]
[02:14.98]Those flaming eyes that flicker in the fast lane
[02:19.24]Don't tell of broken hearts he's left behind
[02:23.41]It's hard not to succumb
[02:25.22]But you were stuck under his thumb

[02:29.51]Your mama's going out of her mind
[02:32.91]

[03:04.77]How come you never look before you leap
[03:08.94]Well baby you're an angel
[03:11.14]You didn't know he's playing this for keeps
[03:14.74]
[03:17.39]Can't you see the goog the bad the ugly
[03:21.27]They told you it was far too far to drop
[03:25.36]Oh baby you're an angel
[03:27.72]Crying on a shoulder made of rock
[03:31.96]Ahh, ahh, he wants your lovin...
