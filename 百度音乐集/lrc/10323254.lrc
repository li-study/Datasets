[00:24.03]Me and all my friends
[00:26.07]We're all misunderstood
[00:28.85]They say we stand for nothing
[00:31.39]There's no way we ever could
[00:34.16]Now we see everything is going wrong
[00:37.04]With the world and those who lead it
[00:39.64]We just feel like we don't have the means
[00:42.53]To rise above and beat it
[00:44.26]
[00:45.80]So we keep waiting (waiting)
[00:46.88]Waiting on the world to change
[00:50.26]We keep on waiting (waiting)
[00:53.08]Waiting on the world to change
[00:56.32]Its hard to be persistant
[00:58.80]When we're standing at a distance
[01:01.49]So we keep waiting (waiting)
[01:04.05]Waiting on the world to change
[01:06.99]
[01:07.46]Now if we had the power
[01:09.59]To bring our neighbors home from war
[01:12.50]They would've never missed a Christmas
[01:15.19]No more ribbons on their door
[01:18.01]When you trust your television
[01:20.62]What you get is what you got
[01:23.38]Cuz when they own the information ooohhh,
[01:26.41]They can bend it all they want
[01:28.79]So while we're waiting (waiting)
[01:31.35]Waiting on the world to change
[01:34.06]We keep on waiting (waiting)
[01:37.15]Waiting on the world to change
[01:40.00]It's not that we don't care
[01:42.48]We just know that the fight ain't fair
[01:45.08]So we keep on waiting (waiting)
[01:46.96]Waiting on the world to change
[02:34.58]We're still waiting (waiting)
[02:36.55]Waiting on the world to change
[02:39.35]We keep on waiting (waiting)
[02:41.91]Waiting on the world to change
[02:45.21]One day our generation
[02:47.83]Is gonna rule the population
[02:50.36]So we keep on waiting (waiting)
[02:52.69]Waiting on the world to change
[02:55.94]Know we keep on waiting (waiting)
[02:58.23]Waiting on the world to change
[03:01.24]We keep on waiting (waiting)
[03:04.17]Waiting on the world to change
[03:06.77]Waiting on the world to change
[03:09.28]Waiting on the world to change
[03:12.18]Waiting on the world to change
