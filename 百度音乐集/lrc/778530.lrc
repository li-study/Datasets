[00:03.43]
[00:04.47]I'm sittin' in the railway station
[00:07.54]Got a ticket for my destination, mmm
[00:15.78]On a tour of one night stands
[00:18.14]My suitcase and guitar at hand
[00:20.95]And every stop is neatly planned
[00:23.30]For a poet and a one-man band
[00:27.58]Homeward Bound
[00:30.52]I wish I was
[00:32.75]Homeward Bound
[00:36.64]Home, where my thought's escaping
[00:39.13]Home, where my music's playing
[00:41.75]Home, where my love lies waiting
[00:44.27]Silently for me
[00:48.21]Every day's an endless stream
[00:50.52]Of cigarettes and magazines, mmm
[00:58.36]And each town looks the same to me
[01:00.88]The movies and the factories
[01:03.52]And every stranger's face I see
[01:06.08]Reminds me that I long to be
[01:10.09]Homeward Bound
[01:13.00]I wish I was
[01:15.09]Homeward Bound
[01:18.93]Home, where my thought's escaping
[01:21.36]Home, where my music's playing
[01:23.97]Home, where my love lies waiting
[01:26.49]Silently for me
[01:30.11]Tonight I'll sing my songs again
[01:32.37]I'll play the game and pretend, mmm
[01:40.34]But all my words come back to me
[01:42.80]In shades of mediocrity
[01:45.35]Like emptiness in harmony
[01:48.01]I need someone to comfort me
[01:52.08]Homeward Bound
[01:54.97]I wish I was
[01:57.15]Homeward Bound
[02:00.75]Home, where my thought's escaping
[02:03.19]Home, where my music's playing
[02:05.77]Home, where my love lies waiting
[02:08.25]Silently for me
[02:11.47]
[02:13.29]Silently for me
