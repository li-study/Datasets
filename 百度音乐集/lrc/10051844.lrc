[00:00.33]Daffodil Lament (The Cranberries)
[00:35.45]
[00:45.60]Holding on that's what I do
[00:52.28]since I met you
[00:54.82]And it won't be long, would you notice
[01:01.73]If I left you
[01:04.17]And it's fine for some
[01:08.08]Cause you're not the one,
[01:10.96]you're not the one
[01:33.03]
[01:52.30]All night long, I laid on my pillow
[02:01.20]These things are wrong
[02:05.19]I can't sleep here
[02:08.52]
[02:27.13]So lonely, so lonely
[02:35.11]
[03:29.99]I have decided to leave you forever
[03:34.18]I have decided to start things from here
[03:38.27]Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feeling
[03:42.97]
[03:43.19]And the daffodils look lovely today
[03:47.18]And the daffodils look lovely today
[03:53.53]Look lovely today
[03:57.45]
[03:58.94]OL in your eyes I can see the disguise
[04:03.12]OL in your eyes I can see the dismay
[04:07.84]Has anyone seen lightning
[04:12.00]Has anyone looked lovely
[04:15.64]
[04:15.90]And the daffodils looked lovely today
[04:20.10]And the daffodils looked lovely today
[04:26.31]Looked lovely
[04:30.49]Looked lovely
[04:32.44]Looked lovely
[04:34.48]Looked lovely
[04:36.53]Looked lovely
[04:38.61]Looked lovely
[04:40.66]Looked lovely...
[04:48.25]na na... na na na na...
[05:06.16]
[06:04.87][The End]
