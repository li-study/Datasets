[00:29.47]Let me tell you.....
[00:30.67]
[00:31.63]Jenny's getting her stuff in my room
[00:34.48]Puts on her skirt and she's looking good
[00:38.07]Six AM and she's leaving soon
[00:40.61]Says what a crazy night
[00:42.84]I had a real good time
[00:44.67]But her kiss tells me it's goodbye
[00:48.49]Just like nothing happened last night
[00:52.16]But if I had one chance
[00:54.61]I'd do it all over again
[01:44.65][01:00.08]One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more
[01:50.26][01:05.56]She was only looking for a one night stand
[01:54.11][01:08.81]I don't think she's coming back for more
[01:13.20]No no
[01:15.57]Now I'm left up in my lonely room
[01:19.15]She left her underwear and her perfume
[01:22.82]I never thought that it could be this good
[01:25.75]And I still feel a little on my fingertips
[01:29.54]I'm trying hard not to feel rejected
[01:32.83]Maybe the phone line's disconnected
[01:36.55]But if I had one chance
[01:38.89]I'd do it all over again
[01:41.04]I know it
[01:57.92]She was only looking
[01:59.71]One night stand but I'd do it all again for sure
[02:04.76]Oh yeah
[02:07.90]Baby like a blind man I rushed in
[02:15.24]Now do I have the right to ask you,
[02:18.33]Will you be coming back again?
[02:36.93][02:29.45][02:22.67]One night stand I don't think she's coming back
[02:44.48]One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more
[02:49.79]She was only looking
[02:51.86]One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more
[02:57.23]She was only looking for a one night stand
[03:00.35]I don't think she's coming back for more
[03:04.65]She was only looking for a one night stand
[03:07.77]I don't think she's coming back for more
[03:12.07]She was only looking
[03:13.97]One night stand but I'd do it all again for sure
[03:42.01][03:34.45][03:26.98][03:19.84]I guess it was a one night stand
[03:46.93][03:39.04][03:31.68][03:24.20]One night stand
[03:49.60]I know it, yeah
