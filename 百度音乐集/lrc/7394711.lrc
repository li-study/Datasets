[00:04.94]I woke dreaming we had broke
[00:11.52]Dreaming you left me for someone new
[00:16.05]And you cried, drying those brown eyes
[00:22.95]Crying you're sorry - sorry won't do
[00:27.54]But this is the way I need to wake
[00:31.85]I wake to you
[00:36.09]And you never left me
[00:38.09]All that I dreamt had been untrue
[00:42.95]Open my eyes
[00:44.96]I see sky
[00:46.61]
[00:47.10]Oh, oh, oh, oh,
[00:50.89]you know the way to keep me on my toes
[00:54.56]I, I, I will be fine -
[00:58.52]just say you'll stay forever mine
[01:03.31]'Til we fall asleep tonight
[01:05.92]
[01:09.68]Last night, we had a great fight
[01:16.14]I fell asleep in a horrible state
[01:20.69]Then dreamt that you loved my best friend
[01:27.50]My heart would not mend - seemed it was fate
[01:32.21]But this is the way I need to wake
[01:36.53]I wake to you
[01:40.66]And you never left me
[01:42.82]All that I dreamt had been untrue
[01:47.43]Open my eyes
[01:49.76]I see sky
[01:51.43]
[01:51.77]Oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:55.98]you know the way to keep me on my toes
[01:59.29]I, I, I will be fine -
[02:03.12]just say you'll stay forever mine
[02:08.03]'Til we fall asleep tonight
[02:10.86]
[02:15.19]Sometimes I forget to love you like I should
[02:22.86]But I'd never leave you - no, I never would
[02:27.76]I never would
[02:30.05]
[02:31.76]Oh, oh, oh, oh,
[02:35.65]you know the way to keep me on my toes
[02:39.34]I, I, I will be fine -
[02:43.31]just say you'll stay forever mine
[02:47.16]Oh, oh, oh, oh,
[02:51.09]you know the way to keep me on my toes
[02:54.55]I, I, I will be fine -
[02:58.54]just say you'll stay forever mine
[03:03.30]'Til we fall asleep tonight
