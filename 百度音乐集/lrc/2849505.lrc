[00:00.59]Nat King Cole - The Very Thought Of You
[00:05.23]The very thought of you and I forget to do
[00:17.59]The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
[00:30.03]Im living in a kind of daydream
[00:38.46]Im happy as a king
[00:44.27]And foolish though it may seem
[00:50.12]To me thats everything
[00:55.91]The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
[01:07.56]You’ll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
[01:20.24] I see your face in every flower
[01:28.00]Your eyes in stars above
[01:33.44]It’s just the thought of you
[01:37.22]The very thought of you, my love

[02:47.52]You’ll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
[03:00.22]I see your face in every flower
[03:07.91]Your eyes in stars above
[03:13.34]Its just the thought of you
[03:18.46]The very thought of you, my love
