[00:16.66]I miss the sound of your voice
[00:21.62]And I miss the rush of your skin
[00:26.81]And I miss the still of the silence
[00:31.22]As you breathe out and I breathe in
[00:36.49]If I could walk on water
[00:39.57]If I could tell you what's next
[00:42.33]I'd make you believe
[00:44.70]I'd make you forget
[00:46.74]
[00:47.33]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[00:49.94]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[00:52.48]Just pull me down hard
[00:54.60]And drown me in love
[00:57.77]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[01:00.31]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[01:02.91]Just pull me down hard
[01:05.07]And drown me in love
[01:07.67]
[01:08.74]I miss the sound of your voice
[01:13.66]The loudest thing in my head
[01:19.05]And I ache to remember
[01:23.02]All the violent, sweet, perfect words that you said
[01:28.72]If I could walk on water
[01:31.55]If I could tell you what's next
[01:34.33]I'd make you believe
[01:36.84]I'd make you forget
[01:39.21]
[01:39.56]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[01:41.94]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[01:44.59]Just pull me down hard
[01:46.83]And drown me in love
[01:49.98]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[01:52.36]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[01:54.97]Just pull me down hard
[01:57.22]And drown me in love
[01:59.83]
[02:00.95]I miss the pull of your heart
[02:03.44]I taste the sparks on your tongue
[02:06.03]I see angels and devils and God, when you come on
[02:12.97]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
[02:22.93]Singin' sha la la la
[02:28.19]Singin' sha la la la la
[02:31.51]
[02:42.36]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[02:44.54]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[02:47.29]Just pull me down hard
[02:49.48]And drown me in love
[02:52.60]So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
[02:54.94]Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
[02:57.83]Just pull me down hard
[02:59.91]And drown me, drown me in love
[03:03.66]
[03:05.03]So wrong, So wrong
[03:09.86]So wrong, So right
[03:13.14]So come on, get higher
[03:16.18]So come on and get higher
[03:18.46]'Cause everything works, love
[03:21.22]Everything works in your arms
[03:26.43]
