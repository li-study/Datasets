[00:02.50]曲 : 彭靖惠/谢宇书词 : 彭靖惠
[00:10.03]The rain is pouring from my eyes
[00:18.61]And it's so windy in my brain
[00:27.50]'Cause it's been 5 minutes
[00:30.66]I haven't seen your face,baby
[01:39.03][00:35.30]I can't think of anything now
[01:44.60][00:42.17]Anything but you
[01:47.78][00:45.45]Love has put me through this messy
[01:53.29][00:51.00]stormy weather In this hurricane
[02:02.25][00:59.85]Everything's twisted In this hurricane
[02:10.99][01:08.60]I feel like screaming In this hurricane
[02:20.51]Everything's twisted In this hurricane
[01:21.11]So this is called falling in love
[01:25.51]I never thought I'd feel this way
[01:29.85]My world is up side down
[01:33.33]When you are not around,baby
