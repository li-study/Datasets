[03:40.90][00:00.68]I made you think, you don't understand.
[03:08.79][03:04.24][02:52.73][02:39.84][02:28.79][02:26.53][02:19.38][01:52.74][01:46.68][01:16.96][01:08.97][00:42.94][00:05.83]
[00:07.97]I used to think that happiness could only be something
[00:13.63]That happened to somebody else
[00:15.02]Everybody believed, everybody but me, yeah yeah
[00:20.01]And I've been hurt so many times before,
[00:23.30]That my hopes was dying, so sick of trying
[00:27.07]Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah yeah
[00:31.59]But then you came into my life, you opened up my softer side
[00:38.71]And now I can see into your eyes
[00:41.61]And suddenly, I realize.
[03:26.29][03:17.22][03:09.07][02:10.66][02:01.70][01:53.15][01:00.69][00:52.11][00:43.39]I made you think, you don't understand
[01:57.33][00:47.98]All the times you didn't understand,
[00:49.76]Why you couldn't just be my man.
[03:21.85][00:56.58]There were many walls you had to climb,
[00:58.26]If you really wanted to be mine.
[01:05.72]After all the hoops I put you through,
[02:17.74][01:07.48]Now I see that I'm in love with you
[03:36.06][01:09.98]Now, I hope you finally understand.
[01:17.89]So many tears I've had to cry,
[01:20.42]But you had many more of your own you had to try
[01:24.85]But you stuck it out and you're here with me now, yeah yeah
[01:30.09]And rememberin' the days I pushed away your love,
[01:33.41]You called my bluff and you still stayed around,
[01:37.05]Yeah you figured me out
[01:38.73]Said, you got me down
[01:42.96]And there's no way to lie to you, you know me better than I do
[01:48.46]Baby, ooh, you see me through,
[01:50.32]I'd be no good without you.
[03:14.87][01:58.96]Why you just couldn't be my man
[02:06.51]There were many walls you had to climb (yeah)
[02:08.33]If you really wanted to be mine (ooh)
[02:15.38]After all the hoops I put you through (through)
[02:20.12]Now, I hope you finally understand
[02:27.07]Ohh.
[02:29.18]Baby, won't you listen now
[02:37.32][02:31.43]Can't you see just what I'm talking about?
[02:34.31]Said baby won't you listen now
[02:40.61]Time went on, and I was wrong
[02:43.11]To keep my distance for so long.
[02:48.31]So afraid, you wouldn't stay
[02:49.61]But you never turned away
[02:53.40]Always right by my side
[02:55.66]You're forever in my life
[02:58.51]Don't you go
[03:00.25]'Cause now I know
[03:02.65]That in you I found a home.
[03:04.48]Now I can see into your eyes
[03:06.30]Suddenly, I realize.
[03:13.38]All the times you didn't understand
[03:23.96]If you really wanted to be mine
[03:31.69]After all the hoops I put you through
[03:33.11]Now I see I'm in love with you.
