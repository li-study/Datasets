[00:10.61]The skies don't seem to be as dark as usual
[00:17.63]The stars seem brighter then they've been before
[00:22.90]Deep within I feel my soul a stirring
[00:28.81]As though my hope has been restored
[00:34.25]
[00:35.11]The shepherds say they've heard the voice of angels
[00:40.55]Confirming rumors spread across the land
[00:46.02]That a child protected well from Herod's anger

[01:14.80]He's the Savior we have been praying for
[01:19.36]In our humble hearts He will dwell
[01:23.60]God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel
[01:32.85]
[01:38.99]I feel compelled to tell all who will listen
[01:44.61]That peace on earth is not so out of reach
[01:50.57]If we can find grace, mercy and forgiveness
[01:55.71]He has come to save, He is all of these
