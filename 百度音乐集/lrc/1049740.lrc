[00:05.59]jack johnson
[00:08.59]
[00:33.57]Brushfire fairytales
[00:36.52]Itsy bitsy diamond wells
[00:39.98]Big fat hurricanes
[00:43.11]Yellow bellied given names
[00:46.90]Well shortcuts can slow you down
[00:50.38]And in the end we're bound
[00:53.34]To rebound off of we
[00:55.55]
[01:00.36]Well dust off your thinking caps
[01:03.32]Solar powered plastic plants
[01:06.79]Pretty pictures of things we ate
[01:10.07]We are only what we hate
[01:13.73]But in the long run we have found
[01:16.66]Silent films are full of sound
[01:20.10]Inaudibly free
[01:22.24]
[01:28.06]Slow down everyone
[01:31.08]You're moving too fast
[01:34.82]Frames can't catch you when
[01:37.77]You're moving like that
[01:40.61]
[01:41.54]Inaudible melodies
[01:44.69]Serve narrational strategies
[01:48.34]Unobtrusive tones
[01:51.10]Help to notice nothing but the zone
[01:54.66]Of visual relevancy
[01:58.19]Frame-lines tell me what to see
[02:01.56]Chopping like an axe
[02:04.06]Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax
[02:08.28]Slow down everyone
[02:11.24]You're moving too fast
[02:15.10]Frames can't catch you when
[02:18.06]You're moving like that
[02:20.75]
[02:35.17]Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
[02:38.57]Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
[02:41.87]I wish they could believe
[02:44.27]In all the things that never made the screen
[02:48.38]And just slow down everyone
[02:51.53]You're moving too fast
[02:55.32]Frames can't catch you when
[02:58.26]You're moving like that
[03:02.00]Slow down everyone
[03:04.87]You're moving too fast
[03:08.76]Frames can't catch you when
[03:11.77]You're moving like that
[03:14.62]Moving Too.
