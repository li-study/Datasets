[00:26.74]I could build a mansion
[00:30.76]that is higher than the trees
[00:38.62]I could have all the gifts I want
[00:44.68]and never ask please
[00:51.59]I could fly to Paris,
[00:55.99]it's at my beck and call
[01:03.78]Why do I live my life alone
[01:09.53]with nothing at all?
[01:15.79]But when I dream, I dream of you
[01:29.41]Maybe someday you will come true
[01:41.94]When I dream, I dream of you
[01:54.50]Maybe someday you will come true

[02:28.24]I can be the singer
[02:32.50]or the clown in every room
[02:40.47]I can call up someone
[02:45.31]to take me to the moon
[02:53.05]I can put my makeup on
[02:57.95]and drive the men insane
[03:05.85]I can go to bed alone
[03:10.44]and never know his name
[03:17.46]But when I dream, I dream of you
[03:29.83]Maybe someday you will come true
[03:43.43]When I dream, I dream of you
[03:55.95]Maybe someday you will come true
