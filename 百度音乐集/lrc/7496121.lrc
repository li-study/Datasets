[00:08.00]献给那些从我身边溜走的人
[00:16.00]He called her on the road
[00:19.00]From a lonely cold hotel room
[00:22.00]Just to hear her say I love you one more time
[00:30.00]But when he heard the sound
[00:33.00]Of the kids laughing in the background
[00:37.00]He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
[00:44.00]A little voice came on the phone
[00:47.00]Said "Daddy when you coming home"
[00:51.00]He said the first thing that came to his mind
[00:57.00]I'm already there
[01:01.00]Take a look around
[01:03.00]I'm the sunshine in your hair
[01:08.00]I'm the shadow on the ground
[01:11.00]I'm the whisper in the wind
[01:14.00]I'm your imaginary friend
[01:19.00]And I know I'm in your prayers
[01:25.00]Oh I'm already there
[01:34.00]She got back on the phone
[01:38.00]Said I really miss you darling
[01:41.00]Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
[01:48.50]Wish I was in your arms
[01:52.50]Lying right there beside you
[01:56.00]But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
[02:03.00]And I'll gently kiss your lips
[02:07.00]Touch you with my fingertips
[02:10.00]So turn out the light and close your eyes
[02:16.50]I'm already there
[02:20.50]Don't make a sound
[02:23.50]I'm the beat in your heart
[02:27.00]I'm the moonlight shining down
[02:30.50]I'm the whisper in the wind
[02:34.30]And I'll be there until the end
[02:39.00]Can you feel the love that we share
[02:44.50]Oh I'm already there
[02:51.30]We may be a thousand miles apart
[02:58.30]But I'll be with you wherever you are
[03:06.50]I'm already there
[03:10.00]Take a look around
[03:14.00]I'm the sunshine in your hair
[03:17.00]I'm the shadow on the ground
[03:20.50]I'm the whisper in the wind
[03:24.30]And I'll be there until the end
[03:29.00]Can you feel the love that we share
[03:35.00]Oh I'm already there
[03:42.00]Oh I'm already
[03:45.00]There
[04:03.00]The end
[04:10.00]
