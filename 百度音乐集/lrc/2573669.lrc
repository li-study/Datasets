[00:00.85]Mississippi
[00:06.39]- Pussycat
[00:13.58]
[00:17.48]Where you can hear a country song from far
[00:25.22]And someone plays the honky-tonk guitar
[00:32.96]Where all the lights will go out one by one
[00:38.72]The people join the sun
[00:42.30]And the wind takes it away
[00:45.60]
[00:48.28]Where the Mississippi falls down to the sea
[00:56.32]And lovers found the place thhhey'd like to be
[01:04.03]How many times before the song was ending
[01:09.96]Love and understanding
[01:14.11]Everywhere around
[01:17.32]
[01:19.89]Mississippi
[01:28.64]I'll remember you
[01:35.16]Whenever I should go away
[01:39.28]I'll be longing for the day
[01:42.93]That I will be returning again
[01:50.86]Mississippi
[01:59.60]you'll be on my mind
[02:07.44]Everytime I hear this song
[02:11.66]Mississippi roll along
[02:15.85]Until the end of time
[02:19.55]
[02:27.44]Now the country song for ever lost its soul
[02:35.27]when the guitar player turned to rock & roll
[02:43.31]and everytime when the summernights are falling
[02:49.06]I will always be calling dreams of yesterday
