[00:34.50]Some might say...
[00:36.50]that sunshine follows thunder
[00:42.50]Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
[00:52.50]Some might say...
[00:54.50]that we should never ponder
[01:00.50]On our thoughts today...
[01:02.50]cos they will sway over time
[01:09.50]Some might say we will find a brighter day
[01:17.50]Some might say we will find a brighter day
[01:27.50]Cos I've been standing at the station
[01:29.50]In need of education in the rain
[01:36.50]You made no preparation...
[01:38.50]for my reputation once again
[01:45.50]The sink is full of fishes
[01:47.50]She's got dirty dishes on the brain
[01:53.50]It was overflowing gently...
[01:55.50]but it's all elementary my friend
[02:28.50]Some might say...
[02:30.50]they don't believe in heaven
[02:36.50]Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
[02:46.50]Some might say...
[02:48.50]you get what you've been given
[02:54.50]If you don't get yours...
[02:56.50]I won't get mine as well
[03:03.50]Some might say we will find a brighter day
[03:11.50]Some might say we will find a brighter day
[03:20.50]Cos I've been standing at the station
[03:23.50]In need of education in the rain
[03:29.50]You made no preparation...
[03:31.50]for my reputation once again
[03:38.50]The sink is full of fishes...
[03:41.50]she's got dirty dishes on the brain
[03:47.50]And my dog's been itching...
[03:49.50]itching in the kitchen once again
