[00:13.56]I realize you're seeing someone new
[00:19.79]I don't believe she knows you like I do
[00:25.78]Your temperamental moody side, the one you always try to hide from me
[00:37.96]But I know when you have some thing on your mind
[00:43.86]You've been trying to tell me for the longest time
[00:50.15]And before you break my heart in two,
[00:52.90]There's something I've been trying to say to you
[01:02.06]But the words get in the way
[01:08.65]There's so much I want to say
[01:14.62]But it's locked deep inside and if you look in my eyes,
[01:20.83]We might fall in love again.
[01:26.50]I won't even start to cry, and before we say goodbye
[01:38.78]I tried to say I love you
[01:42.53]But the words got in the way
[01:51.77]Your heart has always been an open door
[01:57.26]But baby I don't even know you any more
[02:04.12]And despite the fact it's hurting me,
[02:06.32]I know the time has come to set you free
[02:15.48]But the words get in the way
[02:22.04]There's so much I want to say
[02:27.55]But it's locked deep inside and if you look in my eyes,
[02:34.30]We might fall in love again
[02:40.42]I won't even start to cry, and before we say goodbye
[02:50.69]I tried to say I love you, but the words got in the way
[03:04.61]I'm trying to say I love you
[03:07.41]But the words get in the way
