[00:13.82]The Smashing Pumpkins
[00:16.47]Twilight To Starlight
[00:53.42]Wrap me up in always,
[00:59.85]and drag me in with maybes
[01:06.98]Your innocence is treasure,
[01:10.49]your innocence is death
[01:14.23]Your innocence is all I have
[01:21.58]Breathing under water,
[01:28.64]and living under glass, and
[01:32.17]If you spin your love around
[01:35.75]The secrets of your dreams
[01:38.53]You may find your love is gone
[01:42.79]And is not quite what it seemed
[01:45.57]To appear to disappear
[01:50.06]Beneath all your darkest fears
[02:14.43]I believe in never,
[02:20.97]I believe in all the way
[02:27.44]But belief is not to notice,
[02:31.39]belief is just some faith
[02:34.79]And faith can't help you to escape
[02:43.45]And with this ring I wed thee true
[02:49.14]And with this ring I wed thee now
[02:55.91]And with this ring I play so dead
[03:01.33]But no ones asking for the truth, so let me tell you
[03:09.82]If you spin your love around
[03:13.81]The secrets of your dreams
[03:16.28]You may find your love is gone
[03:20.22]And is not quite what it seemed
[03:22.73]To appear to disappear
[03:26.76]Beneath all your darkest fears
[03:42.67]To the reveleations of fresh faced youth
[03:49.44]No one will come to save you
[03:56.10]So speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
[04:03.05]But youth is wasted on the young
[04:11.75]Your strength is my weakness,
[04:15.19]your weakness my hate
[04:19.04]My love for you just can't explain
[04:22.90]Why were forever frozen, forever beautiful
[04:32.89]Forever lost inside ourselves
[04:51.50]The night has come to hold us young
