[00:00.00]Stayin' Alive
[02:14.00][00:13.00]Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,
[02:16.00][00:16.00]I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.
[00:18.00]Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
[00:22.00]since I was born.
[02:23.00][00:23.00]And now it's all right.  It's OK.
[02:25.00][00:25.00]And you may look the other way.
[02:28.00][01:16.00][00:27.00]We can try to understand
[02:30.00][00:30.00]the New York Times' effect on man.
[02:33.00][01:21.00][00:32.00]Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,
[02:35.00][01:23.00][00:34.00]you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
[02:37.00][01:26.00][00:37.00]Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',
[02:39.00][01:27.00][00:39.00]and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
[02:42.00][01:30.00][00:41.00]Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
[02:46.00][01:35.00][00:46.00]Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.
[01:02.00]Well now, I get low and I get high,
[01:04.00]and if I can't get either, I really try.
[01:07.00]Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.
[01:09.00]I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.
[01:11.00]You know it's all right.  It's OK.
[01:14.00]I'll live to see another day.
[01:18.00]the New York Times' effect on man.
[04:21.00][03:54.00][03:29.00][03:03.00][02:03.00][01:52.00]Life goin' nowhere.  Somebody help me.
[04:25.00][03:59.00][03:34.00][03:08.00][01:57.00]Somebody help me, yeah.
[02:18.00]Music loud and women warm,
[02:21.00]I've been kicked around since I was born.
[04:31.00][04:06.00][03:40.00][03:14.00]Life goin' nowhere.  Somebody help me, yeah.
[04:12.00][03:46.00][03:21.00]I'm stayin' alive.
