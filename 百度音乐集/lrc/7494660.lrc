[00:09.31]
[00:12.79]The bar was empty
[00:15.97]I was sweeping up the floor
[00:20.64]That's when she walked in
[00:23.04]I said, "I'm sorry but we're closed"
[00:25.92]And she said "I know,
[00:29.60]But I'm afraid I left my purse"
[00:32.93]I said, "I put one back behind the bar
[00:37.08]I bet it's probably yours"
[00:39.60]And the next thing that I knew
[00:42.44]There we were, lost in conversation
[00:48.86]
[00:52.64]And before I handed her her purse
[00:55.91]I said, "You'll only get this back on one condition"
[01:01.54]
[01:05.31]And we danced
[01:09.40]Out there on that empty hardwood floor
[01:16.03]The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
[01:22.71]The music played, we held each other close
[01:31.67]And we danced
[01:33.09]
[01:38.32]And from that moment
[01:41.69]There was never any doubt
[01:45.69]I had found the one
[01:48.58]That I had always dreamed about
[01:51.67]And then one evenin'
[01:55.15]When she stopped by after work
[01:58.76]I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
[02:04.93]And as her eyes filled up with tears
[02:08.27]She said, "This is the last thing I expected"
[02:18.24]And then she took me by the hand
[02:21.47]And said, "I'll only marry you on one condition"Chorus
[02:30.96]And we danced
[02:34.95]Out there on that empty hardwood floor
[02:41.49]The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
[02:48.19]The music played, we held each other close
[02:54.03]And we danced
[02:55.35]
[02:57.60]Like no one else had ever danced before
[03:04.15]I can't explain what happened on that floor
[03:10.91]But the music played
[03:13.22]We held each other close
[03:18.28]
[03:20.04]And we danced
[03:22.63]
[03:26.42]Yeah, we danced
[03:28.73]
