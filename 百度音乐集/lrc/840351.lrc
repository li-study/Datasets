[00:10.48]As I’m lying here
[00:13.23]And the night is near
[00:15.90]Well I start to wonder why
[00:21.18]We’ve all grown apart?
[00:23.83]Have we lost our hearts?
[00:26.51]Oh it makes me wanna cry
[00:32.85]Gotta make it together
[00:35.42]Gotta make it all right
[00:37.81]There is not enough love to go ‘round
[00:43.26]No one said it was easy
[00:45.97]No one said it’s a game
[00:48.39]But no one said that it was gonna be this hard
[00:51.49]
[00:53.08]Because our world is falling apart
[00:57.61]We still got lots of love in our hearts
[01:02.98]So what can we do?
[01:05.65]Can we start anew?
[01:08.32]And just make the world
[01:11.03]A little bit better  just little bit better

[01:35.62]So I smile and greet
[01:38.51]Everyone I meet
[01:41.03]Every person in the streets
[01:46.12]
[01:47.37]If everybody could feel good
[01:49.76]If everyone was ok
[01:52.31]There would be enough love to go around
[01:57.99]No one said it was easy
[02:00.48]No one said it’s a game
[02:03.03]But no one said that it was gonna be this hard
[02:07.19]
[02:07.76]Because our world is falling apart
[02:12.07]We still got lots of love in our hearts
[02:17.35]So what can we do?
