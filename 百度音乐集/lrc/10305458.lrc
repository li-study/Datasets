[00:16.00]I was the one, who would always jump in first
[00:23.27]Didn't think twice to look behind
[00:30.05]Got such a good feeling, just from playing in the dirt
[00:36.15]Once, when I was little
[00:40.63]
[00:43.72]We could build a rocket, fly to the moon

[01:23.58]That the world could only get better
[01:30.18]I was free more then
[01:33.59]I could pretend more then
[01:37.21]That this life could only show me good times
[01:43.00]Once, when I was little umm

[02:55.70]That this life could only show me good times
[03:01.43]Once, when I was little
[03:04.61]I used to feel so strong
[03:08.41]Even when they tell me, tell me I was wrong
[03:15.16]That I can't live in a magic world
[03:18.24]Cause it's time for me to grow up
[03:21.62]That I got to be like the rest of them

[04:16.20]Stay as young you can, for the longest time
[04:23.13]Cause those days flew by
[04:25.73]Like a breeze just passing through
[04:29.56]Once, when I was little
