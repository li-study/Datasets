[00:07.90]
[00:11.90]You're losing a friend
[00:19.52]You got it all wrong
[00:26.71]It’s not about revenge
[00:33.68]But you're losing a friend
[00:37.09]
[00:41.34]I didn't see it coming
[00:47.66]With my head stuck in the sand
[00:54.62]But now I’m losing a friend
[00:59.13]And it's keeping me up
[01:02.15]It's the ribbons I tied
[01:05.63]I would rather just die
[01:09.08]Go to hell and crawl back
[01:13.08]Than let you go
[01:19.63]
[01:26.72]You're losing a friend
[01:33.94]You jeopardise me
[01:40.15]Bad bad blood on your hands
[01:47.20]And see, you're losing a friend
[01:51.39]
[01:55.11]I'm fickle and I’m vain
[02:01.54]And you trick me over and over again
[02:07.92]And now I’m losing you
[02:11.51]
[02:11.96]And it's killing me
[02:14.80]It's the strings that I tie
[02:18.18]I would rather just die
[02:21.48]Go to hell and crawl back
[02:25.49]Then let it all go
[02:32.55]
[02:36.73]My mistake
[02:39.30]To lose you
[02:41.24]
[02:59.27]Oh no, oh no!
[03:02.92]So this the end now
[03:06.54]I'm losing you
[03:09.57]Oh, look at you!
[03:13.54]Look what you're wasting
[03:16.86]You're losing a friend
[03:19.76]Oh no, oh no!
[03:23.36]I'm losing a friend
[03:26.72]Oh, oh oh no
