[00:10.70]
[00:16.70]You and I,we're two of a kind
[00:20.92]I hate to say it but you'll never relate
[00:24.37]What makes you tick
[00:27.65]It makes me smile
[00:32.22]
[00:33.60]You said that I should get away from it all
[00:37.58]And bury my head in the sand if I want to
[00:41.45]I think you
[00:43.82]Should thank me now
[00:48.86]
[00:48.90]You were lying wide awake in the garden
[00:53.24]Trying to get over your stardom
[00:57.63]And I could never see you depart us
[01:01.27]And you're my baby
[01:05.28]You're just another girl
[01:09.19]
[01:14.08]Just another girl
[01:17.61]
[01:23.51]I never mind the way I had to see ya
[01:27.81]My working on a day show never explains why I see you
[01:33.66]And I feel your pain
[01:38.53]
[01:40.11]I love to wear my work inside of my head
[01:44.39]I can't complain but you should never react the way you did
[01:50.31]I feel your time
[01:55.52]
[01:56.02]You were lying wide awake in the garden
[02:00.08]Trying to get over your stardom
[02:04.39]And I could never see you depart us
[02:08.14]And you're my baby
[02:12.08]And you were lying wide awake in the garden
[02:16.79]Trying to get over your stardom
[02:21.06]And I could never see you depart us
[02:24.87]And you're my baby
[02:28.54]You're just another girl
[02:32.48]You're just another girl
[02:37.05]You're just another girl
