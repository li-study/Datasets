[00:22.77]I said I wanna touch the earth.
[00:26.39]I wanna break it in my hands.
[00:29.51]I wanna grow something wild
[00:32.01]and unruly.
[00:35.05]I wanna sleep on the hard ground.
[00:37.94]In the comfort of your arms.
[00:41.13]On a pillow of bluebonnets.
[00:44.06]In a blanket made of stars.
[00:46.93]Oh ! It sounds good to me.
[00:51.04]I said...
[00:52.87]Cowboy take me away.
[00:57.52]Fly this girl as high as you can
[00:59.89]into the wild blue.
[01:03.47]Set me free.
[01:05.74]Oh,  I pray.
[01:09.20]Closer to heaven
[01:11.01]above and closer to you.
[01:15.36]Closer to you.
[01:16.76][Music]...........[Music]
[01:27.41]I wanna walk and not run.
[01:30.56]I wanna skip and not fall.
[01:33.30]I wanna look at the horizon
[01:36.11]and not see a building
[01:37.79]standing tall.
[01:39.58]I wanna be the only one
[01:42.46]for miles and miles.
[01:45.27]Except for maybe you
[01:47.56]and your simple smile.
[01:51.30]Oh ! It sounds good to me.
[01:56.42]Yes, it sounds so good to me.
[02:02.21]Cowboy take me away.
[02:07.56]Fly this girl as high as you can
[02:10.14]into the wild blue.
[02:13.47]Set me free.
[02:15.48]Oh !  I pray.
[02:19.07]Closer to heaven
[02:20.85]above and closer to you.
[02:25.20]Closer to you.
