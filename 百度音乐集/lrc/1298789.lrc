[00:13.86]Hey, it might never be the same
[00:24.69]We might never live those days gone by
[00:32.94]But we can try
[00:36.76]Good morning
[00:41.04]Let's kick the babies out of bed
[00:47.01]How about you and me instead hanging on
[00:55.45]Not up and gone
[01:00.90]Baby, hold on
[01:03.45]Let's start this over
[01:07.33]Baby, hold on
[01:09.78]We're not much older now
[01:13.69]Baby, hold on
[01:16.13]If you still see what I see
[01:21.27]Keep holding on
[01:24.84]Hold on to me
[01:40.96]Baby, it's good to see you smile again
[01:51.92]I know we can't escape
[01:54.94]So let's pretend
[02:00.14]We're someplace else
[02:03.51]It's a new day
[02:08.22]Let's look at all we've got
[02:14.36]It's everything we thought
[02:17.83]We ever wanted
[02:24.47]It's beautiful
[02:27.86]Baby, hold on
[02:30.56]Let's start this over
[02:34.13](Baby, hold on)
[02:37.54]We're not much older now
[02:40.40]Baby, hold on
[02:43.35]If you still see what I see
[02:48.54]Keep holding on
[02:51.83]Hold on to me
[03:19.67]I look across the room and catch you staring at me
[03:26.88]And see the love we almost left behind
[03:33.07]So lead me by the hand and let's make up
[03:37.84]Let's make up for lost time
[03:44.91]Baby, hold on
[03:47.08]Let's start this over
[03:50.82]Baby, hold on
[03:53.43]We're not much older
[03:57.21]Baby, hold on
[03:59.76]If you still see what I see
[04:05.02]Keep holding on
[04:10.29]Baby, hold on
[04:13.53]Hold on to me
[04:16.18]Baby, hold on
[04:18.90]Just hold on to me
[04:22.61]Baby, hold on
[04:25.56]Hold on to me
[04:30.37]Keep holding on
[04:37.28]Hey, it might never be the same
[04:48.23]We might never live those days gone by
