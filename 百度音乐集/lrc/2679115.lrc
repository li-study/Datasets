[00:40.54]
[00:42.54]T'aint no big t'ing
[00:45.07]To wait for the bell to ring
[00:50.07]T'aint no big t'ing
[00:53.31]The toll of the bell
[00:57.80]Aggravated ― spare for days
[01:01.63]I troll downtown the red light place
[01:05.50]Jump up bubble up ― what's in store
[01:09.65]Love is the drug and I need to score
[01:13.32]Showing out showing out, hit and run
[01:16.88]Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
[01:21.02]Stitched up tight, can't shake free
[01:24.74]Love is the drug got a hook on me
[01:28.31]Oh oh catch that buzz
[01:32.52]Love is the drug I'm thinking of
[01:36.33]Oh oh can't you see
[01:40.16]Love is the drug for me
[01:43.00]
[01:59.66]Late that night I park my car
[02:02.98]Stake my place in the singles bar
[02:06.86]Face to face, toe to toe
[02:10.64]Heart to heart as we hit the floor
[02:14.79]Lumber up limbo down
[02:18.41]The locked embrace, the stumble round
[02:22.30]I say go, she say yes
[02:26.25]Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
[02:30.11]Oh oh catch that buzz
[02:33.96]Love is the drug I'm thinking of
[02:37.78]Oh oh can't you see
[02:41.50]Love is the drug with a hook in me
[02:45.43]Oh oh catch that buzz
[02:49.32]Love is the drug I'm thinking of
[02:53.13]Oh oh can't you see
[02:56.96]Love the drug for me
