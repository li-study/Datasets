[00:04.14]From the album Catching A Tiger
[00:08.15]
[00:16.32]I turned my back
[00:17.67]you were gone in a flash like you always do
[00:23.30]you always go off somewhere else
[00:32.11]and when the phone rang and I thought it was you
[00:33.79]and I sprung like a kid who just got out of school
[00:35.79]but it's almost
[00:40.17]always never you, never you
[00:47.89]I scream like a child
[00:55.45]my insides went woah
[01:03.12]
[01:04.09]and when I'm alone with you
[01:07.06]you let me feel and you let me feel
[01:12.15]when I'm alone with you
[01:15.09]you are the one and you are the one
[01:20.36]
[01:21.94]and when I reach out and I only got air
[01:23.80]and it killed me to think that you never did care
[01:25.86]and it's hopeless
[01:29.18]you always run off somewhere else
[01:38.19]I throw in a tantrum
[01:45.30]why are you such a battle?
[01:53.01]
[01:53.91]and when I'm alone with you
[01:57.15]you let me feel and you let me feel
[02:02.28]when I'm alone with you
[02:05.07]you are the one and you are the one
[02:09.59]
[02:10.02]and when I'm alone with you
[02:13.01]you let me feel and you let me feel
[02:18.05]when I'm alone with you
[02:21.05]you are the one and you are the one
[02:26.13]
[02:26.99]remind me of home when you're around me
[02:34.86]the next time you leave don't go without me
[02:42.14]no, don't go, n-no
[02:48.22]yeah
[02:52.59]
[02:53.11]you make me feel, you let me feel
[02:58.12]when I'm alone with you
[03:01.11]you are the one, you are the one
[03:06.27]when I'm alone with you
[03:09.02]you make me feel and you let me feel yeah
[03:14.07]when I'm alone with you
[03:17.08]you are the one and you are the one.
[03:21.64]
