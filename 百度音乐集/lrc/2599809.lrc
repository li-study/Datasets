[00:03.50]Coldplay
[00:05.89]
[01:12.23]There's a wild wind blowing
[01:16.59]Down the corner of my street
[01:20.20]Every night they're headlights glowing
[01:27.22]There's a cold world coming
[01:31.10]On the radio I heard
[01:34.76]Baby it's a violent world
[01:41.17]
[01:41.98]Oh love don't let me go
[01:49.21]Won't you take me where the street lights glow
[01:56.29]I can hear it coming
[02:00.36]I can hear the sire of the sound
[02:04.00]Now my feet won't touch the ground
[02:10.52]
[02:25.48]Time came a creeping
[02:29.53]Oh and time's a loaded gun
[02:33.18]Every road is a ray of light
[02:40.51]It goes on
[02:44.75]Time only can lead you on
[02:48.12]Still it's such a beautiful night
[02:54.80]Oh love don't let me go
[03:01.29]Won't you take me where the street lights glow
[03:08.51]I can hear it coming
[03:13.33]Like a serenade of sound
[03:16.96]Now my feet won't touch the ground
[03:23.05]
[03:31.58]Oh Oh Oh
[03:39.23]Gravity released me
[03:42.58]And don't ever hold me down
[03:46.21]Now my feet won't touch the ground
[03:52.39]
