[00:02.40]I'm sticking with you
[00:05.77]'Cos I'm made out of glue
[00:10.21]Anything that you might do

[00:20.17]You held up a stage coach in the rain
[00:24.85]And I'm doing the same
[00:29.83]Saw you're hanging from a tree
[00:34.78]And I made believe it was me

[01:08.41]But with you by my side I can do anything
[01:15.12]When we swing
[01:17.37]We hang past right or wrong
[01:24.12]
[01:24.39]I'll do anything for you
[01:30.23]Anything you want me too
[01:36.23]I'll do anything for you
[01:40.26]Oohoh I'm sticking with you
[01:45.46]Oohoh I'm sticking with you
[01:52.53]Oohoh I'm sticking with you
