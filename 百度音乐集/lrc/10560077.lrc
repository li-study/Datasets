[00:02.26]Such Great Heights
[00:04.99]The Postal Service
[00:06.01]Give Up
[00:07.11]by  Rong Bin
[00:20.35]I am thinking it's a sign
[00:26.57]that the freckles in our eyes
[00:31.02]are mirror images
[00:34.98]and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned.
[00:40.25]And I have to speculate
[00:47.57]that God Himself did make
[00:50.62]us into corresponding shapes
[00:56.61]like puzzle pieces from the clay.
[01:00.97]And true it may seem like a stretch
[01:08.00]but it's thoughts like this that catch
[01:10.97]my troubled head when you're away
[01:16.63]and when I am missing you to death.
[01:21.07]And when you are out there on the road
[01:27.33]for several weeks of shows
[01:31.15]and when you scan the radio
[01:36.19]I hope this song will guide you home.
[01:41.37]they will see us waving from such great heights
[01:49.32]"come down now" they'll say
[02:01.36]but everything looks perfect from far away
[02:10.94]"come down now" but we'll stay
[02:21.11]I tried my best to leave
[02:28.13]this all on your machine
[02:33.19]but the persistent beat
[02:36.14]it sounded thin upon the sending.
[02:42.15]and that frankly will not fly
[02:49.52]you'll hear the shrillest highs
[02:53.55]and lowest lows with the windows down
[02:58.62]and this is guiding you home.
[03:01.88]they will see us waving from such great heights
[03:10.48]"come down now" they'll say
[03:22.24]but everything looks perfect from far away
[03:31.52]"come down now" but we'll stay
