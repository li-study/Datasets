[00:00.95]So lately, been wondering
[00:05.00]Who will be there to take my place
[00:09.32]When I'm gone you'll need love
[00:13.46]To light the shadows on your face
[00:18.79]If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
[00:27.14]Then between the sand and stone
[00:31.37]Could you make it on your own
[00:34.12]
[00:35.07]If I could, then I would
[00:39.08]I'll go wherever you will go
[00:43.33]Way up high or down low
[00:47.53]I'll go wherever you will go
[00:51.91]
[00:52.20]And maybe, I'll find out
[00:56.14]A way to make it back someday
[01:00.40]To watch you, to guide you
[01:04.65]Through the darkest of your days
[01:09.40]If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
[01:18.30]Then I hope there's someone out there
[01:22.58]Who can bring me back to you
[01:25.28]
[01:26.13]If I could, then I would
[01:30.21]I'll go wherever you will go
[01:34.48]Way up high or down low
[01:38.77]I'll go wherever you will go
[01:43.42]
[01:45.02]Run away with my heart
[01:48.91]Run away with my hope
[01:53.17]Run away with my love
[01:56.44]
[02:00.41]I know now, just quite how
[02:04.38]My life and love might still go on
[02:08.74]In your heart, in your mind
[02:12.84]I'll stay with you for all of time
[02:17.07]
[02:17.28]If I could, then I would
[02:21.43]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:25.63]Way up high or down low
[02:29.88]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:34.07]
[02:34.45]If I could turn back time
[02:38.75]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:43.09]If I could make you mine
[02:47.91]I'll go wherever you will go
[02:56.55]I'll go wherever you will go
