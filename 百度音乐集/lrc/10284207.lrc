[00:32.78]For my sweetheart the melancholic
[00:36.67]You have crossed the River Styx
[00:40.55]And the waves have taken you away
[00:45.23]
[00:48.32]As I lay my head on your chest
[00:52.24]I can hear it in your veins
[00:56.11]Wake me up when you come to bed
[01:00.94]
[01:01.61]So toughen up
[01:05.01]Biko toughen up

[01:16.76]
[01:16.95]You're not doing this alone
[01:19.12]
[01:19.32]Was my love not strong enough to
[01:23.34]Bring you back from the dead

[01:34.71]
[01:34.92]So I've been writing these songs for you
[01:39.14]To steal you from your grave
[01:42.82]We can dance in a front row again

[02:29.29]Remember that when the darkness looms
[02:34.64]
[02:34.96]You're not doing this alone
[02:37.02]
[02:37.28]Every tear you shed is cleansing
[02:41.09]Taking the pain away from you
[02:44.81]I left you blueberries in the fridge
[02:48.59]The little thing that I can do
[02:51.05]
[02:51.31]So toughen up
