[00:15.74]Crow Jane
[00:39.47]Horrors in her head
[00:43.32]That her tongue dare not name
[00:47.30]She lives alone by the river
[00:51.37]The rolling rivers of pain
[00:55.76]Crow Jane Crow Jane

[01:11.38]There is one shining eye on a hard-hat
[01:15.35]The company closed down the mine
[01:19.44]Winking on waters they came
[01:23.20]Twenty hard-hats, twenty eyes
[01:27.05]In her clapboard shack
[01:30.92]Only six foot by five
[01:35.24]They killed all her whiskey
[01:39.00]And poured their pistols dry

[02:34.31]Why you close up shop so late?
[02:38.20]Just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird
[02:42.07]Measured .32, .44, .38
[02:45.90]I asked that girl which road she was taking
[02:49.70]She said she was walking the road of hate
[02:53.52]But she stopped on a coal-trolley up to New Haven

[03:09.69]Crow Jane Ah hah huh
[03:17.04]Your guns are drunk and smoking
[03:21.06]They've followed you right back to your gate
[03:25.21]Laughing all the way back from the new town
[03:28.95]Population, now, 28
[03:33.16]Crow Jane Crow Jane
