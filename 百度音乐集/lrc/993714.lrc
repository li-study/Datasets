[00:22.58]And you talked like you knew me
[00:24.65]Kept coming around and I fell for ya, yeah
[00:29.28]Then as time kept going I notice somethings
[00:32.62]Said our love kept growing
[00:34.59]Wanted to runaway cause the situation's in the past
[00:37.95]Love never really last
[00:39.56]Memories just had a hold of me
[00:42.03]But I had to let go of the pain

[01:11.84]Sitting alone all shocked up waiting for my destiny
[01:15.03]Hearing songs on the radio wishing that could happen to me, oh no
[01:21.48]Then when you came into the picture then I knew quickly
[01:25.06]That we could build something so strong
[01:28.24]Expect the best for the future
[01:30.27]Forget about what used to be
[01:31.85]I need you here all life long
[01:34.37]But I had to let go of the pain
[01:37.91]Let love rain down on me (let it rain)

[02:07.67]All day and all night is never too much (All that were how)
[02:14.53]Afraid of my feelings and falling too deep
[02:20.58]But everybodys had this happen one time or another
[02:24.39]When you need someone to set your heart free
[02:27.54]But I had to let go of the pain
