[00:17.36]Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
[00:23.25]Take me to some twilight land
[00:27.84]Where all but love is grey
[00:31.03]Where I can't find my way
[00:33.82]Without her as my guide
[00:38.91]Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
[00:44.20]Daylight comes our heaven turned to hell
[00:49.39]Am I left to burn and burn eternally
[00:55.57]She's a mystery to me
[01:00.56]She's a mystery girl
[01:05.85]She's a mystery girl
[01:06.53]In the night of love words tangled in her hair
[01:12.31]Words soon to disappear
[01:16.06]A love so sharp it cut
[01:19.15]Like a switchblade to my heart
[01:21.94]Words tearing me apart
[01:27.03]She tears again my bleeding heart
[01:31.49]I want to run she's pulling me apart
[01:36.98]Fallen angel cry then I just melt away
[01:43.06]She's a mystery to me
[01:48.14]She's a mystery girl
[01:53.43]She's a mystery girl
[01:58.92]She's a mystery girl
[02:04.31]She's a mystery girl
[02:15.18]Haunted by her side
[02:18.28]It's the darkness in her eyes
[02:20.97]That so intrigues me
[02:25.66]But if my love is blind
[02:29.15]Then I don't want to see
[02:31.66]She's a mystery to me
[02:36.93]Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
[02:42.42]Daylight comes our heaven turned to hell
[02:47.31]Am I left to burn and burn eternally
[02:53.40]She's a mystery to me
