[00:01.00]Poema - Feel The Same Way
[00:04.00]
[00:14.75]There’s something in the way you say my name
[00:19.31]That makes me sure that
[00:21.70]The feelings that your feeling are the same
[00:25.70]As the ones that I have for you
[00:31.32]I adore you
[00:34.98]
[00:39.15]The time we spend together never lasts
[00:43.61]As long as I’d like
[00:46.24]And every day the sun goes down too fast
[00:49.57]Sit here for as much time as you can get
[00:54.22]You and me watching the sunset
[00:59.33]
[01:03.72]Cause every time I see your face
[01:06.11]My heart leaps and I melt inside
[01:10.59]And every time you talk to me
[01:12.62]I have a hard time seeing past those eyes
[01:16.36]And all I want is for you to say
[01:25.26]“Darling, I feel the same way as you”
[01:32.55]
[01:34.84]There’s times when you don’t feel like talking on the phone
[01:39.07]But still you listen and
[01:41.85]You walk me to my door when you take my home
[01:45.63]You lean closer and then you kiss me
[01:49.27]And say that ‘till tomorrow you’ll miss me
[01:54.87]
[01:59.12]Cause every time I see your face
[02:01.65]My heart leaps and I melt inside
[02:06.08]And every time you talk to me
[02:08.13]I have a hard time seeing past those eyes
[02:12.29]And all I want is for you to say
[02:20.98]“Darling, I feel the same way as you”
[02:28.11]“Darling, I feel the same way as you”
[02:34.41]
[02:36.65]Sit here for as much time as we can get
[02:40.39]You and me watching the sunset
[02:45.24]It can’t get much better that this
[02:49.01]
[02:50.12]Cause every time I see your face
[02:52.48]My heart leaps and I melt inside
[02:56.73]And every time you talk to me
[02:59.03]I have a hard time seeing past those eyes
[03:03.14]And all I want is for you to say
[03:11.59]“Darling, I feel the same way as you”
[03:16.43]“Darling, I feel the same way as you”
[03:25.65]
