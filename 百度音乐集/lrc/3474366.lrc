[00:08.21]
[00:10.21]Hey!
[00:15.85](Hey, hey,)
[00:19.55]Yeah, Yeah (Yeah!)
[00:27.30]Yeah, Yeah (Yeah!)
[00:33.30]
[00:35.34]I've got a wound that doesn't heal,
[00:41.27]Burning out again,
[00:45.14]Burning out again
[00:49.04]
[00:51.01]I've not sure which of me is real,
[00:56.98]And I'm alone again,
[01:00.87]Burning out again
[01:04.58]
[01:05.80]My hope runs underneath it all,
[01:09.52]The day that I'll be home
[01:14.01]
[01:14.60]It won't be long, I belong,
[01:18.63]Somewhere past the setting sun
[01:22.58]Find me free, find me strong,
[01:26.55]Somewhere back where I belong
[01:30.60]Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)
[01:38.49]Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)
[01:44.17]
[01:46.47]Something shared with me again,
[01:52.17]But I'm not buying it,
[01:56.17]I'm not buying it
[02:00.24]
[02:02.23]My wound goes deeper than the skin,
[02:08.13]There's no hiding it,
[02:11.74]So I'm not trying it
[02:15.73]
[02:16.98]My hope runs underneath it all,
[02:20.74]The day that I'll be home,
[02:24.99]
[02:25.70]It won't be long, I belong,
[02:29.76]Somewhere past the setting sun,
[02:33.72]Find me free, find me strong,
[02:37.77]Somewhere back where I belong
[02:41.81]Yeah, Yeah, (Somewhere past the setting sun!)
[02:49.72]Yeah, Yeah, (Yeah!)
[02:57.59]Yeah, Yeah, (Going back where we belong!)
[03:05.55]Yeah, Yeah, (I'll find you,)
[03:09.65](The setting sun!)
[03:12.64]
[03:13.46]Let the weak say I am strong, and it won't be long,
[03:21.46]Let the rat say I was wrong, and it won't be wrong,
[03:29.26]Let us find where we belong,
[03:33.81]Beyond the setting sun,
[03:37.70]Beyond the setting sun
[03:40.79]
[03:41.24]Yeah, Yeah,
[03:46.60]
[03:48.83]It won't be long, I belong,
[03:52.79]Somewhere past the setting sun,
[03:56.82]Find me free, find me strong,
[04:00.72]Somewhere back where I belong
[04:04.73]Yeah, Yeah (Yeah, Yeah!)
[04:12.72]Yeah, Yeah (Yeah, Yeah!)
[04:22.30]
