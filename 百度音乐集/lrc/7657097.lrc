[00:06.01]Through Her Eyes
[00:09.51](live)
[00:14.98]Dream Theater
[00:17.48]
[00:41.83]She never really had a chance
[00:45.88]On that fateful moonlit night
[00:50.14]Sacrificed without a fight
[00:53.64]A victim of her circumstance
[00:58.01]
[00:58.89]Now that I’ve become aware
[01:02.28]And I’ve exposed this tragedy
[01:06.98]A sadness grows inside of me
[01:09.94]It all seems so unfair
[01:13.77]
[01:15.08]I’m learning all about my life
[01:20.33]By looking through her eyes
[01:25.36]
[01:39.36]Just beyond the churchyard gates
[01:43.41]Where the grass is overgrown
[01:47.89]I saw the writing on her stone
[01:51.94]I felt like I would suffocate
[01:55.44]
[01:55.98]Inloving memory of our child
[02:00.14]So innocent, eyes open wide
[02:04.30]I felt so empty as I cried
[02:07.69]Like part of me had died
[02:12.72]
[02:13.38]I’m learning all about my life
[02:17.53]By looking through her eyes
[02:22.24]
[02:22.61]And as her image
[02:25.13]Wandered through my head
[02:28.74]I wept just like a baby
[02:32.23]As I lay awake in bed
[02:35.95]
[02:37.59]And I know what it’s like
[02:40.77]To lose someone you love
[02:44.92]And this felt just the same
[02:51.72]
[02:54.12]She wasn’t given any choice
[02:57.63]Desperation stole her voice
[03:01.32]I’ve been given so much more in life
[03:05.15]I’ve got a son, I’ve got a wife
[03:10.41]
[03:10.63]I had to suffer one last time
[03:14.34]To grieve for her and say goodbye
[03:18.60]Relive the anguish of my past
[03:22.22]To find out who I was at last
[03:26.26]
[03:27.57]The door has opened wide
[03:32.50]I’m turning with the tide
[03:36.43]Looking through her eyes
[03:41.59]
[03:43.39]在那月光皎潔，決定命運的夜晚，她不曾有任何挽回的機會，
[03:46.89]毫無反抗下犧牲，成了命運的犧牲品
[03:50.07]如今我已全然了解，我曾經置身於一場悲劇當中，
[03:53.24]一股哀傷油然而生，一切似乎是那麼的不公平！
[03:56.41]經由她的眼神，我透視了我的前生
[03:59.47]毗鄰教堂大門的後院，那兒雜草叢生，
[04:03.85]看到墓碑上的墓誌銘，我覺得如同要窒息！
[04:07.68]在我孩子可愛的記憶中，他們張著大眼多麼天真無邪！
[04:11.83]我因空虛而飲泣，如同死亡的是屬於我的一部份！
[04:16.43]從她的眼神中，我知道了自己的前世
[04:19.82]當她的影像在我的腦海中徘迴時，我哭得像小孩一般，躺在床上無法入眠！
[04:23.64]我能想像你失去所愛的感覺，如今我的感覺正是如此！
[04:28.46]她不曾被給予任何機會，絕望(指Julian的絕望)奪走了她的生命。我有老婆，孩子
[04:32.07]在這一生當中老天爺賜予我這麼多。在我的前世曾有過這麼悲慘的遭遇，
[04:35.24]哀悼她並向她道別，再次經歷前輩子的痛苦，我終於了解到前世我是誰！
[04:41.70]靈魂的大門敞開，透過她的眼神，我的心緒如潮汐般的起落！
