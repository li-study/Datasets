[00:16.50]Giving up  why should I
[00:21.49]we've come to far to forget
[00:24.38]we're beautiful  we just got lost
[00:29.11]somewhere along the way
[00:31.91]so much was missing when you went away
[00:37.67]Let's start from here  lose the past
[00:41.61]change our minds  we don't need a finish line
[00:47.14]let's take this chance not think too deep
[00:50.98]of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
[00:55.09]I don't care where we go
[01:00.19]Let's start from here
[01:05.39]
[01:13.93]standing here face to face
[01:18.67]a finger on your lips
[01:21.35]don't say a word don't make a sound
[01:26.42]silence surrounds us now
[01:28.77]even when you were gone I felt you everywhere
[01:34.83]Let's start from here  lose the past
[01:38.69]change our minds  we don't need a finish line
[01:44.36]let's take this chance not think too deep
[01:48.15]of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
[01:52.19]I don't care where we go
[01:57.23]Let's start from here
[02:02.57]Let's start from here
[02:09.30]I've never been the one to open up
[02:13.55]but you've always been the voive within
[02:17.54]the only warmth from my cold heart
[02:24.40]Let's start from here, lose the past
[02:28.17]change our minds  we don't need a finish line
[02:33.73]let's take this chance not think too deep
[02:37.58]of all those promises
[02:39.78]Let's start from here  lose the past
[02:43.47]change our minds
[02:45.34]we don't need a finish line
[02:48.96]let's take this chance not think too deep
[02:52.87]of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
[02:56.90]I don't care where we go
[03:01.80]Let's start from here
[03:06.68]Let's start from here
[03:13.21]Let's start from here
[03:21.61]Let's start from here
