[00:-1.00]

[00:16.00]
[00:16.76]To kiss and tell
[00:18.59]It's just not my style.
[00:20.55]But the night is young,
[00:22.49]And it's been a while.
[00:24.65]And she broke my heart,
[00:26.32]Broke it right in two.
[00:28.42]And it's fixing time,
[00:30.35]But I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to
[00:35.55]Find, find somebody new.
[00:40.46]I wanna kiss a girl,
[00:42.33]I wanna hold her tight,
[00:44.29]And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
[00:48.26]Don't wanna go too far
[00:50.65]Just to take it slow,
[00:52.36]But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world.
[00:57.81]I wanna kiss a girl.
[01:00.34]
[01:08.35]It's that moment when
[01:10.15]You start closing in.
[01:12.10]First you're holding back,
[01:13.93]Then surrendering.
[01:16.18]It can start a fire,
[01:18.10]Light up the sky.
[01:19.96]Such a simple thing,
[01:21.89]Do you wanna try?
[01:25.03]Are you ready to
[01:26.97]Say goodbye
[01:29.24]To all these blues?
[01:32.00]I wanna kiss a girl,
[01:33.87]I wanna hold her tight,
[01:35.83]And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
[01:39.88]Don't wanna go too far
[01:42.20]Just to take it slow,
[01:44.05]But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world.
[01:49.41]I wanna kiss a girl.
[01:52.57]
[01:54.64]'Cause, baby, tonight
[01:56.88]It could turn into the rest of our lives.
[02:00.92]Oh yeah.
[02:02.71]Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
[02:04.82]Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
[02:06.89]To cross that yellow line?
[02:08.98]Put your lips on mine.
[02:12.58]
[02:17.72]Put your lips on mine, baby.
[02:20.82]
[02:25.74]Do you wanna try?
[02:28.61]Are you ready to
[02:30.50]Say goodbye
[02:32.55]To all these blues?
[02:37.55]I wanna kiss a girl,
[02:39.46]I wanna hold her tight,
[02:41.38]And maybe make a little magic, baby.
[02:44.31]
[02:45.23]Don't wanna go too far
[02:47.66]Just to take it slow,
[02:49.84]I don't want to be lonely,
[02:51.67]I shouldn't be lonely.
[02:53.38]I wanna kiss a girl,
[02:55.23]I wanna hold her tight,
[02:57.24]And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
[03:01.08]Don't wanna go too far
[03:03.55]Just to take it slow,
[03:05.48]But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world.
[03:10.29]I wanna kiss a girl.
[03:13.08]
[03:18.42]I said I wanna kiss a girl.
[03:22.42]Whoa-ho whoa-ho
[03:26.14]I wanna kiss a girl.
[03:29.15]I wanna hold her tight,
[03:31.13]I wanna make a little magic
[03:34.50]Out under the moonlight.
[03:36.88]
[03:42.98]Oooh I wanna kiss her now..
[03:44.74]
