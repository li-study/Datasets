[00:02.45]John Mayer - In Repair
[00:12.86]Lyric Upload by: Mantak
[00:13.78]
[00:28.35]Too many shadows in my room
[00:34.87]Too many hours in this midnight
[00:41.56]Too many corners in my mind
[00:48.18]So much to do to set my heart right
[00:53.14]
[00:53.79]It's taking so long
[00:58.78]I could be wrong, I could be ready
[01:08.34]But if I take my heart's advice
[01:12.03]I should assume it's still unsteady
[01:19.77]I am in repair
[01:24.05]
[01:34.55]Stood on the corner for a while
[01:41.26]To wait for the wind to blow down on me
[01:47.76]Hoping it takes with it my old ways
[01:54.85]And brings some brand new luck upon me
[01:59.93]
[02:01.39]It's taken so long
[02:05.09]I could be wrong, I could be ready
[02:14.51]But if I take my heart's advice
[02:19.51]I should assume it's still unsteady
[02:26.34]I am in repair
[02:38.99]
[03:40.29]And now I'm walking in the park
[03:46.73]And all of the birds, they dance below me
[03:53.54]Maybe when things turn green again
[03:59.82]It will be good to say you know me
[04:05.46]
[04:07.39]It's taken so long
[04:10.65]I could be wrong, I could be ready
[04:19.79]But if I take my heart's advice
[04:25.39]I should assume it's still unsteady
[04:33.40]I'm never really ready
[04:46.59]I'm in repair
[04:49.51]I'm not together but I'm getting there
