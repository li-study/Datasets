[00:04.19]Down down
[00:06.03](down down)
[00:07.43]
[00:08.30]Here I am with all these questions hanging from a ceiling low
[00:12.21]One by one they all keep telling me I told you so
[00:15.94]Everywhere I turn I see red lights flashing over my head
[00:19.60]Oh no, oh no, oh no
[00:22.26]
[00:23.73]In a world that's spinning round but somehow it knocked me off my feet
[00:27.52]But I know better than to let it get the best of me
[00:31.85]I could give up, I could stay stuck, I could move on
[00:37.01]
[00:37.62]So I put one foot in front of the other
[00:41.52]No no no nothing's gonna break my stride
[00:45.20]I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting
[00:49.11]Until I make it to the other side of down, down, down
[00:57.57]Whoa oh oh down
[01:01.34](Down, down, down, down)
[01:05.00]
[01:05.85]In the sky I'm standing under all I see is endless rain
[01:09.75]I think I spot a silver lining hiding in the grey
[01:13.62]I might get tossed around but I'm always bouncing back
[01:17.09]Oh oh, oh oh
[01:19.95]
[01:21.91]I could give up, I could stay stuck, but I could move on
[01:27.00]
[01:27.63]So I put one foot in front of the other
[01:31.39]No no no nothing's gonna break my stride
[01:35.17]I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting
[01:39.12]Until I make it to the other side of down, down, down
[01:47.67]Whoa oh oh oh
[01:50.56]Down, down, down, whoa oh oh oh down yeahh
[01:58.28]
[01:59.10]On the other other side of down
[02:02.10]It keeps calling me
[02:04.44]Where I wanna be on the other side of down
[02:09.62]It keeps calling me
[02:12.11]Where I wanna be,
[02:15.61]
[02:17.40]Where I wanna be
[02:19.86]
[02:20.74]Oh I put one foot in front of the other
[02:25.20]No no no nothing's gonna break my stride
[02:28.90]I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting
[02:32.84]Until I make it to the other side of down, down, down
[02:41.44]Whoa oh oh down
[02:44.24]Down, down, down,
[02:49.30]Whoa oh down
[02:52.80]Oh down, down,
[02:56.32]Oh down, down,
