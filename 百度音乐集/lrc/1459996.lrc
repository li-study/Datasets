[00:21.25]Crucify my love
[00:26.16]If my love is blind
[00:29.74]Crucify my love
[00:33.31]If it sets me free

[00:55.19]When the wind crles
[00:58.33]I'll say good-bye

[01:05.09]To reach out for eternity
[01:08.23]Where's the answer
[01:11.18]Is this forever
[01:25.55]Like a river flowing to the sea
[01:32.16]You'll be miles away, and I will know
[01:38.14]I know I can deal with the pain
[01:44.93]No reason to cry
[01:49.60]Crucify my love
[01:52.61]If my love is blind

[02:05.80]"That love should see a color"
[02:08.47]Crucify my love
[02:11.66]If it should be that way
[02:52.69]Till the loneliness shadows the sky
[02:59.61]I'll be sailing down and I will know
[03:05.58]I know I can clear clouds away
[03:11.10]Oh is it a crime to love
[03:20.90]Swing the heartache
[03:24.86]Feel it inside out
[03:28.03]When the wind crles
[03:31.26]I'll say good-bye
[03:34.50]Tried to learn Tried to find
[03:38.12]To reach out for eternity
[03:41.03]Where's the answer
[03:43.54]Is this forever
[03:47.15]If my love is blind
[03:50.18]Crucify my love
[03:53.33]If it sets me free
[03:56.56]Never know Never trust
