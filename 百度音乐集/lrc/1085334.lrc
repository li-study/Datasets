[00:24.81]Sleeping in your bed of lies
[00:27.13].
[00:27.75]If you''re gonna do stuff
[00:29.38]Then you should''ve cleaned it up
[00:31.06]If you needed more love
[00:32.31]Then you should of just spoke up
[00:34.19]Instead of posing, making me think everything was fine.

[00:50.31]But this time I really mean it, I''m done

[01:38.94]''Cause I packed my clothes
[01:40.50]All my stuff is in the trunk
[01:42.25]You would''ve seen dust
[01:43.69]If you hadn''t just pulled up
[01:45.69].
