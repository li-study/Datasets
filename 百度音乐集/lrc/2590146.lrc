[00:34.24]It doesn\'t hurt me.
[00:38.06]You want to feel, how it feels?
[00:43.34]You want to know, know that it doesn\'t hurt me?
[00:48.42]You want to hear about the deal I\'m making.

[01:15.66]Be running up that hill,
[01:18.54]Be running up that building.

[01:32.72]You don\'t want to hurt me,
[01:36.71]But see how deep the bullet lies.
[01:41.92]Unaware that I\'m tearing you asunder.
[01:47.26]There\'s a thunder in our hearts, baby

[02:27.80]Be running up that road,
[02:30.45]Be running up that hill,
[02:32.97]Be running up that building.
[02:38.71]If I only could
[02:42.74]
[03:01.50]Come on, baby, come on, come on, darling,
[03:07.28]Let me steal this moment from you now.
[03:12.59]Come on angel, come on, come on, darling,
[03:17.94]Let\'s exchange the experience
[03:22.56]
[03:32.06]And if I only could,
[03:34.28]Make a deal with God,
[03:37.16]And get him to swap our places,
[03:42.32]Be running up that road,
[03:45.16]Be running up that hill,
[03:48.73]With no problems.
[03:52.07]

[03:55.75]Make a deal with God,
[03:58.62]And I\'d get him to swap our places,
[04:03.63]Be running up that road,
[04:06.37]Be running up that hill,
[04:09.99]With no problems.
