[00:13.30]Do you ever have that dream
[00:15.48]where you're walking naked down the street
[00:19.91]and everyone just stares
[00:25.14]Do you ever feel so deep
[00:27.41]that you speak your mind to put others straight to sleep
[00:31.42]You wonder if anybody cares
[00:36.38]Sometimes I think I'm the only one
[00:42.20]whose day turned out unlike it had begun
[00:47.76]And I feel
[00:49.23]bare naked and I
[00:51.98]just can't take it
[00:54.38]I'm getting jaded No I just can't fake it anymore
[00:59.61]'Cuz I'm
[01:01.04]bare naked
[01:02.71]And I know
[01:03.61]life's what you make it wish I could float away
[01:08.50]to some other day
[01:12.64]You ever go downstairs to start your day
[01:16.12]but your car's not there
[01:19.07]Yeah you know the joke's on you
[01:24.46]You ever try your luck with a pickup line
[01:28.19]But you just sucked
[01:30.57]You tell yourself it wasn't you
[01:35.51]And I know it's hard to hold it inside
[01:41.52]It's days like these I run and hide
[01:46.72]When I feel
[01:48.54]bare naked and I
[01:51.20]just can't take it
[01:53.50]I'm getting jaded No I just can't fake it anymore
[01:58.83]'Cuz I'm
[02:00.31]bare naked and I know
[02:03.07]life's what you make it wish I could float away
[02:07.60]to some other day
[02:11.72]It's all a state of mind
[02:13.39]but I don't mind trying to find a way
[02:16.30]to keep my head above the mess I make
[02:20.12]what the world creates
[02:21.79]sometimes it feels so good
[02:23.69]to let it all fall
[02:25.18]as the world fall
[02:26.64]I may fall
[02:27.70]we all may fall
[02:29.58]and then the world comes tumbling
[02:32.14]down down down down down
[02:35.89]Bare naked and I
[02:38.50]just can't take it
[02:40.80]I'm getting jaded No I just can't fake it anymore
[02:46.28]'Cuz I'm
[02:47.72]bare naked and I know
[02:50.46]life's what you make it wish I could float away
[02:55.20]to some other day
