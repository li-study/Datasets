[00:01.65]Woman In Love
[00:04.74]演唱：Dana Winner
[00:10.68]
[00:26.53]Life is a moment in space,
[00:30.37]when the dream is gone
[00:33.37]it's a lonelier place.
[00:38.58]I kiss the morning goodbye,
[00:42.61]but down inside you know
[00:45.61]we never know why.
[00:50.68]
[00:51.09]The road is narrow and long
[00:54.74]when eyes meet eyes
[00:57.98]and the feeling is strong.
[01:03.09]I turn away from the wall.
[01:07.08]I stumble and fall,
[01:10.26]but I give you it all.
[01:15.61]I am a woman in love
[01:19.24]and I'd do anything
[01:21.87]to get you into my world,
[01:25.76]and hold you within.
[01:28.71]It's a right I defend
[01:35.27]over and over again.
[01:41.31]What do I do?
[01:46.68]
[01:54.21]With you eternally mine,
[01:58.10]In love there is
[02:01.00]no measure of time.
[02:06.34]They planned it all at the start
[02:10.52]that you and I, live
[02:12.91]in each others heart.
[02:18.67]We may be oceans away,
[02:22.47]you feel my love
[02:25.51]I hear what you say.
[02:30.95]No truth is ever a lie.
[02:34.74]I stumble and fall,
[02:37.79]but I give you it all.
[02:43.32]I am a woman in love
[02:47.07]and I'd do anything
[02:49.32]to get you into my world,
[02:53.19]and hold you within.
[02:56.42]It's a right I defend
[03:02.79]over and over again.
[03:08.93]What do I do?
[03:13.68]
[03:20.09]I am a woman in love
[03:23.93]and I'm talkin' to you.
[03:26.46]You know how you feel
[03:30.12]what a woman can do.
[03:33.19]It's a right I defend
[03:39.71]over and over again
[03:46.62]I am a woman in love
[03:49.99]and I'd do anything
[03:52.43]to get you into my world,
[03:56.21]and hold you within.
[03:59.36]It's a right I defend
[04:05.73]over and over again
[04:12.43]I am a woman in love
[04:16.23]and I'd do anything
[04:18.48]to get you into my world,
[04:22.42]and hold you within.
[04:25.39]It's a right I defend
[04:31.90]over and over again
