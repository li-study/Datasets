[00:38.50]Little man with his eyes on fire
[00:43.50]and his smile so bright.
[00:48.50]In his hands are the toys you gave
[00:52.50]to fill his heart with delight.
[00:58.50]And in the ring stands a circus clown
[01:03.50]holding up a light.
[01:08.50]What you see and what you will hear
[01:12.50]will last you the rest of your life.
[01:15.50]
[01:16.50]And it's sad,
[01:18.50]so sad,
[01:22.50]there ain't no easy way round,
[01:26.50]And it's sad,
[01:28.50]so sad,
[01:32.50]all you friends gather round,
[01:34.50]'Cause the circus left town.
[01:37.50]
[01:56.50]Little man with his heart so pure
[02:01.50]and his love so fine.
[02:05.50]Stick with me and I'll ride with you
[02:10.50]till the end of the line.
[02:15.50]Hold my hand and I'll walk with you
[02:20.50]through the darkest night.
[02:25.50]When I smile I'll be thinking of you
[02:29.50]and everything will be all right.
[02:33.50]
[02:34.50]And it's sad,
[02:36.50]so sad,
[02:39.50]there ain't no easy way round,
[02:44.50]And it's sad,
[02:46.50]so sad,
[02:49.50]all you friends gather round,
[02:52.50]'Cause the circus left town.
[02:54.50]
[03:13.50]And it's sad,
[03:15.50]so sad,
[03:18.50]there ain't no easy way round,
[03:22.50]And it's sad,
[03:25.50]so sad,
[03:28.50]all you friends gather round,
[03:30.50]'Cause the circus left town.
