[00:02.87]Sugar Town    Nancy Sinatra
[00:10.10]I got some troubles but they won't last
[00:14.11]I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
[00:18.96]And pretty soon all my troubles will pass
[00:22.30]'cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
[00:27.14]Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
[00:34.40]I never had a dog that liked me some
[00:38.39]Never had a friend or wanted one
[00:42.85]So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
[00:46.35]'cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
[00:51.32]Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
[01:16.95]Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
[01:20.69]I heard it also rained in Tallahassee
[01:25.39]But not a drop fell on little old me
[01:28.65]'cause I was in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
[01:33.57]Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
[01:41.54]If I had a million dollars or ten
[01:45.88]I'd give to ya, world, and then
[01:48.61]You'd go away and let me spend
[01:53.25]My life in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
[01:58.26]Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
[02:06.16]la-la-la-la to end
