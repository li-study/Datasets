[00:04.67]
[00:08.29]All along, we follow blindly,
[00:11.39]Force fed prime-time, previewed nightly,
[00:14.86]Why would anybody leave the safety of their homes?
[00:20.90]
[00:24.17]I wonder why,
[00:24.71]I wonder why,
[00:25.96]Only disasters flood the headlines,
[00:29.57]Other people's misery,
[00:30.52]Are on for the next three hours,
[00:34.46]Commercial free.
[00:35.44]
[00:35.71]And I can't take much more of this,
[00:39.31]We're all so wrapped up, in it,
[00:43.45]Nothing will change, but the channels,
[00:47.53]So I turn it off.
[00:50.00]
[00:54.53]I see billboards on the horizon,
[00:57.38]I can't imagine what theyæŠ£l tell me,
[01:01.08]What to wear,
[01:02.36]What to drink,
[01:03.12]Where to eat,
[01:03.83]It's so easy not to think for yourself anymore,
[01:10.27]So naive,
[01:11.74]You don't do anything anymore.
[01:13.45]
[01:14.91]And I can't take much more of this,
[01:19.12]We're all so wrapped up, in it,
[01:24.49]Nothing will change, but the channel,
[01:28.03]And no,
[01:29.53]I can't take much more of this,
[01:33.32]We're all so wrapped up, in it,
[01:36.33]Nothing will change, but the channel...
[01:42.67]
[01:43.23]We all give in,
[01:46.74]We all complain,
[01:50.15]We sit and wait,
[01:53.47]For things to change,
[01:57.04]We're waiting,
[02:03.14]We're waiting.
[02:04.51]
[02:05.74]All along, we follow blindly,
[02:08.96]All along, we follow blindly.
[02:13.02]
[02:15.18]And I can't take much more of this,
[02:19.21]We're all so wrapped up, in it,
[02:23.19]Nothing will change, but the channel,
[02:27.97]And no,
[02:30.21]I can't take much more of this,
[02:32.98]We're all so wrapped up, in it,
[02:37.08]Nothing will change, but the channels,
[02:41.31]So I turn it off...
[02:46.95]Turn it off...
[02:50.07]--END--
