[00:02.83]Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
[00:04.97]Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
[00:07.36]It's early to rise, early in the sack
[00:09.84]Thank God, I'm A Country Boy
[00:11.47]
[00:12.05]Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
[00:14.63]A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
[00:17.07]My days are all filled with an easy country charm
[00:19.61]Thank God I'm a country boy
[00:21.22]
[00:22.93]Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
[00:24.38]When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
[00:27.02]Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
[00:29.52]Thank God I'm A country boy
[00:31.35]
[00:32.89]When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
[00:34.52]I pull out my fiddle and I rosin' up the bow
[00:37.00]The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
[00:39.65]Thank God I'm a country boy
[00:41.33]
[00:41.97]I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
[00:44.46]But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
[00:46.86]So I fiddle when I can, work when I should

[00:57.14]Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
[00:59.84]Thank God I'm A country boy
[01:01.55]
[01:22.50]Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
[01:24.85]I never was one of them money hungry fools
[01:27.26]I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
[01:29.95]Thank God I'm a country boy

[02:15.14]And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side

[02:20.40]And thank God you're a country boy"
