[00:03.11]I Want Out
[00:07.75]
[00:27.59]From our lives' beginning on
[00:30.03]We are pushed in little forms
[00:32.71]No one asks us how we like to be
[00:37.82]In school they teach you what to think
[00:40.52]But everyone says different things
[00:42.85]But they're all convinced that
[00:44.64]They're the ones to see
[00:48.07]So they keep talking and they never stop
[00:50.98]And at a certain point you give it up
[00:53.44]So the only thing that's left to think is this
[00:58.40]I want out--to live my life alone
[01:03.87]I want out--leave me be
[01:09.02]I want out--to do things on my own
[01:14.53]I want out--to live my life and to be free
[01:30.95]People tell me A and B
[01:33.24]They tell me how I have to see
[01:35.91]Things that I have seen already clear
[01:40.85]So they push me then from side to side
[01:43.56]They're pushing me from black to white
[01:46.37]They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear
[01:51.45]But don't push me to the maximum
[01:54.26]Shut your mouth and take it home
[01:56.89]'Cause I decide the way things gonna be
[02:01.62]I want out--to live my life alone
[02:06.82]I want out--leave me be
[02:12.17]I want out--to do things on my own
[02:17.42]I want out--to live my life and to be free
[02:29.56]There's a million ways to see the things in life
[02:34.36]A million ways to be the fool
[02:39.51]In the end of it, none of us is right
[02:44.79]Sometimes we need to be alone
[03:51.08]No no no, leave me alone
[03:55.54]I want out--to live my life alone
[03:59.04]I want out--leave me be
[04:02.88]I want out--to do things on my own
[04:08.73]I want out--to live my life and to be free
