[00:32.19]Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
[00:39.54]Turn down these voices inside my head
[00:47.44]Lay down with me, tell me no lies
[00:55.65]Just hold me close, don't patronize,don't patronize me
[01:11.59]Cause i can't make you love me if you don't
[01:20.13]You can't make your heart feel something it won't
[01:28.90]Here in the dark, in these lonely hours
[01:36.57]I will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
[01:43.92]But you won't, no you won't
[01:51.15]Cause i can't make you love me, if you don't
[02:10.22]
[02:14.02]I'll close my eyes, then i won't see
[02:23.29]The love you don't feel when you're holding me
[02:30.61]Morning will come and i'll do what's right
[02:38.76]Just give me till then to give up this fight
[02:46.35]And i will give up this fight
[02:56.95]Cause i can't make you love me if you don't
[03:04.31]You can't make your heart feel something it won't
[03:13.70]Here in the dark, in these lonely hours
[03:21.10]I will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
[03:28.81]But you won't, no you won't
[03:35.77]Cause i can't make you love me, if you don't
