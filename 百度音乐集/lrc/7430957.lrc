[00:02.93]
[00:06.12]The whole truth and nothing but the truth
[00:15.37]Stop me if you\'ve heard this one before
[00:18.48]The whole truth is nothing but a good excuse
[00:30.14]So long as you don\'t torture me with my past
[00:34.73]Let\'s be honest; a secret silenced is a secret safe
[00:41.44]
[00:41.95]Miami, Miami, Miami
[00:47.98]Well every hour on the hour
[00:51.13](every hour on the hour)
[00:54.68]You have to, you just have to trust me
[01:02.05]Whoever I was then,
[01:04.58]I can\'t ever be again
[01:07.72]
[01:09.35]Reminders, they are not reluctant
[01:18.63]So stop me if you\'ve heard this one before
[01:21.38]Sideways blinders,
[01:24.50]I can\'t find a way (around a way) around..
[01:32.71]
[01:33.03]Miami, Miami, Miami
[01:38.87]Well every hour on the hour (every hour on the hour)
[01:45.34]You have to, you just have to trust me
[01:51.41]Whoever I was then,
[01:53.85]I can\'t ever be again
[01:57.44]
[02:22.81]The faith you found I never felt (never felt)
[02:34.69]The terror held in wedding bells
[02:37.93]And comfort in there\'s no one else
[02:41.10]The truth be told I\'m never gonna know
[02:46.59]
[02:46.73]Miami Miami Miami
[02:52.69]Well every hour on the hour (every hour on the hour)
[02:59.38]Unhand me, God damn me, Miami
[03:05.83]Whoever I was then I can\'t ever be again
[03:11.80]
[03:12.27]The terror held in wedding bells
[03:15.27]The comfort in there\'s no one else
[03:18.35]The truth be told I\'m never gonna know
[03:24.48]The terror held in wedding bells
[03:27.49]The comfort in there\'s no one else
[03:30.71]The truth be told I\'m never gonna know
[03:36.98]
