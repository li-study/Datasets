[00:02.68]
[00:43.07]I sleep with windows open
[00:47.21]I sleep with eyes wide
[00:51.11]In case you would come walking
[00:55.87]In case you'd change your mind
[01:01.34]
[01:01.64]But don't strain yourself for me
[01:05.89]Don't break yourself for me
[01:09.98]Don't lose your selfish ways for me
[01:14.84]
[01:24.70]I keep a leash around you
[01:28.80]And I keep it nice and tight
[01:33.09]In case you would go walking
[01:37.55]Over forbidden lines
[01:43.21]
[01:43.67]But don't go all soft on me
[01:47.46]Don't come across for me
[01:51.72]Don't lose your selfish ways over me
[02:05.22]
[02:05.98]Un deux trois
[02:09.01]Quatre cinq six
[02:10.13]A hundred times around
[02:14.18]You keep on flocking out
[02:18.32]You keep me wanting more
[02:22.46]
[02:23.28]Un deux trois
[02:24.74]Quatre cinq six
[02:27.53]A hundred times is fine
[02:30.71]For you I go all line
[02:35.01]Oh my, where is my mind?
[02:37.03]
[02:56.97]I keep my window open
[03:00.81]I keep it open wide
[03:05.06]So keep me keep it open
[03:09.71]Oh, keep me on your mind
