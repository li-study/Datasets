[00:46.32]Something ugly this way comes
[00:49.26]Through my fingers sliding inside
[00:52.06]All these blessings all these burns
[00:55.25]I'm godless underneath your cover
[00:57.75]Search for pleasure search for pain
[01:00.58]In this world now I am undying
[01:03.75]I unfurl my flag my nation helpless
[01:07.07]Black black heart why would you offer more
[01:12.57]Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
[01:18.44]I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
[01:23.89]I'm eating all your kings and queens
[01:27.65]All your sex and your diamonds
[01:31.59]
[01:43.17]As I begin to lose my grip
[01:45.89]On these realities your sending
[01:48.88]Taste your mind and taste your sex
[01:51.77]I'm naked underneath your cover
[01:54.38]Covers lie and we will bend and borrow
[01:58.10]With the coming sign
[01:59.97]The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape
[02:04.11]Black black heart why would you offer more
[02:09.34]Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
[02:15.24]I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
[02:20.70]I'm eating all your kings and queens
[02:24.54]All your sex and your diamonds
[02:29.35]
[02:52.31]Black black heart why would you offer more
[02:57.72]Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
[03:03.50]I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
[03:09.02]I'm eating all your kings and queens
[03:12.80]All your sex and your diamonds
[03:18.72]All your sex and your diamonds
[03:24.14]All your sex and your diamonds
[03:29.79]All your sex and your diamonds
[03:35.45]All your sex and your diamonds
