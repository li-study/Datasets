[00:05.99]
[00:12.21]I hear some people been talkin\' me down,
[00:17.61]Bring up my name, pass it \'round.
[00:23.96]They don\'t mention happy times
[00:29.40]They do their thing, i\'ll do mine.
[00:34.47]
[00:35.71]Ooh baby, that\'s hard to change
[00:41.03]I can\'t tell them how to feel.
[00:46.71]Some get stoned, some get strange,
[00:53.04]But sooner or later it all gets real.
[00:57.91]
[00:58.52]Walk on, walk on,
[01:03.45]Walk on, walk on.
[01:07.51]
[01:20.90]I remember the good old days,
[01:25.78]Stayed up all night gettin\' crazed.
[01:31.54]Then the money was not so good,
[01:37.04]But we still did the best we could.
[01:41.55]
[01:43.07]Ooh baby, that\'s hard to change
[01:48.92]I can\'t tell them how to feel.
[01:54.28]Some get stoned, some get strange,
[02:00.25]But sooner or later it all gets real.
[02:04.59]
[02:04.93]Walk on, walk on,
[02:10.39]Walk on, walk on.
[02:55.89]Some get stoned, some get strange,
[03:07.61]Walk on, walk on,
