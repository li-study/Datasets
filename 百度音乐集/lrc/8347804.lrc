[00:00.80]by Svensson, Persson, Larson
[00:01.56]Editor:湮没
[00:03.16]
[00:17.30]Burn it all and break your home
[00:20.96]This one's for the boys
[00:25.34]You're a vain and shameless man
[00:28.63]But hell, i love your voice
[00:31.44]
[00:41.32]Skinny fingers and mumbling mouths
[00:44.72]I'd like to mark your words
[00:48.70]'cause sometimes i don't trust you
[00:52.78]When you're singing
[00:55.33]Of love and play
[00:56.86]It's the story of you
[00:59.23]Losing to your daydream
[01:02.55]You dancing with a smokescreen
[01:06.24]Goin'under with your daydream
[01:10.60]In the wake of the big machine
[01:15.00]
[01:22.21]Honey honey and money and man
[01:25.70]All my lonely boys
[01:30.39]Easy with the slight of hand
[01:33.52]You're talking sweet
[01:35.79]'bout the pain and the ladies
[01:37.42]And sometimes you look ugly
[01:41.01]When you're happy
[01:43.65]And sometimes you look better
[01:46.68]When you're down
[01:49.70]A real good song
[01:51.34]It's the story of you
[01:53.68]Losing to your daydream
[01:57.36]You dancing with a smokescreen
[02:01.19]Goin' under with your daydream
[02:05.35]You're sliding through the big sleep
[02:09.33]
[02:09.51]Man, you can sing
[02:12.84]Like you're tryin' to break my heart
[02:18.22]And you can hate
[02:20.69]And you can blame it on the stars
[02:26.39]You're strung up in your guitar
[02:30.31]You're strung out on who you are
[02:34.34]Now come on boys, it's time you let it go
[02:39.91]
[02:54.19]See me losing to your daydream
[02:58.17]See me dancing with your smokescreen
[03:02.02]Going under with your daydream
[03:05.87]
[03:06.54]In the wake of the big machine
[03:12.50]In the wake of the big machine
[03:18.63]In the wake of the big machine
