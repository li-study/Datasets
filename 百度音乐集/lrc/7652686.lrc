[00:00.20]Gotta Tell You
[00:00.30]Gotta Tell You
[00:00.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:11.62]Your love for me came as a waterfall
[00:15.88]Flowin' inside me like never before
[00:24.10]Your love for me
[00:22.31]Somethin' I didn't see
[00:20.22]But baby, I know better now
[00:28.95]When you walk in the room that very night
[00:33.26]A special feelin' just burst inside
[00:37.60]It was only you
[00:39.78]Nobody else
[00:41.52]But baby
[00:42.98]I know better now
[00:45.19]Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
[00:49.44]Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
[00:53.78]Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
[00:58.51]If I
[01:01.23]Didn't tell you this tonight
[01:09.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:12.35]And now you're back inside my house again
[01:16.69]I'm tryin' deeper to explain
[01:21.08]'Cause baby I
[01:23.20]Wanna get it on
[01:24.88]And baby, you're the one for me
[01:29.78]But now that I have got you all alone
[01:34.12]After all this talkin' on the phone
[01:38.46]I should be strong
[01:40.53]There's nothing wrong
[01:42.28]I'll tell you this is where you belong
[01:45.60]where you belong
[01:46.25]Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
[01:50.40]Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
[01:54.75]Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
[01:59.38]If I
[02:02.10]Didn't tell you this tonight
[02:03.46]Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
[02:07.77]Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
[02:12.06]Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
[02:16.68]If I
[02:19.45]Didn't tell you this tonight
[02:22.92]It was just something in your eyes
[02:28.05]That made me realize
[02:30.99]But now I hear voices deep inside
[02:36.84]Tellin' me
[02:39.00]Tellin' me
[02:40.80]Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
[02:44.68]Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
[02:48.97]Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
[02:53.64]If I
[02:56.38]Didn't tell you this tonight
[02:57.65]Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
[03:02.06]Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
[03:06.37]Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
[03:10.99]If I
[03:13.71]Didn't tell you this tonight
