[00:04.59]Chevelle
[00:06.69]
[00:11.92]To pick up the tip doesn’t mean a lot
[00:17.45]Fiddle inside your drawers
[00:22.32]If we own the night then spread it out
[00:27.50]Or pack up without a clue
[00:30.06]
[00:32.36]Well, caused by their own
[00:36.67]And by default
[00:39.03]Time to vamanos
[00:42.80]Like your face getting forced to the floor
[00:50.17]
[00:53.61]I got a taste of the benefits
[00:59.11]Five foot and change
[01:03.64]There’s no better way to hash it out
[01:09.09]So let’s set up your time to bail
[01:11.65]
[01:14.06]Well, course now the cracks
[01:17.99]Should we intervene
[01:20.40]I hold this albatross
[01:24.66]Like your face getting forced to the floor
[01:34.61]And either way you’re way too close to it all
[01:41.98]
[01:46.17]Pay up, never wait ‘em out
[01:51.24]Clever, madoff take it all
[01:59.82]take it all
[02:01.62]
[02:07.73]Your mouth blessed
[02:15.27]Take ‘em all the way right back down
[02:28.65]Clueless mess
[02:37.04]Pay up, never take it all
[02:44.17]Take it all
[02:46.17]
[02:49.59]Like your face getting forced to the floor
[02:56.36]In a league of your own
[02:59.48]And either way
[03:02.78]You’re way to close to it all
[03:06.54]You cannot veto the world
[03:09.16]
[03:10.02]Like your face getting forced to the floor
[03:17.10]In a league of your own
[03:20.07]And either way
[03:23.73]You’re way to close to it all
[03:28.64]
[03:30.24]Too close to it all
[03:35.45]
