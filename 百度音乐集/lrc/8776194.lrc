[01:27.60]----《电车男》主题曲
[01:28.74]The visions dancing in my mind
[01:31.90]The early dawn,the shades of time
[01:35.43]Twilight crawling through my windowpane
[01:42.22]Am I awake or do I dream?
[01:45.57]The strangest pictures I have seen
[01:49.18]Night is day and twilight’s gone away
[01:54.99]With your head held high and your scarlet lies
[01:58.16]You came down to me from the open skies
[02:02.11]It’s either real or it’s a dream
[02:03.78]There’s nothing that is in between...
[02:05.86]Twilight
[02:08.21]I only meant to stay awhile
[02:12.66]Twilight
[02:15.00]I gave you time to steal my mind
[02:18.56]Away from me.
[02:27.09]Across the night I saw your face
[02:30.44]You disappeared without a trace
[02:33.97]You brought me here,
[02:35.48]but can you take me back?]
[02:40.77]Inside the image of your light
[02:44.13]That now is day and once was night
[02:47.56]You lead me here and then you go away.
[03:00.27]It’s either real or it’s a dream
[03:02.14]There’s nothing that is in between...
[03:04.20]Twilight
[03:11.15]Twilight
[03:13.89]I gave you time to steal my mind
[03:16.95]Away from me.
[03:29.38]you brought me here,
[03:31.28]but can you take me back again? ]
[03:37.48]With your head held high and your scarlet lies
[03:40.35]You came down to me from the open skies
[03:44.51]It’s either real or it’s a dream
[03:46.16]There’s nothing that is in between...
[03:48.07]Twilight
[03:50.46]I only meant to stay awhile
[03:54.83]Twilight
[03:57.46]I gave you time to steal my mind
[04:05.36]Twilight
[04:07.88]I only meant to stay awhile
[04:12.04]Twilight
[04:14.56]I only meant to stay awhile
[04:25.92]Twilight, twilight, twilight, twilight.
