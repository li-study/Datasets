[00:12.30]you say you wanna die
[00:17.87]cuz the things don't work out right
[00:23.02]but you don't even try
[00:27.66]though neither do i
[00:32.06]and neither do my friends
[00:36.27]though some of them pretend
[00:40.50]and it's easy if you cry
[00:45.01]cuz you feel bad for yourself
[00:51.97]i think about my friend who died
[00:57.55]and how her kids didn't get to say goodbye
[01:02.47]though neither did i
[01:06.40]no neither did i
[01:12.51]but neither did my friends
[01:16.22]though some of them pretend
[01:20.49]it's easy if you cry
[01:25.20]cuz you feel bad for yourself
[01:36.55]if you pretend everything's fine
[01:43.07]i won't hurt myself or lie
[01:49.53]to you or mom or dad
[01:53.18]just pretend that i'm not sad
[01:58.60]and we'll work everything out
[02:02.53]even all the stuff we don't talk about
[02:08.42]it'll be easier if we cry
[02:12.24]we'll feel bad for ourselves
[02:21.66]
