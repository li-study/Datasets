[00:00.71]When you're close to tears remember
[00:05.20]someday it'll all be over
[00:09.83]One day we're gonna get so high
[00:19.20]Though it's darker than December
[00:23.77]what's ahead is a different color
[00:28.44]One day we're gonna get so high
[00:37.38]
[00:38.35]And at the end of the day remember the days
[00:41.45]when we were close to the end
[00:43.10]and wonder how we made it through the night
[00:48.06]At the end of the day
[00:49.21]we remember the way
[00:50.48]we stayed so close to the end
[00:52.83]we'll remember it was me and you
[00:56.92]Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
[01:05.17]you will always keep it flying high in the sky
[01:12.72]of love
[01:15.12]Don't you think it's time you started
[01:20.31]doing what we always wanted
[01:24.94]One day we're gonna get so high
[01:34.30]Cause even the impossible
[01:38.77]is easy when we got each other
[01:43.32]One day we're gonna get so high
[01:51.58]
[01:52.90]And at the end of the day remember the days
[01:56.13]when we were close to the end
[01:58.18]and wonder how we made it through the night
[02:03.03]At the end of the day
[02:04.26]remember the way
[02:05.35]we stayed so close to the end
[02:07.56]we'll remember it was me and you
[02:11.63]Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
[02:20.52]You will always keep it flying high in the sky
[02:27.47]of love
[02:30.34]Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
[02:39.12]You will always keep it flying high in the sky
[02:45.87]of love
[02:53.85]
[03:07.44]And at the end of the days remember the days
[03:10.63]when we were close to the end
[03:12.83]and wonder how we made it through the night
[03:17.62]At the end of the day remember the way
[03:20.01]we stayed so close to the end
[03:22.23]we'll remember it was me and you
[03:26.75]Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
[03:35.33]You will always keep it flying high in the sky
[03:41.88]of love
[04:23.23][04:04.12][03:45.12]Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
[04:31.57][04:12.87][03:54.04]You will always keep it flying high in the sky
[04:38.59][04:19.60][04:01.92]of love
