[00:19.76]Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
[00:27.02]You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
[00:35.11]Is it only cause youre lonely they have blamed you?
[00:42.74]For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?
[00:49.88]Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
[00:56.85]Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
[01:05.24]Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
[01:12.88]They just lie there and they die there
[01:21.13]Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
[01:28.97]Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?
