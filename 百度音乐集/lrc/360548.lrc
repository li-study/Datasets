[00:00.92]Another summer day
[00:02.79]Has come and gone away
[00:05.19]In Paris or Rome...
[00:07.61]But I wanna go home
[00:11.85]...uhm
[00:16.45]May be surrounded by
[00:18.21]A million people I
[00:20.72]Still feel all alone
[00:23.13]I just wanna go home
[00:27.39]I miss you, you know
[00:30.74]And I've been keeping all the letters
[00:35.49]That I wrote to you,
[00:38.53]Each one a line or two
[00:42.69]I'm fine baby, how are you?
[00:46.83]I would send them but I know that
[00:50.00]It's just not enough
[00:54.72]My words were cold and flat
[00:58.28]And you deserve more than that
[01:05.75]Another aeroplane, another sunny place,
[01:09.50]I'm lucky I know
[01:13.11]But I wanna go home
[01:15.82]I've got to go home
[01:19.70]Let me go home
[01:27.06]I'm just too far from where you are
[01:30.57]I got to come home
[01:35.37]Let me go home
[01:43.65]I've had my run
[01:45.51]Baby I'm done
[01:47.23]I wanna come home
[01:51.54]And I feel just like I'm living
[01:55.27]Someone else's life
[01:59.00]It's like I just stepped outside
[02:03.25]When everything was going right
[02:07.41]And I know just why
[02:10.79]You could not come along with me
[02:15.27]This was not your dream
[02:18.40]But you always believed in me...
[02:25.00]Another winter day
[02:28.31]Has come and gone away
[02:30.40]In either Paris or Rome
[02:32.15]And I wanna go home
[02:36.21]I miss you, you know
[02:41.27]Let me go home
[02:48.85]I've had my run
[02:51.12]Baby I'm done
[02:52.96]I wanna go home
[02:56.26]Let me go home
[03:02.77]It'll all be alright
[03:07.59]I'll be home tonight
[03:11.61]I'm coming back home
[03:16.36]
