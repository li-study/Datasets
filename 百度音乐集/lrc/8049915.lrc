[00:04.13]
[00:49.45]Fly away Fly away from this cage
[00:57.59]Far away Far away from this place
[01:05.56]This is not how it was meant to be
[01:14.43]Crammed in a tiny cage you sing to anyone
[01:17.25]who can hear your crying
[01:19.05]Scratching biting you try to get out
[01:20.99]but there is no escape
[01:22.45]
[01:22.95]Fly away Find a way to escape
[01:30.79]Free yourself Free yourself from this fate
[01:38.93]This is not how it was meant to be
[01:47.58]Inspiration from your song gives me strength
[01:50.28]and courage to break myself out
[01:52.38]Break out from this bubble and break out
[01:55.26]from this bubble
[01:57.11]And break out from this bubble and break out
[02:00.02]from this bubble
[02:12.36]
[03:30.62]Fly away Fly away from this cage
[03:39.22]Far away Far away from this place
[03:47.39]This is not how it was meant to be
[03:55.59]Inspiration from your song gives me strength
[03:58.60]and courage to break myself out
[04:00.95]Break out from this bubble and break out
[04:03.50]from this bubble
[04:05.33]And break out from this bubble and break out
[04:08.53]from this bubble....
