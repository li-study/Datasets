[00:06.12]Eric Clapton
[00:11.12]
[00:21.50]It's late in the evening
[00:26.50]She's wondering what clothes to wear
[00:31.50]She puts on her make up
[00:36.50]And brushes her long blond hair
[00:42.50]And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
[00:50.50]And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
[00:57.89]
[01:07.50]We go to a party
[01:12.50]And everyone turns to see
[01:17.50]This beautiful lady
[01:22.50]Is walking around with me
[01:27.50]And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
[01:35.50]And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
[01:43.50]
[01:45.50]I feel wonderful because I see the love
[01:52.50]Lighting in your eyes
[01:56.50]And the wonder of it all
[02:00.50]Is that you just don't realize
[02:04.50]How much I love you
[02:10.33]
[02:28.50]It's time to go home now
[02:32.50]And I've got an aching head
[02:37.50]So I give her the car keys
[02:42.50]And she helps me to bed
[02:48.50]And then I tell her
[02:52.50]As I turn off the light
[02:56.50]I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight"
[03:06.50]"Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight"
