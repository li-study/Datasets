[00:03.00]Gotye
[00:05.00]
[00:30.15]You're a fraud and you know it
[00:33.28]But it's too good to throw it all away
[00:37.72]Anyone would do the same
[00:39.64]You've got 'em going
[00:41.99]And you're careful not to show it
[00:44.36]Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
[00:47.63]It's like magic
[00:50.22]But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
[00:53.10]Anyone would do the same
[00:55.15]
[01:08.25]So now that you've arrived well you wonder
[01:12.14]What is it that you've done to make the grade
[01:16.36]And should you do the same?
[01:18.43](Is that too easy?)
[01:21.04]Are you only trying to please them
[01:23.21](Will they see then?)
[01:24.30]You're desperate to deliver
[01:26.69]Anything that could give you
[01:29.80]A sense of reassurance
[01:31.56]When you look in the mirror
[01:34.22]
[01:49.03]Such highs and lows
[01:53.31]You put on quite a show
[01:57.24]
[02:02.38]All these highs and lows
[02:06.24]And you're never really sure
[02:10.83]What you do it for
[02:12.49]Well do you even want to know?
[02:16.08]You put on quite a show
[02:20.18]
[02:33.97](Mother)
[02:36.29]Are you watching?
[02:39.23]Are you watching?
[02:42.85](Mother)
[02:44.50]Are you watching?
[02:45.57](Mother)
[02:49.30]You're a fraud and you know it
[02:53.46]And every night and day you take the stage
[02:57.16]And it always entertains
[02:59.09]You're giving pleasure
[03:01.22]And that's admirable, you tell yourself
[03:03.84]And so you'd gladly sell yourself
[03:05.60]To others
[03:06.52](Mother)
[03:08.13]Are you watching?
[03:10.42](Mother)
[03:12.55]Are you watching?
[03:13.59](Mother)
[03:15.44]Are you watching?
[03:16.42](Mother)
[03:18.30]Are you watching?
[03:20.50]Are you watching?
[03:22.56]
[03:37.18]Such highs and lows
[03:41.53]You put on quite a show
[03:45.61]
[03:49.81]All these highs and lows
[03:54.67]And you're never really sure
[03:58.57]What you do it for
[04:00.95]Well do you even want to know?
[04:05.69]Yeah you put on quite a show
[04:08.98]
