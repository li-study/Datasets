[00:06.00]豆豆，我们相爱一年了，OH YEAH
[00:17.53]Nothing\'s impossible I have found
[00:21.88]For when my chin is on the ground
[00:25.61]I pick myself up, dust myself off, start all over again
[00:32.73]
[00:34.48]Don\'t lose your confidence if you slip
[00:38.15]Be grateful for a pleasant trip
[00:42.54]And pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again
[00:51.11]Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won
[00:59.62]You may be sick and tired but you\'ll be a man my son
[01:08.50]Don\'t you remember the famous men who had to fall to rise again?
[01:16.55]They picked themselves up, dust themselves off and started all over again
[01:58.43]Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won
[02:06.16]You may be sick and tired but you\'ll be a man my son
[02:14.80]Don\'t you remember the famous men who had to fall to rise again?
[02:23.30]They picked themselves up, dust themselves off and started all over again
