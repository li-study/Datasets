[00:01.81]Time
[00:08.75]
[00:15.22]Autumn has come, I'm loosing my leaves
[00:30.18]The sand has almost ran through
[00:55.41]
[00:58.39]Run, run, run for eternal youth
[01:05.82]I must escape from my faith
[01:11.76]There is no bribery to make the mirror lie
[01:17.53]
[01:18.86]Run, run, run, run
[01:22.37]The air is getting thin
[01:25.06]
[01:25.90]Run, run, run, run
[01:29.26]The air is getting thin
[01:31.56]
[01:33.00]Run, run, run, run
[01:35.99]The air is getting thin
[01:38.39]
[01:39.69]In my life's opera, they play the final notes
[01:53.31]The happy tunes turned to minor
[02:17.48]
[02:21.22]Run, run, run for eternal youth
[02:28.58]I must escape from my faith
[02:34.41]There is no bribery to make the mirror lie
[02:40.88]
[02:41.70]Run, run, run, run
[02:45.13]The air is getting thin
[02:47.82]
[02:48.69]Run, run, run, run
[02:52.11]The air is getting thin
[02:54.30]
[02:55.76]Run, run, run, run
[02:59.15]The air is getting thin
[03:01.57]
[03:16.09]Time is hunting me, there is no way out
[03:23.48]My winter will come
[03:43.94]
[03:45.00]A long time ago the orchard in me has whithered
[03:57.35]
