[10:50.318]I went through, 8 different schools in, 12 different years
[06:49.987]That's 30 different teachers, over ten thousand different peers
[02:53.402]And I done fought in e'ryone, been suspended e'rytime
[02:56.587]Besides a few a felony, done committed e'ry crime

[15:28.423]And uhh, I used to go like house to house (man)
[05:54.805]Sleepin on couch to couch (you know)
[16:20.841]Walk around stickin out my hands, lookin for a handout
[07:48.455]Only thing I handed out was more bills
[08:53.060]Only thing pulled me out was my will
[12:37.147]God told me the sun don't chill
[03:22.094]Determined to make use of one of these skills
[11:45.894]Either that or go beat the block
[00:08.561]Ain't no way you can beat the cops
[08:14.897]Ain't no way I can beat the clock
[06:03.115]Just a matter of time shut down your shop
[04:57.570]Ohh, you stay up day and nights, livin this way of life
[01:12.836]I was +Young and Restless+
[14:57.517]+All My Children+ came and then I had a +Guiding Light+ (hey)
[09:51.236]No more of that sittin mayne (c'mon) sittin and waitin
