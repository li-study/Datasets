[00:33.63]Will it ever stop yo I don't know

[01:15.22]Now that the party is jumping
[01:17.04]With the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin'
[01:19.40]Quick to the point to the point no faking
[01:21.52]I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
[01:23.54]Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
[01:25.69]I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
[01:27.49]And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
[01:29.78]I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
[01:31.65]Rollin' in my 5.0
[01:33.32]With my rap-top down so my hair can blow
[01:35.73]The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
[01:38.21]Did you stop no I just drove by
[01:40.18]Kept on pursuing to the next stop
[01:42.30]I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
[01:44.40]The block was dead
[01:45.49]Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
[01:48.41]Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
[01:50.30]Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
[01:52.36]Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
[01:54.37]Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine
[01:56.56]Reading for the chumps on the wall
[01:58.59]The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
[02:00.76]Gunshots rang out like a bell
[02:02.94]I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
[02:04.76]Falling on the concrete real fast
[02:07.03]Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
[02:09.08]Bumpet to bumper the avenue's packed
[02:11.10]I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
[02:13.11]Police on the scene you know what I mean
[02:15.18]They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends

[02:38.05]Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
[02:40.14]Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
[02:42.16]My town that created all the bass sound
[02:44.43]Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
[02:46.13]'Cause my style's like a chemical pill
[02:48.27]Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
[02:50.38]Conducted and formed
[02:51.46]This is a hell of a concept
[02:52.78]We make it hype and you want to step with this
[02:55.37]Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja
[02:57.66]Cut like a razor blade so fast other DJs say damn
[03:00.86]If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
[03:02.85]Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
[03:04.85]Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
[03:06.77]If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
