[00:00.02]Owl City
[00:00.03]
[00:00.04]If You're The Bird,
[00:03.78]Whenever we pretend it's summer,
[00:06.18]Then I'm the worm,
[00:09.43]I know the part, it's such a bummer,
[00:11.67]But fair is fair,
[00:15.33]If my segments get separated,
[00:17.73]I'll scream
[00:19.83]& you'll be there.
[00:22.15]
[00:23.64]Close your eyes (Close my eyes),
[00:26.90]So I cotton off of your shoulder,
[00:29.30]And feel the shine (feel the shine),
[00:32.33]I'm hooked so toss me over,
[00:34.83]And cast a line (oh I'll try),
[00:38.38]Oh throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends),
[00:42.85]As they arrive (if they arrive),
[00:45.29]
[00:47.04]You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind),
[00:52.71]But I still have just one more question on my mind,
[00:58.74]For all my pals who live in all the oceans and the seas,
[01:04.38]With friends like these well, who needs enemies?
[01:09.06]
[01:09.80]Da dat dah da da da da da da dat dah
[01:21.06]
[01:21.33]If I'm your boy,
[01:24.19]Let's take a short cut we remember,
[01:26.54]And we'll enjoy,
[01:30.01]Pickin' apples in late september
[01:32.24]Like we've done for years,
[01:35.40]Then we'll take a long walk through the corn field,
[01:38.35]And I'll kiss you, between the ears,
[01:42.56]
[01:43.90]If you're my girl,
[01:47.22]Swirl me around your room with feeling,
[01:49.69]And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling,
[01:55.67]Will shine for us,
[01:58.45]As love sweeps over the room,
[02:00.28]Cause we tend to make each other blush (you make me blush)
[02:05.93]
[02:08.07]You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind),
[02:13.18]But I still have just one more question on my mind,
[02:19.08]For all my pals who live in all the oceans and the seas,
[02:24.83]With fronds like these well, who needs anenomes?
[02:29.73]
[02:30.92]You're the bird and I'm the worm,
[02:33.48]And it's plain to see that we were meant to be
[02:52.20]We were meant to be
[02:53.72]
[02:54.04]Da dat dah da da da da da da dat dah
[03:03.63]We were meant to be
[03:03.79]If you're the bird
[03:07.47]If you're the bird
[03:10.21]Then I'm the worm
[03:15.43]We were meant to be
[03:17.73]
