[00:31.53]We are the lucky ones
[00:35.73]We shine like a thousand suns
[00:39.33]When all of the colour runs together
[00:46.71]
[00:47.70]I'll keep you company
[00:51.40]In one glorious harmony
[00:55.29]Waltzing with destiny forever
[01:02.85]
[01:03.56]Dance me into the night
[01:07.36]Underneath the full moon shining so bright
[01:15.45]Turning me into the light
[01:25.83]
[01:41.38]Time dancers whirling past
[01:45.28]I gaze through the looking glass
[01:49.46]And feel just beyond my grasp is heaven
[01:56.64]
[01:57.44]Sacred geometry
[02:01.44]Where movement is poetry
[02:05.33]Visions of you and me forever
[02:13.50]
[02:13.80]Dance me into the night
[02:17.59]Underneath the full moon shining so bright
[02:25.57]Turning me into the light
[02:36.35]
[02:52.00]Dance me into the night
[02:55.52]Underneath the full moon shining so bright
[03:03.11]Let the dark waltz begin
[03:06.78]Oh let me wheel - let me spin
[03:10.87]Let it take me again
[03:15.87]Turning me into the light
[03:30.24]
