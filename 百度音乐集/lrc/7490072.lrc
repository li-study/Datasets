[00:10.06]Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
[00:17.50]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[00:26.38]Remember me to one who lives there
[00:33.97]She once was a true love of mine
[00:40.59]
[00:43.82]Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
[00:48.27](Oh the sides of a hill in the deep forest green)
[00:51.10]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[00:55.50](Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown)
[01:00.09]Without no seams nor need work
[01:05.42](Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
[01:07.73]Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
[01:11.66](Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
[01:17.27]
[01:19.41]Tell her to find me on acre of land
[01:22.24](On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
[01:24.74]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[01:29.78](Washes the grave with silvery tears)
[01:35.93]Between the salt water and the sea strand
[01:39.05](A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
[01:41.12]Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
[01:46.57]
[01:50.84]Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
[01:57.63](War bellows blazing in scarlet battalion)
[01:58.64]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[02:02.97](Generals order their soldiers to kill)
[02:07.12]And gather it all in a bunch of heather
[02:10.31](And to fight for a cause they\'ve long ago forgotten)
[02:14.97]Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
[02:22.26]
[02:24.57]Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
[02:32.08]Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
[02:40.75]Remember me to one who lives there
[02:48.85]She once was a true love of mine
