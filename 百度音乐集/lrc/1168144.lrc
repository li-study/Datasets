[00:07:00]From Achtung Baby
[00:14:00]

[00:21.74]Sometimes I feel like I don't know
[00:25.95]Sometimes I feel like checkin' out
[00:32.00]I wanna get it wrong
[00:37.43]Can't always be strong
[00:41.56]And love it won't be long
[00:46.87]
[01:06.18]Oh sugar, don't you cry
[01:10.80]Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes
[01:14.86]You know I need you to be strong
[01:19.09]And the day is as dark as the night is long
[01:23.66]Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
[01:28.04]I'm in the black, can't see or be seen
[01:31.90]
[01:32.48]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[01:39.86]Alright now...
[01:40.99]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[01:48.03]
[01:51.01]You bury your treasure
[01:55.35]Where it can't be found
[01:59.80]But your love is like a secret
[02:03.83]That's been passed around
[02:08.40]There is a silence that comes to a house
[02:12.18]Where no one can sleep
[02:17.55]I guess it's the price of love
[02:20.94]I know it's not cheap
[02:23.40]
[02:24.45]Oh, come on...
[02:25.62]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[02:33.13]Oh, come on!

[02:52.33]Oooh...ultraviolet love...
[02:56.77]Oooh...ultraviolet love...
[03:00.99]
[03:01.59]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[03:07.41]
[03:16.43]I remember
[03:18.53]When we could sleep on stones
[03:24.65]Now we lie together
[03:27.93]In whispers and moans
[03:33.41]When I was all messed up
[03:36.35]And I had opera in my head
[03:42.34]Your love was a light bulb
[03:45.39]Hanging over my bed
[03:49.48]
[03:50.23]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[03:57.87]Oh, come on...
[03:59.19]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[04:06.51]

[04:12.58]Oooh...ultraviolet love...
[04:17.04]Oooh...ultraviolet love...
[04:21.40]Oooh...ultraviolet love...
[04:25.67]
[04:26.07]Baby, baby, baby...
[04:30.33]Baby, baby, baby...
[04:34.80]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[04:42.24]
[04:43.76]Baby, baby, baby...
[04:48.17]Baby, baby, baby...
[04:52.59]Baby, baby, baby...light my way
[04:59.88]
[05:01.57]Baby, baby, baby...
