[00:22.59]She walks around late at night
[00:25.92]In my old Allman Brothers t-shirt
[00:30.35]And not much else
[00:34.15]There's a hint of her perfume
[00:37.94]In the air, she lets her hair dry
[00:41.75]All by itself
[00:45.57]Then she shits down next to me and paints her toes
[00:49.44]And asks me why I'm staring
[00:53.57]
[00:54.50]She knows what she does to me
[01:00.34]All the little things set fire to my soul
[01:06.71]And i love that girl, and i go out of my way
[01:12.69]To find a way every day
[01:16.64]To make sure she knows
[01:21.67]
[01:22.84]I might call to say, "How's your day?"
[01:26.30]Or stop off at the Chevrom
[01:29.85]And buy a rose
[01:34.64]I might save a little cash from my check
[01:39.04]And get that dress
[01:41.76]She thought she'd have to sew
[01:46.81]I'll make her a card and scratch out words
[01:50.32]And still not get it right
[01:53.45]
[01:54.53]She knows what she does to me
[02:00.32]All the little things set fire to my soul
[02:06.66]And i love that girl, and i go out of my way
[02:12.78]To find a way every day
[02:16.59]To make sure she knows
[02:21.97]
[02:42.53]She knows what she does to me
[02:48.36]All the little things that set fire to my soul
[02:54.21]And I love that girl, and I go out of my way
[03:00.64]To find a way every day
[03:04.02]To make sure
[03:06.65]To make damn sure she knows
[03:12.99]
[03:19.01]Ooh...
