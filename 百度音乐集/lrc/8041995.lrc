[00:21.23]she's got a pretty smile
[00:25.32]it covers up the poison that she hides
[00:30.70]she walks around in circles in my head
[00:36.16]waiting for a chance to break me
[00:40.20]chance to take me down
[00:43.79]now I see this burden you gave me
[00:48.39]is too much to carry
[00:51.10]too much to bury inside
[01:02.77]that nobody changes
[01:07.57]I guess you're the only one
[01:10.77]left standing when everything else goes down
[01:19.15]you're still the only one,
[01:23.85]you're still the only one
[01:30.80]
[01:38.20]it's so shallow and all so appealing
[01:43.71]I'm up to my ankles and I'm drowning anyway
[01:48.51]in a sea of sarcastic faces
[01:52.29]familiar places
[01:54.58]everything looks quite the same here
[02:00.44]it's all confusingly amusing
[02:05.43]bitter and tainted the picture you painted to me
[02:13.62]I guess you're the only one
[02:19.43]that nobody changes
[02:24.50]I guess you're the only one
[02:28.46]left standing when everything else goes down
[02:35.34]you're still the only one
[02:40.27]who will never change faces
[02:46.30]I guess you're the only one
[02:49.58]left standing when everything else goes down
[03:02.58]
[03:39.03]just 'cause it's all in your head
[03:42.46]doesn't mean it has to be in mine
[03:44.99]don't believe what you said
[03:47.72]still can't get it out of my mind
[03:49.75]I've tried to find myself in approval
[03:55.16]I've already been there already done that
[04:01.00]it got me nowhere it brought me nothing
[04:05.78]but a good place to hide in
[04:08.41]no one to confide in now
[04:14.25]I guess you're the only one
[04:19.72]that nobody changes I guess
[04:25.22]guess you're the only one
[04:30.08]who will never change faces
[04:36.19]I guess you're the only one
[04:44.85]
[04:47.72]E
[04:48.58]N
[04:50.81]D
[04:53.81]I guess you're the only one
