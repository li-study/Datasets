[01:34.79]On you to
[01:35.36]Clear your view (yeah)
[01:35.81]When yo'al too crazy
[01:36.19]Lifeless for whose definition

[02:16.02]The essence, the basics
[02:17.37]Without it you make it
[02:18.74]Allow me to make
[02:19.96]This child like a nature
[02:21.78]Rhythm you have it
[02:22.88]Or you don't

[02:28.93]See with your eyes
[02:29.90]You see destruction and demise
[02:31.50]Corruption in the skies
[02:32.91]
[02:34.44]I'm sucked up to your lies
[02:35.72]With Russell not his muscles
[02:36.88]But precaution he provides
[02:38.96]For me I as a guide,
[02:40.40]Y'all can see me now
[02:41.29]'Cause you don't see
[02:42.31]With your eye
[02:42.97]You perceive with your mind
[02:44.23]That's the end of it
[02:45.26]So I'm gonna stick around
[02:47.50]With Russ and be a mentor
[02:48.29]

[02:52.97]I brought all this so you can
[02:54.71]Survive when
[02:55.62]Law is lawless (right here)
[02:57.06]Fearless, sensations that
[02:58.22]You thought was dead
[02:59.56]No squealing, remember that
[03:00.94]It's all in your head
[03:02.48]I ain't happy,
[03:02.87]I'm feeling glad
[03:03.91]I got sunshine in a bag
[03:06.78]I'm useless but
[03:08.62]Not for long
[03:09.67]The future is coming on
[03:12.42]I ain't happy,
[03:13.95]I'm feeling glad
[03:15.27]I got sunshine in a bag
