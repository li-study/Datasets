[00:36.15]Everyday I realize
[00:42.22]that this might be the last day of my life
[00:47.71]Walking down the street I find
[00:51.01]that I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind
[00:59.48]'Cause when it rains, it pours
[01:02.27]Isn't life worth more?
[01:04.97]I don't even know what I'm hustlin' for
[01:09.85]You've gotta do what you gotta do
[01:13.36]just to make it through
[01:16.05]All the hard times that's going to face you
[01:22.62]This is the life, trying to survive
[01:33.91]This is the life, trying to survive
[01:50.56]Living will always be a struggle
[01:55.35]looking for someone to love you
[02:01.04]Looking back at single horrors,
[02:07.20]this madness makes me want to hide
[02:12.49]Slowly, internally, I'm dying
[02:18.67]Pillow case is wet from all my crying
[02:24.06]There is nothing more for me to live for
[02:29.65]Take me away, I can't live that life no more
[02:35.94]This is the life, trying to survive
[02:47.31]This is the life, trying to survive
[02:58.68]This is the life, trying to survive
[03:09.86]This is the life, trying to survive
[03:18.23]This is the life, trying to survive
[03:42.28]This is the life, trying to survive
[03:39.99][03:45.66]I'm just trying to get over
[03:27.10][04:16.80]
