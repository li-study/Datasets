[00:00.10]John Mayer - Why Georgia
[00:05.30]
[00:10.68]I am driving up 85 in the
[00:15.41]Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
[00:23.50]just stuck inside the gloom
[00:30.09]4 more exits to my apartment but
[00:35.02]I am tempted to keep the car in drive
[00:43.15]And leave it all behind
[00:45.49]
[00:49.21]Cause I wonder sometimes
[00:56.31]About the outcome
[00:58.56]Of a still verdictless life
[01:05.47]
[01:06.78]Am I living it right?
[01:11.54]Am I living it right?
[01:16.48]Am I living it right?
[01:21.34]Why, why Georgia, why?
[01:27.56]
[01:36.73]I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
[01:41.56]Wood in places to make it feel like home
[01:49.85]But all I feel's alone
[01:54.01]It might be a quarter life crisis
[01:59.04]Or just the stirring in my soul
[02:02.66]
[02:05.05]Either way I wonder sometimes
[02:12.62]About the outcome
[02:15.08]Of a still verdictless life
[02:21.85]
[02:23.02]Am I living it right?
[02:28.04]Am I living it right?
[02:32.76]Am I living it right?
[02:37.74]Why, why Georgia, why?
[02:44.99]
[02:48.12]So what, so I've got a smile on
[02:53.39]But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
[02:58.64]Don't believe me
[03:03.38]Don't believe me
[03:07.19]When I say I've got it down
[03:13.61]
[03:22.98]Everybody is just a stranger but
[03:27.58]That's the danger in going my own way
[03:35.48]I guess it's the price I have to pay
[03:41.50]Still "everything happens for a reason"
[03:48.02]Is no reason not to ask myself
[03:53.54]If I am living it right
[03:59.27]Am I living it right?
[04:04]Am I living it right?
[04:08.99]Why, tell me why
[04:14.45]Why, why Georgia, why?
