[00:08.57]Oooh-oooh
[00:17.56]Everybody's got something
[00:19.86]They had to leave behind
[00:23.83]One regret from yesterday

[00:50.56]Till the day that I found you
[00:54.53]Even though I pretend that I've moved on
[00:59.37]You'll always be my baby
[01:02.62]I never found the words to say
[01:06.05]You're the one I think about each day
[01:10.10]And I know no matter where life takes me to
[01:14.75]A part of me will always be with you, yeah
