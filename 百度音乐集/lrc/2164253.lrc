[00:22.25]Every night i'm lyin' in bed
[00:27.56]Holdin' you close in my dreams
[00:32.47]Thinkin' about all the things that we said
[00:37.97]And comin' apart at the seams
[00:42.98]We try to talk it over
[00:48.51]But the words come out too rough
[00:53.55]I know you were tryin'
[00:56.37]To give me the best of your love
[01:02.03]
[01:04.81]Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
[01:10.19]Look at the way that we live
[01:15.32]Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
[01:20.81]Left us so little to give
[01:26.00]That same old crowd
[01:28.25]Was like a cold dark cloud
[01:31.38]That we could never rise above
[01:39.79]But here in my heart i give you the best of my love
[03:17.07][01:49.27]Oh sweet darlin', you get the best of my love,
[03:27.91][01:59.65]oh sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
[02:10.22]
[02:12.58]I'm goin' back in time
[02:15.85]And it's a sweet dream
[02:21.27]It was a quiet night
[02:23.61]And i would be all right
[02:26.24]If i could go on sleepin'
[02:32.69]But every mornin'
[02:35.19]I wake up and worry
[02:37.67]What's gonna happen today
[02:43.48]You see it your way
[02:45.56]And i see it mine
[02:47.97]But we both see it slippin' away
[02:52.22]
[02:54.31]You know we always had each other baby
[02:59.19]I guess that wasn't enough
[03:05.74]Oh, but here in my heart
[03:09.31]I give you the best of my love
[03:15.36]
[03:38.20]Oh, sweet darlin'
[03:42.73]Every night and day,
[03:44.69]You get the best of my love
[03:48.71]Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love
[03:58.56]Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love..
[04:10.46]Etc..
