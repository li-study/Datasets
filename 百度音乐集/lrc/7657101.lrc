[00:00.39]Where did we come from?
[00:02.96]Why are we here?
[00:05.83]Where do we go when we die?
[00:11.47]What lies beyond
[00:14.33]And what lay before?
[00:17.17]Is anything certain in life?
[00:22.71]They say, "Life is too short,"
[00:25.60]"The here and the now"
[00:28.80]And "You're only given one shot"
[00:34.14]But could there be more,
[00:36.96]Have I lived before,
[00:39.85]Or could this be all that we've got?
[00:45.58]If I die tomorrow
[00:49.69]I'd be allright
[00:52.47]Because I believe
[00:55.50]That after we're gone
[00:59.49]The spirit carries on
[01:24.98]I used to be frightened of dying
[01:30.68]I used to think death was the end
[01:36.33]But that was before
[01:38.90]I'm not scared anymore
[01:41.83]I know that my soul will transcend
[01:47.77]I may never find all the answers
[01:53.52]I may never understand why
[01:58.68]I may never prove
[02:01.23]What I know to be true
[02:03.88]But I know that I still have to try
[02:10.11]If I die tomorrow
[02:14.35]I'd be allright
[02:17.02]Because I believe
[02:19.93]That after we're gone
[02:24.26]The spirit carries on
[02:32.75]Move on, be brave
[02:35.41]Don't weep at my grave
[02:38.68]Because I am no longer here
[02:44.17]But please never let
[02:46.40]Your memory of me disappear"
[04:23.33]Safe in the light that surrounds me
[04:28.99]Free of the fear and the pain
[04:34.19]My questioning mind
[04:37.42]Has helped me to find
[04:40.38]The meaning in my life again
[04:45.99]Victoria's real
[04:48.75]I finally feel
[04:51.66]At peace with the girl in my dreams
[04:57.36]And now that I'm here
[05:00.20]It's perfectly clear
[05:02.86]I found out what all of this means
[05:08.60]If I die tomorrow
[05:12.90]I'd be allright
[05:15.61]Because I believe
[05:18.54]That after we're gone
[05:22.71]The spirit carries on
