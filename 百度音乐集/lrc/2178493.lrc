[00:02.00]Hands
[00:06.00]Music by Jewel Kilcher & Patrick Leonard
[00:08.00]If I could tell the world just one thing
[00:11.00]It would be that we're all OK
[00:14.00]And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
[00:18.00]And useless in times like these
[00:21.00]I won't be made useless
[00:26.00]I won't be idle with despair
[00:30.00]I will gather myself around my faith
[00:33.00]For light does the darkness most fear
[00:36.00]My hands are small, I know
[00:41.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[00:44.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[00:48.00]And I am never broken
[00:56.00]Poverty stole your golden shoes
[01:02.00]But it didn't steal your laughter
[01:05.00]And heartache came to visit me
[01:09.00]But I knew it wasn't ever after
[01:14.00]We'll fight, not out of spite
[01:17.00]For someone must stand up for what's right
[01:20.00]'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
[01:24.00]There ours shall go singing
[01:28.00]My hands are small I know
[01:32.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[01:36.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[01:39.00]And I am never broken
[01:44.00]In the end only kindness matters
[01:52.00]In the end only kindness matters
[02:01.00]I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
[02:09.00]I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
[02:16.00]I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
[02:23.00]My hands are small I know
[02:27.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[02:31.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[02:34.00]And I am never broken
[02:38.00]My hands are small I know
[02:42.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[02:46.00]But they're not yours, they are my own
[02:49.00]And I am never broken
[02:54.00]We are never broken
[03:14.00]We are God's eyes
[03:19.00]God's hands
[03:23.00]God's mind
[03:25.00]We are God's eyes
[03:30.00]God's hands
[03:34.00]God's heart
[03:37.00]We are God's eyes
[03:40.00]God's hands
[03:45.00]God's eyes
[03:47.00]We are God's hands
[03:49.00]We are God's hands
