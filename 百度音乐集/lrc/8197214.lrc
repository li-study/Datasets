[00:00.00]< I Can't Decide >
[00:00.20]
[00:00.60]By Scissor Sister
[00:00.80]
[00:01.19]It's not easy having yourself a good time
[00:07.67]Greasing up those bets and betters
[00:09.79]Watching out they don't four-letters
[00:12.18]Fuck and kiss you both at the same time
[00:17.10]Smells like something I've forgotten
[00:19.63]Curled up died and now it's rotton
[00:21.96]
[00:22.28]I'm not a ganster tonight
[00:25.04]Don't want to be a bad guy
[00:27.38]I'm just a loner, baby
[00:29.50]And now you've gotten in my way
[00:32.26]
[00:33.14]I can't decide
[00:34.89]Whether you should live or die
[00:37.05]Oh, you'll prob'ly go to heaven
[00:39.26]Please don't hang your head and cry
[00:41.93]No wonder why
[00:43.12]My heart feels dead inside
[00:45.01]It's cold and hard and petrified
[00:47.54]Lock the doors and close the blinds
[00:49.79]We're going for a ride
[00:55.68]
[00:56.81]It's a bitch convincing people to like you
[01:02.54]If I stop now call me a quitter
[01:05.00]If lies were cats you'd be litter
[01:07.53]Please everyone isn't like you
[01:12.40]Dancing jigs until I'm crippled
[01:14.93]Slug ten drinks I won't get pickled
[01:17.32]
[01:17.56]I've got to hand it to you
[01:19.99]You've played by all the same rules
[01:22.62]It's takes the truth to fool me
[01:25.28]And now you've made me angry
[01:27.03]
[01:27.76]I can't decide
[01:29.42]Whether you should live or die
[01:31.85]Oh, you'll prob'ly go to heaven
[01:34.43]Please don't hang your head and cry
[01:36.82]No wonder why
[01:38.16]My heart feels dead inside
[01:39.86]It's cold and hard and petrified
[01:42.34]Lock the doors and close the blinds
[01:44.74]We're going for a ride
[01:46.81]
[01:47.59]Oh, I could throw you in a lake
[01:49.80]Or feed you poisoned birthday cake
[01:52.37]I won't deny I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
[01:57.52]Oh, I could bury you alive
[01:59.64]But you might crawl out with a knife
[02:02.06]And kill me when I'm sleeping
[02:03.70]
[02:04.08]That's why
[02:04.80]
[02:05.03]I can't decide
[02:06.92]Whether you should live or die
[02:09.27]Oh, you'll prob'ly go to heaven
[02:11.57]Please don't hang your head and cry
[02:14.37]No wonder why
[02:15.29]My heart feels dead inside
[02:17.23]It's cold and hard and petrified
[02:19.53]Lock the doors and close the blinds
[02:21.83]We're going for a ride
