[00:05.16]If it wasn't the oceans,
[00:08.25]wasn't the breezes,
[00:10.80]wasn't the white sands,
[00:13.05]I might not be needed,
[00:15.00]If I could sleep through the coal mines,
[00:17.60]If I could breathe through hatred,
[00:21.21]If I could, work through the summer,
[00:23.31]then I woulnd't feel so humble,
[00:24.98]oh you, it's always you,
[00:29.54]it's always you.
[00:31.41]
[00:34.56]If red roses weren't so lovely,
[00:37.18]Wine didn't taste so good,
[00:39.89]Stars weren't so romantic,
[00:41.89]Then I could do what I should
[00:44.64]Oh you, it's always you
[00:49.19]It's always you.
[00:50.94]
[00:54.35]Oh you, it's always you
[00:58.97]It's always you
[01:01.00]
[01:04.25]If you love, I could command it,
[01:09.09]Get your head, to understand it,
[01:14.00]I'd go twice, around the world,
[01:18.95]Even though, I may not find it.
[01:24.02]Oh you, it's always you,
[01:28.48]It's always you.
[01:33.75]Oh You, it's always you,
[01:38.27]It's always you.
[01:40.11]
[02:03.07]Oh you, it's always you,
[02:07.72]It's always you.
[02:12.78]Oh You, it's always you,
[02:17.35]It's always you.
