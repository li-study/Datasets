
[00:54.71]The Final Countdown
[01:05.57]Europe
[01:22.41]
[04:41.65][01:27.30]We're leaving together,
[01:31.35]But still it's farewell
[01:35.48]And maybe we'll come back,
[01:39.68]To earth, who can tell?
[01:43.70]I guess there is no one to blame
[01:47.84]We're leaving ground
[01:51.90]Will things ever be the same again?
[01:57.66]It's the final countdown...
[02:03.03]
[02:16.39]We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
[02:24.31]Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
[02:32.68]With so many light years to go and things to be found
[02:41.43]I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.
[04:53.76][04:45.83][04:37.09][04:29.36][02:46.76]It's the final countdown...
[04:59.69][04:35.63][04:24.80]
