[00:01.93]I saw her mother this morning
[00:07.93]At the downtown cafe
[00:11.15]Staring blankly Down in mourning
[00:16.68]Had her cup of gourmet coffee
[00:19.93]And she asked me What her baby'd been missing
[00:25.34]And I shake my head
[00:28.69]Can't think of nothing
[00:30.78]But candy wrappers
[00:33.50]Tucked into the folds of the bed
[00:37.94]And how I don't see them around
[00:42.76]Since Sarah left town
[01:03.03]Now people always think they know you
[01:08.47]And they're almost always wrong
[01:11.84]Tried to bend you till they broke you
[01:17.68]So she moved along
[01:21.56]And sometimes I see them around
[01:26.31]Since Sarah left town
[01:30.58]Trying to track her down
[01:35.11]
[01:37.89]Sarah, Sarah
[01:46.65]Sarah, Sarah
[02:04.14]She's chasing her soul
[02:08.41]Not running away
[02:12.87]If you'd just let her go
[02:17.40]She'll know the way
[02:20.43]And I saw her mother this morning
[02:27.01]She looked me in the eye
[02:30.50]She said: “Dyou know sometimes,
[02:32.47]I think I hear her laughing
[02:35.66]And all I can do is cry”
[02:39.63]And it's a funny thing about people
[02:44.45]How everyone has a song
[02:48.22]And he sings it every moment
[02:52.66]But we don't hear it until he's gone
[02:57.61]And sometimes I see them around
[03:02.41]Since Sarah left town
[03:05.85]They're humming with heads hanging down
[03:11.00]
[03:14.31]嗯……
[03:23.01]嗯……
[03:31.28]Sarah, Sarah
[03:40.03]Sarah, Sarah
