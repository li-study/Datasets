[03:46.68][00:21.55]Enya: Marble Halls
[00:23.46]I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
[00:31.03]with vassals and serfs at my side,
[00:39.45]and of all who assembled within those walls
[00:47.97]that I was the hope and the pride.
[00:56.34]I had riches all too great to count
[01:04.40]and a high ancestral name.
[01:12.11]But I also dreamt which pleased me most
[01:22.08]that you loved me still the same,
[01:27.63]that you loved me
[01:29.70]you loved me still the same,
[01:34.89]that you loved me
[01:37.65]you loved me still the same.
[02:04.10]I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
[02:11.40]that knights upon bended knee
[02:19.89]and with vows no maidens heart could withstand,
[02:27.86]they pledged their faith to me.
[02:36.26]And I dreamt that one of that noble host
[02:44.25]came forth my hand to claim.
[02:51.98]But I also dreamt which charmed me most
[03:01.64]that you loved me still the same
[03:07.24]that you loved me
[03:09.75]you loved me still the same,
[03:14.70]that you loved me
[03:17.54]you loved me still the same.
