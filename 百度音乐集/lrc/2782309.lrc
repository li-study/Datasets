[00:16.82]I guess our song is over
[00:20.69]We played our last goodbye
[00:24.29]I’m longing for your sweet love baby
[00:27.77]To help me through the night
[00:32.02]I thought I had it all
[00:35.63]I used to feel alive
[00:39.41]But I took you for granted
[00:42.13]Now you’re cold inside
[00:44.60]Where do you go
[00:48.40]When you’re all alone?
[00:52.08]Where do you run
[00:55.79]When your heart turns to stone?
[00:59.18]Now where is my light?
[01:02.68]Now all is said and done for me
[01:06.45]Please baby stay
[01:13.85]Please baby stay
[01:17.79]I guess our picture’s fading
[01:21.87]But I remember it well
[01:25.88]The way you used to thrill me, baby
[01:29.06]You loved like no one else
[01:33.18]It’s a crying shame
[01:36.97]I didn’t treat you right
[01:40.67]If I could turn the tide now, baby
[01:44.14]You’d be here tonight…
[01:45.92]Where do you go
[01:49.61]When you’re all alone?
