[00:05.89]Green Day
[00:07.89]
[00:42.55]Born into Nixon I was raised in hell
[00:46.69]A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
[00:50.69]The last one born the first one to run
[00:54.81]My town was blind from refinery sun
[00:58.24]
[00:59.25]My generation is zero
[01:03.40]I never made it as a working class hero
[01:07.21]
[01:07.44]21st century breakdown
[01:11.21]I once was lost but never was found
[01:15.36]I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
[01:19.16]To the 20th century deadline
[01:23.33]
[01:32.68]I was made of poison and blood
[01:36.92]Combination is what I understood
[01:40.87]Videogames to the tower's fall
[01:44.99]Homeland security could kill us all
[01:48.42]
[01:49.21]My generation is zero
[01:53.34]I never made it as a working class hero
[01:57.31]
[01:57.52]21st century breakdown
[02:01.14]I once was lost but never was found
[02:05.26]I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
[02:09.12]To the 20th century deadline
[02:15.25]
[02:37.69]We are the cries of the class of '13
[02:40.82]Born in the year of humility
[02:43.91]We are the desperate in the decline
[02:47.04]Raised by the bastards of 1969
[02:52.30]
[03:01.46]My name is 'No one'
[03:03.10]The long lost son
[03:04.31]Born on the 4th of July
[03:07.34]Raised in the barnyards of heroes and cons
[03:10.20]That left me for dead or alive
[03:12.75]
[03:13.31]I am a nation
[03:14.56]A worker of pride
[03:16.16]My debt to the status quo
[03:19.12]The scars on my hands
[03:20.51]And a means to an end
[03:22.03]It's all that I have to show
[03:24.87]
[03:36.91]I swallowed my pride
[03:38.27]And I choked on my faith
[03:39.79]I've given my heart and my soul
[03:42.78]And lied through my teeth
[03:44.16]The pillar of damage control
[03:48.41]
[03:48.80]I've been to the edge
[03:50.12]And I've thrown the bouquet
[03:51.73]Of flowers left over the grave
[03:54.63]I sat in the waiting room
[03:56.29]Wasting my time
[03:57.56]And waiting for judgement day
[04:00.48]
[04:01.50]I praise liberty
[04:03.76]The  Freedom to obey
[04:06.53]It's a song that strangles me,
[04:09.33]Don't cross the line
[04:12.45]
[04:38.82]Oh, dream, American dream
[04:44.78]I can't even sleep
[04:48.57]From the light's early dawn
[04:52.33]
[04:54.22]Oh, bleed, America bleed
[05:00.16]Believe what you read
[05:03.97]From heroes and cons
[05:08.00]
