[00:07.00]Judas Priest
[00:14.00]
[00:17.86]I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
[00:23.75]But that's not unusual
[00:27.41]It's just that the moon is full
[00:30.90]And you decided to call
[00:33.59]
[00:35.57]And here I sit, hand on the telephone
[00:42.02]Hearing the voice I'd known
[00:45.55]A couple of light years ago
[00:48.85]Headed straight for a fall
[00:51.47]
[00:53.34]But we both know what memories can bring
[00:55.74]They bring diamonds and rust
[01:00.33]Yes we both know what memories can bring
[01:02.67]They bring diamonds and rust
[01:06.10]
[01:07.46]Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
[01:14.69]Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
[01:22.52]Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
[01:29.81]Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there
[01:41.18]
[01:55.22]Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
[02:01.48]Then give me another word for it
[02:05.55]You were so good with words
[02:08.60]And at keeping things vague
[02:11.62]
[02:13.02]Cause I need some of that vagueness now
[02:15.88]It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
[02:22.85]And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid
[02:29.33]
[02:30.98]But we both know what memories can bring
[02:33.44]They bring diamonds and rust
[02:37.99]Yes we both know what memories can bring
[02:40.02]They bring diamonds and rust
[02:44.43]
[02:45.49]Diamonds, diamonds and rust
[03:18.51]
