[00:02.00]
[00:18.32]I remember the day when we first got close
[00:22.29]It was out on the beach under the warm sun
[00:26.64]Just breathing the air there was never a care
[00:30.59]Wishing our dreams could be a reality
[00:33.81]
[00:34.21]Now I notice when you touch me it don't feel the same no more
[00:38.35]I feel the cold of winter in your hands
[00:42.52]How I wish that I could say it
[00:44.64]But I don't wanna fall apart
[00:46.86]I wish that you could see the true reality
[00:50.94]
[00:52.32]I'm over your eyes
[00:54.45]I'm over your touch
[00:56.42]And I'm over the promises that you've broken
[01:00.76]When you call me at night
[01:02.76]With the sound in your voice
[01:04.96]And undo the reasons I had for leaving
[01:09.24]When I'm out of "I love you"s and I'm out of "Goodbye"s
[01:13.51]You know how to hold me and dry my eyes
[01:17.77]What should I do with a love like you?
[01:31.11]
[01:34.08]So I keep holding on the best that I can
[01:38.84]I'm hoping you'll see the situation
[01:43.16]But I don't know how long I can handle the pain
[01:46.94]I think it's time to face reality
[01:49.65]
[01:50.71]Cause I notice when you touch me it don't feel the same no more
[01:54.44]I felt the cold of winter in your hands
[01:58.98]I try to say the words but I can't get to the core
[02:03.30]And I wish you could see the true reality
[02:07.88]
[02:08.66]I'm over your eyes
[02:10.79]I'm over your touch
[02:12.88]And I'm over the promises that you've broken
[02:17.12]When you call me at night
[02:19.23]With the sound in your voice
[02:21.43]And undo the reasons I had for leaving
[02:25.58]When I'm out of "I love you"s and I'm out of "Goodbye"s
[02:29.83]You know how to hold me and dry my eyes
[02:34.24]What should I do with a love like you? (love like you)
[02:45.23]
[02:45.72]First it hurts then it don't
[02:47.66]Though my heart says it won't
[02:50.04]With a love like you
[02:53.98]Boy it's wrong when it's right
[02:56.00]I'm stuck in this fight
[02:58.34]With myself over you
[03:05.40]What am I supposed to do?
[03:12.49]
[03:23.16]I'm over your eyes
[03:25.13]I'm over your touch
[03:27.24]And I'm over the promises that you've broken
[03:31.66](When you call me at night)
[03:33.44]With the sound in your voice
[03:35.74]And undo the reasons I had for leaving
[03:39.91]When I'm out of "I love you"s and I'm out of "Goodbye"s
[03:44.20]You know how to hold me and dry my eyes
[03:48.87]What should I do with a love like you?
