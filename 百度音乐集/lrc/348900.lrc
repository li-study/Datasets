[00:16.98]I\'m dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:25.34]Just like the ones I used to know
[00:31.51]Where the treetops glisten
[00:36.09]And children listen
[00:40.16]To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[00:48.05]I\'m dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:56.55]With every Christmas card around
[01:02.55]May your days be merry and bright
[01:10.46]And may all your Christmases be white
[01:53.98]I\'m dreaming of a white Christmas
[02:02.21]Just like the ones I used to know
[02:08.76]Where the treetops glisten
[02:13.02]And children listen
[02:16.95]To hear sleigh bells in the snow
[02:24.95]I\'m dreaming of a white Christmas
[02:33.14]With every Christmas card around
[02:39.82]May your days be merry and bright
[02:47.32]And may all your Christmases be white
[02:54.80]May your days be merry and bright
[03:04.87]And may all your Christmases be white
[03:21.87]your Christmases be white
