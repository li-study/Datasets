[00:09.15]Hey excuse me
[00:13.04]Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
[00:15.21]I make forty-some dollars a day
[00:18.35]I used to be the man in my hometown
[00:20.76]'til I started to lose my way
[00:24.09]It all goes back to when I dropped out at school
[00:26.58]Having fun, I was living the life
[00:29.68]But now I got a problem with that little white rock
[00:32.30]See I can put down the pipe
[00:35.40]And it is breaking me down
[00:38.47]Watching the world spin round
[00:41.54]While my dreams fall down
[00:44.68]Is anybody out there?
[00:46.32]
[00:47.50]It is breaking me down
[00:50.00]No more friends around...
[00:52.68]And my dreams fall down...
[00:55.70]Is anybody out there?
[00:57.17]
[00:58.06]Can anybody out there hear me?
[01:00.55]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[01:03.48]Can anybody out there see me?
[01:06.08]'Cause I can't seem to see myself...
[01:09.17]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[01:11.82]Can you save me from this hell?
[01:15.12]Can anybody out there feel me?
[01:18.50]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
[01:19.91]
[01:20.61]Losing my way
[01:22.62]Keep losing my way...
[01:25.61]Keep losing my way...
[01:27.78]Can you help me find my way?
[01:31.60]Losing my way
[01:33.96]Keep losing my way
[01:36.44]Keep losing my way...
[01:39.32]Can you help me find my way?
[01:41.31]
[01:43.35]Now you gotta understand I was a family man
[01:45.67]I would have gave anything for my own
[01:48.81]But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
[01:51.70]So I ended up all alone
[01:54.43]I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
[01:57.12]See I thought I was living the life
[02:00.11]And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes
[02:05.12]
[02:05.80]And it is breaking me down
[02:09.04]Watching the world spin round
[02:11.94]While my dreams fall down
[02:15.40]Is anybody out there?
[02:16.75]
[02:18.04]It is breaking me down
[02:20.47]No more friends around...
[02:23.08]And my dreams fall down...
[02:25.86]Is anybody out there?
[02:27.87]
[02:28.30]Can anybody out there hear me?
[02:30.84]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[02:34.07]Can anybody out there see me?
[02:36.49]'Cause I can't see to see myself
[02:39.72]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[02:42.76]Can you save me from this hell?
[02:45.35]Can anybody out there feel me?
[02:47.86]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself.

[03:13.84]
[03:14.78]Oh my god please forgive me (father hear my pray)
[03:19.41]'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
[03:25.12]If I could do it all again
[03:27.96]Have just one more chance
[03:30.84]To take all those wrongs and make them right
[03:35.23]
[03:36.45]Can anybody out there hear me?
[03:38.66]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[03:42.14]Can anybody out there see me?
