[00:00.00]Sarah Brightman - Until The End Of Time
[01:00.04]
[01:04.04]Around the world in eighty days
[01:07.37]We sailed the seven seas
[01:10.92]A thousand nights and one
[01:13.55]And forty more in fantasy
[01:17.78]The prophecy in destiny was falling
[01:23.10]Calling
[01:24.93]Falling
[01:26.45]And calling out to me
[01:29.43]And will we find our destination
[01:36.11]Within a time of resignation
[01:43.04]A night of poetry and motion
[01:48.66]At 69, until the end of time
[02:00.32]
[02:27.04]If I were God and ruled the world
[02:30.47]I'd spin a wheel of dreams
[02:33.89]Of waking as in paradise
[02:37.32]And shadows in between
[02:40.84]The prophecy in destiny was falling
[02:46.17]Calling
[02:47.94]Falling
[02:49.49]And calling out to me
[02:52.67]And will we find our destination
[02:59.10]Within a time of resignation
[03:05.98]A night of poetry and motion
[03:11.79]At 69, until the end of time
[03:20.10]Was there in a moment in the madness
[03:26.83]And then a momentary sadness
[03:33.79]A night of poetry and motion
[03:39.17]All at 69, until the end of time
[03:54.35]
[04:15.60]Until the end of time
[04:21.77]
