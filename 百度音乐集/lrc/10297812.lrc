[00:17.24]Stuck on you
[00:20.25]I've got this feeling down
[00:23.35]Deep in my soul
[00:24.05]That I just can't lose
[00:26.82]Guess, I'm on my way
[00:31.49]Needed a friend
[00:35.57]And the way I feel now I guess
[00:38.55]I'll be with you till the end
[00:41.83]Guess I'm on my way
[00:45.74]Mighty glad you stayed
[01:02.26]I'm stuck on you
[01:05.08]Been a fool too long I guess
[01:07.03]It's time for me to come on home
[01:10.66]Guess I'm on my way
[01:16.84]So hard to see
[01:19.60]That a woman like you could wait
[01:22.42]Around for a man like me
[01:25.28]Guess I'm on my way
[01:29.75]Mighty glad you stayed
[01:43.10]Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tommorrow
[01:51.07]And I know just where I'm going
[01:59.18]I've packed up my troubles
[02:03.80]And I've thrown them all away
[02:08.74]Because this time little darlin'
[02:14.77]I'm coming home to stay
[02:20.57]I'm stuck on you
[02:23.66]I've got this feeling down
[02:26.07]Deep in my soul
[02:27.77]That I just can't lose
[02:30.04]Guess, I'm on my way
[02:36.83]Needed a friend
[02:39.09]And the way I feel now I guess
[02:41.11]I'll be with you till the end
[02:43.98]Guess I'm on my way
[02:49.00]I'm mighty glad you stayed
