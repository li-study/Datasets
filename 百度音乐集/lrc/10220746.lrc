[00:05.70]
[00:11.25]I didn’t want to know
[00:18.02]I just didn’t want to know
[00:23.04]Best to keep things in the shallow end
[00:27.37]Cause I never quite learned how to swim
[00:32.78]I just didn’t want to know
[00:34.76]Didn’t want， didn’t want
[00:50.27]Close my eyes just to look at you
[00:55.28]Taken by the seamless vision
[00:59.73]I close my eyes
[01:03.20]Ignore the smoke
[01:05.87]Ignore the smoke，Ignore the smoke
[01:10.37]
[01:10.90]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[01:16.61]Such a lovely color for you
[01:22.20]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[01:27.27]While I just sit and stare at you
[01:34.45]
[01:41.63]Because I don’t want to know
[01:45.29]
[01:52.45]I didn’t want to know
[01:57.58]I just didn’t want to know
[02:02.68]I just didn’t want
[02:04.80]Mistook their nods for an approval
[02:09.60]Just ignore the smoke and smile
[02:14.73]
[02:16.34]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[02:21.38]Such a lovely color for you
[02:26.66]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[02:31.97]Such a perfect color for your eyes
[02:37.80]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[02:42.87]Such a lovely color for you
[02:48.63]Call it aftermath， she’s turning blue
[02:53.50]While I just sit and stare at you
[02:59.74]
[04:00.75]The End
[04:05.35]Thank You
