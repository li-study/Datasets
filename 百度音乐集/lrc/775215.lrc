[03:46.80][03:26.35][03:08.35][02:51.23][02:33.20][02:23.63][02:07.41][01:48.62][01:34.70][01:09.72][00:50.46][00:50.00][00:37.20][00:08.22]
[00:20.46]No one ever said that
[00:22.05]Love was gonna be easy
[00:24.66]Gotta take the ups and downs
[00:26.27]The in-betweens
[00:29.03]If you take this journey
[00:30.30]Gotta give yourself completely
[00:32.52]Never let nobody ever step on a dream
[02:41.35][02:38.70][01:39.14][01:35.24][00:41.40][00:37.55]You better stop
[02:39.70][00:38.78]Listen to these words that I say
[02:43.05][00:42.47]Don't you throw this good thing away
[00:45.65]No, no
[02:46.47][00:46.37]Put your trust in me
[02:48.45][00:48.27]And I'll make you see
[03:09.32][02:51.79][01:49.46][00:51.24]No the rain won't last forever
[03:11.94][02:53.36][01:51.14][00:53.39]Find a way to make it better
[03:14.16][03:04.45][02:55.48][01:53.16][00:55.58]Long as we can stand together
[03:16.27][02:57.60][01:55.26][00:57.69]Love will find a way
[03:18.70][02:59.81][01:57.74][01:00.12]Gonna make a new tomorrow
[03:20.68][03:02.04][01:59.78][01:02.21]Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
[03:22.93][03:04.23][02:02.02][01:04.36]Better listen when I say
[03:24.96][03:06.30][02:03.95][01:06.44]'Love will find a way'
[01:17.94]Somebody tried to tell me love
[01:20.19]Don't last forever
[01:22.17]Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
[01:26.49]After all is said and done
[01:28.68]We're still here together
[01:30.96]Never listen to the lies and jealousy
[01:36.53]Don't you let them turn you around
[01:40.89]Hang onto this love that we've found
[01:44.01]Nothing ever say
[01:46.20]Can stand in our way
[03:36.89][03:26.97][02:23.93][02:15.10]I want you
[03:37.83][03:28.89][02:24.86][02:16.10]I need you
[03:39.53][03:29.95][02:26.40][02:17.13]You know that I believe you
[03:41.35][03:32.22][02:27.95][02:19.40]We got it
[03:42.32][03:33.13][02:29.14][02:20.36]You know it
[03:43.46][03:34.29][02:30.33][02:21.98]So if it's true
[02:31.52][02:22.64]You'll show it
[02:45.85]No...
[03:44.80][03:36.22]You'll show it...
