[00:08.70]The Cure Pictures Of You(long version)
[00:21.96]编辑 niranaioro 将Pop推入无底深渊
[01:53.01]I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
[01:58.19]That I almost believe that they're real
[02:03.66]I've been living so long with my pictures of you
[02:09.08]That I almost believe that the pictures are
[02:14.08]All I can feel
[02:20.51]
[02:36.97]Remembering You standing quiet in the rain
[02:42.90]As I ran to your heart to be near
[02:48.81]And we kissed as the sky fell in
[02:52.30]Holding you close
[02:54.43]How I always held close in your fear
[03:00.66]Remembering
[03:01.22]You running soft through the night
[03:05.95]You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
[03:11.61]And screamed at the make-believe
[03:14.38]Screamed at the sky
[03:16.93]And you finally found all your courage
[03:21.84]To let it all go
[03:38.98]
[03:44.97]Remembering
[03:46.60]You fallen into my arms
[03:50.77]Crying for the death of your heart
[03:56.12]You were stone white
[03:58.12]So delicate
[03:59.06]Lost in the cold
[04:01.42]You were always so lost in the dark
[04:07.02]Remembering
[04:07.97]You how you used to be
[04:12.71]Slow drowned
[04:13.85]You were angels
[04:15.42]So much more than everything
[04:18.40]Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
[04:23.94]Open my eyes
[04:26.13]But I never see anything
[04:29.74]
[04:30.92]If only I'd thought of the right words
[04:34.84]I could have held on to your heart
[04:40.34]If only I'd thought of the right words
[04:45.63]I wouldn't be breaking apart
[04:50.11]All my pictures of you
[04:53.53]
[05:14.00]Looking so long at these pictures of you
[05:19.19]But I never hold on to your heart
[05:25.04]Looking so long for the words to be true
[05:30.39]But always just breaking apart
[05:34.56]My pictures of you
[05:38.62]
[06:20.32]There was nothing in the world
[06:22.81]That I ever wanted more
[06:26.11]Than to feel you deep in my heart
[06:31.21]There was nothing in the world
[06:33.88]That I ever wanted more
[06:37.06]Than to never feel the breaking apart
[06:41.29]All my pictures of you
[06:45.39]
