[00:13.00]I feel like I've been locked up tight
[00:16.00]For a century of lonely nights
[00:19.00]Waiting for someone to release me
[00:24.00]You're licking your lips
[00:26.00]And blowing kisses my way
[00:27.00]But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
[00:29.00]Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)
[00:35.00]Ooooh
[00:39.00]My body's saying lets go
[00:41.00]Ooooh
[00:45.00]But my heart is saying no
[00:47.00]If you wanna be with me
[00:49.00]Baby there's a price to pay
[00:53.00]I'm a genie in a bottle
[00:55.00]You gotta rub me the right way
[00:58.00]If you wanna be with me
[01:01.00]I can make your wish come true
[01:04.00]You gotta make a big impression
[01:06.00]I gotta like what you do
[01:08.00]I'm a genie in a bottle baby
[01:12.00]Gotta rub me the right way honey
[01:14.00]I'm a genie in a bottle baby
[01:17.00]Come, come, come on and let me out
[01:19.00]The music's playing
[01:20.00]The light's down low
[01:22.00]Just one more dance
[01:23.00]And then we're good to go
[01:24.00]Waiting for someone
[01:27.00]Who needs me
[01:30.00]Hormones racing at the speed of light
[01:32.00]But that don't mean its gotta be tonight
[01:35.00]Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)
[01:41.00]Ooooh
[01:45.00]My body's saying lets go
[01:46.00]Ooooh

[01:52.00]If you wanna be with me
[01:55.00]Baby there's a price to pay
[01:58.00]I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
