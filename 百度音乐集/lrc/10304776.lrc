[00:15.72]I'm going underground
[00:21.73]強い風が 吹き抜ける 白い光の中で
[00:31.94]立ち止まって 寄りかかれるのは
[00:40.30]冷たいタイルの壁だけ
[00:47.30]読みもしない雑誌を広げた
[00:53.88](I'm never gonna cry)
[00:55.63]突然こぼれてしまう 涙を隠せるように
[01:03.02]Please... Don't say her name
[01:05.02]I don't wanna hear about her
[01:07.06]Don't say her name
[01:08.67]心の中 いつもつぶやくけど 伝わらないの!
[01:18.39]I want you to say she's just a friend, Baby
[01:22.21]I hate you when you're talking about her

[02:22.22]困らせてしまうことで 気まずくなりたくない
[02:29.44]Please... Don't say her name
[02:31.31]I don't wanna hear about her
[02:34.02]Don't say her name
[02:35.31]平気な振りするのって 居心地がとても悪いわ
[02:45.10]I want you to say she's just a friend, Baby
[02:48.79]I hate you when you're talking about her
[02:52.92]Please... Don't say her name
[02:54.83]笑えるほど傷ついてしまうの
[03:04.14]
[03:32.90]Boy, I don't wanna hear about her from you
[03:40.65]
[03:55.84]Hey Baby Please... Don't say her name
[03:57.95]I don't wanna hear about her
