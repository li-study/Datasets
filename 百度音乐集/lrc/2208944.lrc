[00:08.84]Sunshine
[00:12.73]Sometimes it's hard，When rain's pouring on
[00:15.20]I used to worry
[00:22.55]What tommorrow would bring
[00:25.53]Then you came along
[00:28.76]Gave me something to believe in
[00:34.29]When I'm upside down
[00:40.58]And let me say I owe it all to you
[00:46.58]And I wanna thank you
[00:52.47]For making the sun come
[00:58.89]Shining through
[01:12.80]Now that we're together
[01:17.10]Everything can only get better (get better and better)
[01:23.57]Now that you're around me
[01:28.64]Swear I'm gonna love you forever (forever and ever)
[01:31.12]Now that we're together
[01:37.20]Everything can only get better
[01:38.90]You bring the sunshine to my life
[01:42.11]If you should find
[01:50.02]You need someone too
[01:57.63]Just turn head in my direction
[02:03.78]And I'll do the same to you
[02:09.22]And let me say from the bottom of my heart
[02:15.49]I wanna thank you (I wanna thank you)
[02:21.99]For making the sun come shining through
[02:29.17]Now that we're together
[02:34.10]Everything can only get better (get better and better)。。。
