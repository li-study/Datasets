[00:18.27]PHANTOM PLANET-"Wishing Well"
[00:23.89]
[00:31.12]It cursed us all on our way home
[00:37.63]We passed the sights like passing stones
[00:42.70]And I will never go back there again
[00:46.88]The tourists and the army men
[00:50.65]The prostitutes this evening
[00:54.19]Will start to sink under my skin
[00:57.45]The dust and sand is what they sell
[01:00.98]The flashing lights and ringing bells
[01:04.53]A wish as far as I can tell
[01:07.86]Inside this dried up wishing well
[01:13.43]
[01:21.36]He is the shrieks I am the fear
[01:27.70]That yelling man rings in my ears
[01:34.29]Out of his mind he's my conscience
[01:41.32]Hour after hour pill after pill
[01:48.14]He is my bellyache I've taken so much medicine to kill
[01:55.08]I know there's something wrong
[01:57.80]'Cause this night just drags on and on
[02:00.92]The clock still says it won't be long
[02:04.43]'Til all your hard earned money's gone
[02:07.96]The dust and sand is what they sell
[02:11.34]The flashing lights and ringing bells
[02:14.82]A wish as far as I can tell
[02:18.24]Inside this dried up wishing well
[02:26.92]
[02:41.72]And I will never go back there again
[02:45.36]The tourists and the army men
[02:48.85]The prostitutes this evening
[02:52.38]Will start to sink under my skin
[02:55.69]The dust and sand is what they sell
[02:58.99]The flashing lights and ringing bells
[03:02.57]A wish as far as I can tell
[03:06.03]Inside this dried up wishing well
