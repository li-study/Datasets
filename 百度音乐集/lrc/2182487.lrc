[00:03.00]Kelly Clarkson 
[00:07.00]
[00:08.10]Tear up the photographs 
[00:10.43]But yesterday won’t let go 
[00:14.12]Every day every day every minute 
[00:17.52]Here comes the emptiness 
[00:19.93]Just can’t be lonely you know 
[00:23.34]Every day every day hey hey 
[00:27.43]This second-chancin’s really getting me down 
[00:32.02]You give and takin’ everything I dreamed about 
[00:37.50]It’s time you let me know let me know just let go 
[00:43.62]
[00:43.90]All I ever wanted 
[00:45.73]all I ever wanted 
[00:47.86]was a simple way to get over you 
[00:53.03]all I ever wanted 
[00:55.30]all I ever wanted 
[00:57.45]was an in-between to escape this desperate scene 
[01:03.87]where every law reveals the truth 
[01:08.77]baby cause I all ever wanted 
[01:12.20]all I ever wanted was you 
[01:16.34]
[01:17.91]I’d rather walk alone 
[01:19.95]Don’t wanna chase you around 
[01:23.73]Every day every day every minute 
[01:27.21]I thought a thousand times 
[01:29.53]For I let you drag me down 
[01:33.11]Every day every day hey hey 
[01:36.88]Your new beginning was a perfect ending 
[01:41.47]But I keep feeling we’ve already been here before 
[01:47.06]It’s time you let me know let me know just let go 
[01:53.02]
[01:53.19]All I ever wanted 
[01:55.23]all I ever wanted 
[01:57.40]was a simple way to get over you

[02:04.80]all I ever wanted 
[02:06.96]was an in-between to escape this desperate scene 
[02:13.54]where every law reveals the truth 
[02:18.30]baby cause I all ever wanted 
[02:21.62]all I ever wanted was you 
[02:25.51]
[02:26.04]Tell me with so many out there 
[02:28.96]Why I always turn to you 
[02:34.34]Your goodbyes tear me down every time 
[02:38.17]And it’s so easy to see that they’ll blame this on me 
[02:45.91]
[02:46.08]All I ever wanted 
[02:48.03]all I ever wanted 
[02:50.17]was a simple way to get over you
