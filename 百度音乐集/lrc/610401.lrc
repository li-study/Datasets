[00:12]Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
[00:18]people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
[00:35]All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
[00:41]Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
[00:49]Can you help me occupy my brain?
[00:55]Oh yeah
[01:11]I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
[01:17]I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
[01:57]Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
[02:03]Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
[02:21]And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
[02:27]I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
