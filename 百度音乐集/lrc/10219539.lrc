[00:34.52]Now will you overcome this impression?
[00:44.92]When the life that you lead
[00:49.32]Is second guessing me?
[00:54.37]So you've come for things you left behind
[01:05.13]You left me here with all this on my mind

[01:38.58]All I want to feels is affected
[01:49.14]When all you want to be is protected
[01:58.11]And when you realize you're on your own
