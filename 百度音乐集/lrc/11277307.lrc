[00:06.36]Barbra Streisand
[00:09.36]
[00:34.48]Memories light the corners of my mind
[00:46.01]Misty water color memories
[00:53.21]Of the way we were
[01:02.30]Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
[01:13.89]Smiles we gave to one another
[01:21.45]Fore the way we were
[01:30.06]Can't it be that it was all so simple then
[01:36.77]Or has time rewritten every line
[01:43.78]And if we had the chance to do it all again
[01:49.93]Tell me would we, could we
[02:00.42]
[02:00.93]Memories maybe beautiful and yet
[02:12.12]What's too painful to remember
[02:18.97]We simply choose to forget
[02:26.89]So it's the laughter, we will remember
[02:39.57]Whenever we remember the way we were
[02:54.59]the way we were
[03:04.75]
