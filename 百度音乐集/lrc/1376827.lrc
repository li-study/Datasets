[00:03.00]Michael Bolton-A Love So Beautiful
[00:08.00]
[00:16.83]The summer sun went down on
[00:19.93]Our love long ago
[00:26.32]But in my heart I feel the same
[00:30.17]Old afterglow
[00:33.18]
[03:21.06][02:07.82][00:35.91]A love so beautiful
[03:28.95][02:15.74][00:43.92]In every way
[03:35.90][02:53.30][02:22.97][00:50.93]A love so beautiful
[03:42.24][02:59.29][02:29.17][00:57.47]We let it slip away
[01:03.39]
[01:05.72]We were too young to understand
[01:09.40]To ever know
[01:15.22]That lovers drift apart
[01:17.88]And that's the way love goes
[01:21.71]
[01:22.81]A love so beautiful
[01:30.96]A love so free
[01:38.13]A love so beautiful
[01:44.32]A love for you and me
[01:51.02]
[02:37.70][01:52.89]And when I think of you
[02:44.39][01:59.51]I fall in love again
[02:06.20]
[03:34.39]End
