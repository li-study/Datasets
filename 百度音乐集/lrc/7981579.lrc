[00:02.00]In This Moment - The Dream
[00:12.00]
[00:35.03]Lavender clouds
[00:42.34]Nothing matters here
[00:47.74]Flying above
[00:53.72]The ultraviolet sphere
[01:03.13]And I will not look down
[01:12.80]I am falling down the rabbit hole
[01:19.24]Come so come with me and float
[01:30.04]Into the never ending dream
[01:35.73]
[01:36.91]We see God
[01:43.16]In the morning sun
[01:49.20]Touching the moon
[01:55.10]Our birth has just begun
[02:05.19]And I will not come down
[02:14.02]I'm falling down the rabbit hole
[02:21.02]Come so come with me and float
[02:31.51]Into the never ending dream
[02:40.17]
