[00:38.50]there's a place that i know where the sycamores grow
[00:47.64]and daffodils have their fun
[00:56.50]where the cares of the day seems to slowly fade away
[01:05.54]and the glow of the evening sun
[01:12.80]peace when the day is done
[01:21.64]if i go there real late,
[01:25.44]let my mind meditate
[01:29.74]on everything to be done
[01:38.64]if i search deep inside, let my conscience
[01:43.54]be my guide
[01:46.55]then the answers are sure to come
[01:54.84]don't have to worry none
[02:01.20]
[02:41.64]when you find a piece of mind
[02:45.74]leave you worries behind
[02:50.84]don't say that it can't be done
[02:58.74]with a new point of view
[03:01.80]life's true meaning comes to you
[03:06.49]and the freedom you seek is one
[03:14.79]peace is for everyone
[03:22.64]peace is for everyone
[03:31.74]peace is for everyone
