[00:00.00]Ricky Martin - I Am Made Of You
[00:24.83]I came a long way
[00:27.02]From out of nowhere
[00:30.20]I stand before you
[00:32.39]All alone
[00:35.97]Like a wolf's cry in the distance
[00:40.39]I heard the calling
[00:43.22]Of your soul
[00:46.58]Oh...I hear you cryin'
[01:42.43][00:52.19]With your love
[01:44.43][00:54.31]Show me how to live
[01:47.77][00:57.60]'Cause you are made of me
[01:50.35][01:00.24]And I am made of you
[01:53.49][01:03.23]With your life
[01:55.55][01:05.36]Show me how to give
[01:58.97][01:08.84]You are made of me
[02:01.42][01:11.36]And I am made of you
[01:15.58]We'll walk together
[01:17.05]Though the fire
[01:19.84]Though the darkness
[01:22.41]To the sun
[01:26.35]Like two raging rivers full of passion
[01:30.77]At the ocean
[01:33.44]We are one
[01:36.70]Oh...I hear you cryin'
[02:16.55]I am made of you
[02:19.48]You are made of me
[02:22.54]And everything you are
[02:24.83]Is what I'm meant to be
[02:27.76]I am made of you
[02:30.45]You are made of me
[02:33.20]And everything I am
[02:35.89]Is what you made of me
[02:38.91]Oh...I hear you crying
[02:43.67]Oh...Through the darkness
[02:47.38]To the light
[02:49.50]With your love
[02:51.36]Show me how to live
[02:54.50]'Cause you are made of me
[02:57.37]And I am made of you

[03:16.87]'Cause you are made of me
[03:19.68]And I am made of you
[03:22.79]With your soul
[03:24.90]Walk my spirit through
[03:28.26]You are made of me
[03:30.87]And I am made of you
[03:33.86]Oh...I hear you crying
[03:40.79]Through the darkness
[03:43.24]To the light...
