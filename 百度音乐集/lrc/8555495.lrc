[00:03.40]Majorie Hill-The Rose
[00:08.20]
[00:08.88]Some say love it is a river
[00:15.40]That drowns the tender reed
[00:22.52]Some say love it is a razor
[00:30.56]That leaves your soul to bleed
[00:37.02]Some say love it is a hunger
[00:44.63]And endless aching need
[00:52.91]I say love it is a flower
[01:00.71]And you its only seed
[01:11.34]It's the heart afraid of breaking
[01:18.78]That never learns to dance
[01:25.37]It's the dream afraid of waking
[01:33.75]That never takes the chance
[01:40.64]It's the one who won't be taken
[01:48.30]Who can not seem to give
[01:55.81]And the soul afraid of dying
[02:03.39]That never learns to live
[02:11.52]When the night has been too lonely
[02:21.76]And the road has been too long
[02:28.65]And you think that love is only
[02:35.76]For the lucky and the strong
[02:43.21]Just remember in the winter
[02:51.47]Far beneath the bitter snow
[02:58.83]Lies the seed that with the sun's love
[03:06.29]In the spring becomes the rose
