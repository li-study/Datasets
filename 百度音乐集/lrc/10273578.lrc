[00:02.00]Jack Johnson - If I Had Eyes
[00:07.00]
[00:20.59]If I had eyes in the back of my head
[00:24.94]I would have told you that you looked good as I walked away
[00:31.49]
[00:40.59]And if you could've tried to trust the hand that fed
[00:45.46]You would've never been hungry but you never really be
[00:53.61]
[01:01.17]The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
[01:06.76]or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore
[01:14.64]
[01:16.22]Sometimes time doesn't heal no not at all
[01:22.42]Just stand still while we fall
[01:27.60]In or out of love again I doubt I'm gonna win you back
[01:33.02]When you got eyes like that It won't let me in
[01:40.81]Always looking out
[01:45.54]
[02:03.60]Lot of people spend their time just floating
[02:09.07]We were victims together but lonely
[02:14.50]You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
[02:19.70]Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
[02:25.06]Building with bent nails we're falling but holding
[02:29.96]I don't wanna take up anymore of your time
[02:37.81]Time time time
[02:39.72]Sometimes time doesn't heal no not at all
[02:45.21]Just stand still while we fall
[02:50.97]In or out of love again I doubt I'm gonna win you back
[02:58.12]When you got eyes like that It won't let me in
[03:04.89]Always looking out
[03:09.37]
[03:14.96]Always lookin
[03:25.10]Always lookin
[03:35.35]Always lookin
[03:46.01]Always lookin
