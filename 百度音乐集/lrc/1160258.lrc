[00:00.00]Jennifer Lopez - Again
[01:30.37]
[01:32.37]Like an angel of the sky, you came
[01:37.13]Clearing up all the clouds, the sadness and the rain
[01:44.16]So pure and healing was the love you bring
[01:49.51]I knew inside it felt so right
[01:54.29]
[01:55.28]For me I've struggled all my life
[02:01.30]To find that thing that makes it right
[02:07.24]With you it seems I may have found
[02:12.86]Some other kind of love
[02:16.61]
[02:19.52]I will love you all my life
[02:25.36]Always be by your side
[02:31.01]And I will give you all I have
[02:37.05]'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
[02:45.92]Again, again
[02:52.44]
[02:55.11]I was scared to let go and trust your love
[03:00.82]After what I've been through I have had enough
[03:06.88]Whisperin' through your eyes, you never said a word
[03:12.63]But something said you're insane
[03:18.06]
[03:18.49]For me I've struggled all my life
[03:24.36]To find that thing that makes it right
[03:30.25]With you it seems I may have found
[03:35.87]Some other kind of love
[03:39.98]
[03:42.62]I will love you all my life
[03:48.49]Always be by your side
[03:54.09]And I will give you all I have
[04:00.16]'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
[04:09.08]Again
[04:11.95]
[04:30.11]A friend is what you'll always have in me
[04:35.74]I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
[04:41.67]And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
[04:47.60]You'll forever be a sacred part of me
[04:53.05]
[04:53.89]I will love you all my life
[04:59.75]Always be by your side
[05:05.34]And I will give you all I have
[05:11.55]'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
[05:20.32]Again, again
[05:26.64]
