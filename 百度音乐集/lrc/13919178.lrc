[00:31.48]The light was leaving
[00:33.19]in the west it was blue
[00:34.96]The children's laughter sang
[00:39.49]and skipping just like the stones they threw
[00:42.87]the voices echoed across the way
[00:49.57]its getting late
[00:54.74]It was just another night
[00:59.57]with the sun set
[01:01.38]and the moon rise not so far behind
[01:07.26]to give us just enough light
[01:10.21]to lay down underneath the stars
[01:15.12]listen to papas translations
[01:18.12]of the stories across the sky
[01:22.94]we drew our own constellations
[01:42.16]The west winds often last too long
[01:45.48]the wind may calm down
[01:47.69]nothing ever feels the same
[01:49.95]Sheltered under the Kamani tree
[01:53.53]waiting for the passing rain
[01:57.61]clouds keep moving to uncover the scene
[02:01.20]stars above are chasing the day away
[02:05.62]to find the stories that we sometimes need
[02:09.16]Listen close enough
[02:12.10]all else fades
[02:16.49]fades away
[02:20.95]It was just another night
[02:25.82]with the sun set
[02:27.45]and the moon rise not so far behind
[02:33.55]to give us just enough light
[02:36.43]to lay down underneath the stars
[02:41.40]listen to all the translations
[02:44.21]of the stories across the sky
[02:49.14]we drew our own constellations
