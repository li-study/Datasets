[00:02.66]演唱: Corinne Bailey Rae
[00:04.00]
[00:07.32]It's late and I'm feeling so tired
[00:09.53]Having trouble sleeping
[00:17.16]This constant compromise
[00:20.52]Between thinking and breathing
[00:25.92]Could it be I'm suffering
[00:28.94]Because I'll never give in
[00:31.69]Won't say that I'm falling in love
[00:36.64]Tell me I don't see myself
[00:40.24]Couldn't I blame something else
[00:45.01]Don't say I'm falling in love
[00:49.27]Some kind of therapy
[00:52.79]Is all I need
[00:57.25]Please believe me
[01:02.80]Some instant remedy
[01:06.39]That can cure me completely
[01:11.75]Could it be I'm suffering
[01:14.72]Because I'll never give in
[01:17.42]Won't say that I'm falling in love
[01:22.51]Tell me I don't see myself
[01:25.34]Couldn't I blame something else
[01:29.91]Don't say I'm falling in love
[01:37.36]Cause I've been there before
[01:39.74]It's not enough
[01:41.50]So nobody say it
[01:44.17]Don't even say it
[01:47.22]I got my eyes shut
[01:49.82]Whoah, no
[01:50.97]Whoah, no, no, no
[01:54.30]Could it be I'm suffering
[01:57.05]Because I'll never give in
[01:59.70]Won't say that I'm falling in love
[02:04.73]Tell me I don't see myself
[02:07.55]Couldn't I blame something else
[02:12.24]Don't say I'm falling in love
[02:15.70]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[02:21.01]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[02:26.15]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[02:31.47]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[02:37.39]
[02:57.97]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[03:03.19]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[03:08.43]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[03:13.70]Don't say that I'm falling in love
[03:26.00]
