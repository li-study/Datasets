[00:42.61]Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
[00:52.88]She probably had less than every one of us
[01:03.34]But when she knew how to walk she knew
[01:11.14]how to bring the house down
[01:13.54]Can't blame her for her beauty
[01:17.98]She wins with her hands down
[01:21.14]
[01:24.10]Jezebel, what a belle
[01:30.38]Looks like a princess in her new dress
[01:35.36]How did you get that?
[01:38.05]Do you really want to know she said
[01:44.94]It would seem she's on her way
[01:49.78]It's more, more than just a dream
[01:54.92]She put on her stockings and shoes
[01:58.83]had nothing to lose - she said it was worth it
[02:04.47]
[02:06.06]Reach for the top
[02:09.33]and the sun is gonna shine
[02:15.66]Every winter was a war she said
[02:19.69]I want to get what's mine
[02:24.74]
[03:07.94]Jezebel, Jezebel
[03:16.80]won't try to deny where she came from
[03:21.85]You can see it in her pride
[03:27.13]and the raven in her eyes
[03:29.71]Try show her a better way
[03:34.07]she'll say you don't know what you've been missing
[03:42.80]by the time she blinks you know she won't be listening
[03:49.07]
[03:50.14]Reach for the top she said
[03:53.07]the sun is gonna shine
[03:59.51]Every winter was a war she said
[04:03.71]I want to get what's mine
