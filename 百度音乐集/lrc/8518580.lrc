[00:00.98]SOMETHING MORE
[00:02.01]Written by Aly Michalka, AJ Michalka, & C. Michalka
[00:02.38]From Into the Rush
[00:02.70]Lyrics typed from CD booklet
[00:08.70]
[00:13.20]I didn\'t know what was in store
[00:17.26]When I walked right through the door
[00:22.42]Then I saw you over there
[00:27.47]Our blue eyes locked in a stare
[00:32.67]I didn\'t know quite what to say
[00:39.10]Sometimes words get in the way
[00:42.31]And I remember
[00:45.50]The night you said let\'s go for
[00:47.93]A ride I - didn\'t want the night to end
[00:52.44]Would we be - more than friends?
[00:57.21]Yet little did I know before
[01:00.08]We would be something more
[01:08.09]In black and white I read the screen
[01:12.33]All your lines and in between
[01:18.62]And then your message on the phone
[01:22.60]I saved to hear when all alone
[01:27.68]And now I know just what to say
[01:33.28]This doesn\'t happen everyday
[01:37.12]And I remember
[01:40.61]The night you said let\'s go for
[01:43.04]A ride I - didn\'t want the night to end
[01:47.34]Would we be - more than friends?
[01:52.28]Yet little did I know before
[01:54.76]We would be something more
[01:58.40]Something more, something more
[02:00.42]Na na na na - na na na na - yeah
[02:02.88]We would be something more,
[02:05.33]Something more, something more
[02:07.56]I know we\'re both young, but we know how we feel
[02:07.75]Na na na na - na na na na - yeah
[02:23.44]We know what is false, and we know what is real
[02:29.43]I remember
[02:32.57]The night you said let\'s go for
[02:35.26]A ride I - didn\'t want the night to end
[02:39.77]And I remember
[02:42.47]The night you said let\'s go for
[02:45.61]A ride I - didn\'t want the night to end
[02:49.84]Would we be - more than friends?
[02:54.89]Yet little did I know before
[02:57.30]We would be something more
[03:00.43]I remember
[03:02.58]The night you said let\'s go for
[03:04.95]A ride I - didn\'t want the night to end
[03:10.12]Would we be - more than friends?
[03:14.24]Yet little did I know before
[03:16.66]We would be something more
[03:21.33]Something more, something more
[03:22.56]Na na na na - na na na na - yeah
[03:24.44]Something more, something more
[03:27.36]Na na na na - na na na na - yeah
[03:29.51]Something more, something more
[03:32.89]Na na na na - na na na na - yeah
