[00:14.33]Play it so safe to stay on top.
[00:21.24]Shake it, imitate it, but it still sounds old.
[00:27.99]We just can't understand why the man calls it lo-fi.
[00:34.78]So get your bags packed now and I'll meet you on the outside.
[00:42.05]"X"-out all self-supervision...get your keys out, now start the ignition.
[00:49.07]We're on the verge of...All right!
[01:02.96]
[01:09.92]When you're shipwrecked on your mattress I'll come in and show you how
[01:16.82]To hijack the past and wind up in the right now.
[01:23.66]Grag some clothes, three chords and a video camera.
[01:30.33]Maybe a mic, some handwipes, a typewriter, and a hammer.
[01:37.78]"X"-out all self-supervision...get your keys out, now start the ignition.
[01:44.86]We're on the verge of...All right!
[01:58.72]
[02:12.02]Why don't you come over now?
[02:19.26]'Cause you know when you're around I can't get enough.
[02:25.95]I'm gonna follow you, wait, straight into the late night.
[02:33.05]'Cause you're so on fire and you already know.
[02:41.46]"X"-out all self-supervision...get your keys out, now start the ignition.
[02:48.24]A-O-A-O do it so right
[02:51.77]A-O-A-O do it tonight
[02:55.15]A-O-A-O do it so right
[02:58.42]A-O-A-O do it tonight
[03:02.11]We're on the verge of...All right!
