[00:00.79]Album:Absolution
[00:02.09]Title:Falling Away With You
[00:20.55]I can't remember when it was good
[00:30.33]moments of happiness elude
[00:35.32]maybe I just misunderstood
[00:40.40]all of the love we left behind
[00:45.29]watching the flash backs intertwine
[00:50.08]memories I will never find
[00:55.17]so I'll love whatever you become
[01:00.06]and forget the reckless things we've done
[01:05.15]I think our lives have just begun
[01:10.45]I think our lives have just begun
[01:15.84]and I feel my world crumbling,
[01:27.01]I feel my life crumbling
[01:36.38]I feel my soul crumbling away
[01:47.75]and falling away,
[01:54.25]falling away with you
[02:09.90]staying awake to chase a dream
[02:28.96]tasting the air you're breathing in
[02:33.95]I hope I won't forgot a thing
[02:38.93]promise to hold you close and pray
[02:43.53]watching the fantasies decay
[02:48.32]nothing will ever stay the same
[02:53.10]and all of the love we threw away
[02:58.09]and all of the hopes we've cherished fade
[03:03.18]making the same mistakes again
[03:07.87]making the same mistakes again
[03:13.46]I can feel my world crumbling,
[03:23.63]I can feel my life crumbling
[03:33.51]I can feel my soul crumbling away
[03:44.89]and falling away,
[03:50.77]falling away with you
[04:07.54]all of the love we left behind
[04:17.36]watching the flash backs intertwine
[04:23.10]memories I will never find
[04:28.69]memories I will never find
