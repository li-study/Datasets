[00:00.00]Bing Crosby - White Christmas
[00:08.66]
[00:10.92]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:20.99]Just like the ones I used to know.
[00:29.12]Where the treetops glisten,
[00:35.17]And children listen
[00:40.08]To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
[00:49.61]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[01:00.58]With every Christmas card I write.
[01:08.29]May your days be merry and bright.
[01:18.34]And may all your Christmases be white.
[01:31.66]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[01:40.25]Just like the ones I used to know.
[01:48.21]Where the treetops glisten,
[01:53.90]And children listen
[01:58.42]To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
[02:11.06]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[02:18.98]With every Christmas card I write.
[02:27.23]May your days be merry and bright.
[02:37.55]And may all your Christmases be white.
