[00:02.64]歌曲:Me And My Monkey
[00:05.02]歌手:Robbie Williams
[00:08.04]
[00:31.68]There was me and my monkey
[00:35.59]And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking filter tips
[00:40.55]Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged jet black Chevrolet
[00:47.23]He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his face)
[00:54.89]He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said 'no'
[00:57.79]He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a change of pace'
[01:03.78]And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs
[01:10.32]He said 'I left my wallet in El Segondo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
[01:19.67]We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel
[01:27.40]Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well?
[01:34.55]He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
[01:42.10]'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then we've got a monkey bed!'
[01:50.60]Me and my monkey
[01:54.13]With a dream and a gun
[01:58.42]I'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone
[02:06.08]Me and my monkey
[02:08.00]Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
[02:13.84]Trying to understand why he did what he did
[02:17.71]Why he did what he did
[02:20.39]We got the elevator, I hit the 33rd floor
[02:27.67]We had a room up top with the panoramic views like nothing you'd ever seen before
[02:36.60]He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
[02:43.60]He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages
[02:46.07]Called up escort services and ordered some okey doke
[02:52.63]Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
[02:58.92]In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with three monkey whores
[03:07.78]'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls
[03:15.77]Lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll rock your world'
[03:23.32]So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my gun
[03:30.70]Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
[03:38.80]There came a knock at the door and in walked Sunshine
[03:45.29]'What's up? You'd better get your ass in here boy,
[03:48.34]your monkey's having too much of a good time!'
[03:54.27]Me and my monkey
[03:56.98]Drove in search of the sun
[04:02.10]Me and my monkey
[04:04.43]Don't point that gun at anyone
[04:09.84]Me and my monkey
[04:12.34]Like Billy The Kid
[04:17.56]Trying to understand why he did what he did
[04:21.17]Why he did what he did
[04:24.67]Got tickets to see Sheena Easton, the monkey was high
[04:32.91]Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
[04:41.04]We left before encores, he couldn't sit still
[04:49.06]Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill
[04:56.68]We went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three
[05:04.38]Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
[05:12.14]Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure
[05:19.70]It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
[05:27.40]Now don't test my patience 'cause we're not about to run
[05:35.06]That's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
[05:42.67]'My name is Rodriguez', he says with death in his eye
[05:49.96]'I've been chasing you for a long time amigos, and now your monkey's gonna die!'
[05:58.37]Me and my monkey
[06:01.18]Drove in search of the sun
[06:05.89]Me and my monkey
[06:08.56]We don’t wanna kill no Mexican
[06:12.21]But we got ten itchy fingers
[06:16.94]One thing to declare
[06:21.10]When the monkey is high
[06:23.70]You do not stare
[06:25.88]You do not stare
[06:34.99]You do not stare
[06:44.52]Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
[06:48.81]And I ain’t about to run
[06:52.25]Put your gun down boy
[06:56.55]How'd I get mixed up with this fuckin' monkey anyhow
