[00:16.53]Groove Coverage - Moonlight Shadow
[00:26.53]The last that ever she saw him,
[00:30.63]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[00:34.46]He passed on worried and warning,
[00:38.25]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[00:42.15]Lost in the riddle last Saturday night,
[00:45.71]far away on the other side,
[00:49.29]he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
[00:53.24]and she couldn't find how to push through.
[00:58.42]The trees that whisper in the evening,
[01:02.73]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[01:06.48]Sing the song of sorrow and grieving
[01:10.20]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[01:13.98]All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
[01:17.76]far away on the other side,
[01:21.16]he was shot six times by a man on the run,
[01:25.06]and she couldn't find how to push through.
[01:30.91]I stay
[01:32.97]I pray
[01:34.52]I see you in heaven far away,
[01:39.09]I stay
[01:40.40]I pray
[01:41.97]I see you in heaven one day
[01:48.32]
[01:59.57]Four a.m. in the morning,
[02:02.74]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[02:06.41]I watched your vision forming,
[02:10.54]carried away by a moonlight shadow.
[02:14.01]Star was glowin' in a slivery night,
[02:17.98]far away on the other side,
[02:21.24]will you come to talk to me this night
[02:25.12]but she couldn't find how to push through.
[02:31.63]I stay
[02:32.83]I pray
[02:34.40]I see you in heaven far away,
[02:38.78]I stay
[02:40.33]I pray
[02:41.97]I see you in heaven one day.
[02:48.78]
[03:08.21]Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
[03:16.04]The night was heavy and the air was alive
[03:19.31]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:26.91]Far away on the other side
[03:30.50]The night was heavy and the air was alive
[03:34.35]But she couldn't find how to push through
[03:38.71]she couldn't find how to push through
