[00:19.42]
[02:06.07][00:20.95]When I fall I love it will be forever
[02:19.68][00:33.56]or I I never fall in love
[02:31.45][00:45.32]In a restless world like this is
[02:38.52][00:51.99]Love is ended before it begun
[02:45.74][00:57.44]And too many moonlight kisses
[02:52.88][01:02.99]Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
[03:01.24][01:10.99]When I give my heart
[03:07.76][01:17.39]it will be completely
[03:14.74][01:24.52]or I never give my heart
[03:26.79][01:36.69]And the moment I can feel that
[03:34.12][01:44.49]you feel that way too
[03:43.93][01:52.41]is when I fall in love
[04:03.16][01:57.54]with you
[03:50.35]when I fall in love
[03:57.10]when I fall in love
