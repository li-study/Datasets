[00:00.84]Here I stand alone
[00:04.09]With this weight upon my heart
[00:07.36]And it will not go away
[00:14.19]In my head I keep on looking back
[00:18.32]Right back to the start
[00:20.90]Wondering what it was that made you change
[00:26.21]
[00:27.83]Well I tried
[00:30.01]But I had to draw the line
[00:34.50]And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind
[00:40.40]
[00:43.22]What if I had never let you go
[00:49.68]Would you be the man I used to know
[00:56.75]If I'd stayed
[00:58.42]If you'd tried
[01:00.10]If we could only turn back time
[01:04.72]But I guess we'll never know
[01:12.17]
[01:15.63]Many roads to take
[01:18.96]Some to joy
[01:20.29]Some to heart-ache
[01:22.38]Anyone can lose their way
[01:28.45]And if I said that we could turn it back
[01:33.27]Right back to the start
[01:35.61]Would you take the chance and make the change
[01:41.47]
[01:42.80]Do you think how it would have been sometimes
[01:49.07]Do you pray that I'd never left your side
[01:55.22]
[01:56.30]What if I had never let you go
[02:02.95]Would you be the man I used to know
[02:10.10]If I'd stayed
[02:11.77]If you'd tried
[02:13.39]If we could only turn back time
[02:18.62]But I guess we'll never know
[02:24.96]
[02:36.28]If only we could turn the hands of time
[02:42.43]If I could take you back would you still be mine
[02:47.56]
[02:49.33]'Cos I tried
[02:50.97]But I had to draw the line
[02:55.68]And still this question keep on spinning in my mind
[03:01.31]
[03:04.89]What if I had never let you go
[03:11.40]Would you be the man I used to know
[03:18.10]What if I had never walked away
[03:24.70]'Cos I still love you more than I can say
[03:31.93]If I'd stayed
[03:33.58]If you'd tried
[03:35.08]If we could only turn back time
[03:41.21]But I guess we'll never know
[03:51.99]We'll never know
[03:56.98]
