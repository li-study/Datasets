[00:03.85]Can't Fight This Feeling
[00:05.85]
[00:06.85]I can't fight this feeling any longer
[00:12.83]And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
[00:19.00]What started out as friendship has grown stronger
[00:24.86]I only wish I had the strength to let it show
[00:28.98]
[00:31.25]And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
[00:37.21]You're a candle in the window
[00:40.13]on a cold, dark winter's night
[00:43.41]And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might
[00:52.50]
[00:54.41]And I can't fight this feeling anymore
[01:00.23]I've forgotten what I started fighting for
[01:06.35]It's time to bring this ship into the shore
[01:11.04]And throw away the oars
[01:14.60]Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
[01:19.57]
[01:23.74]My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
[01:29.51]I've been running round in circles in my mind
[01:35.61]And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
[01:41.61]Cause you take me to the places that I know I'd never find
[01:49.11]
[01:49.78]And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
[01:55.59]You're a candle in the window
[01:58.57]on a cold, dark winter's night
[02:02.13]And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might
[02:10.72]
[02:12.76]And I can't fight this feeling anymore
[02:18.78]I've forgotten what I started fighting for
[02:24.94]It's time to bring this ship into the shore
[02:29.52]And throw away the oars, forever
[02:35.49]
[02:37.15]Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
[02:43.40]I've forgotten what I started fighting for
[02:49.64]And if I have to crawl upon the floor
[02:54.20]Come crashing through your door
[02:57.07]Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore ~
[03:05.25]
[03:07.46]Woo~
