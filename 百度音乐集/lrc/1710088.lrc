[00:00.01]Leonard Cohen - You Have Loved Enough
[00:20.76]I said I’d be your lover.
[00:28.31]You laughed at what I said.
[00:36.03]I lost my job forever.
[00:43.32]I was counted with the dead.
[00:51.10]I swept the marble chambers,
[00:58.52]But you sent me down below.
[01:06.31]You kept me from believing
[01:13.92]Until you let me know:
[01:21.61]That I am not the one who loves
[01:27.17]It’s love that seizes me.
[01:36.62]When hatred with his package comes,
[01:41.80]You forbid delivery.
[01:49.06]And when the hunger for your touch
[01:56.09]Rises from the hunger,
[02:04.46]You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
[02:11.44]Now let me be the Lover.\"
[02:19.64]And when the hunger for your touch
[02:26.61]Rises from the hunger,
[02:34.83]You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
[02:41.71]Now let me be the Lover.\"
[03:23.53]I swept the marble chambers,
[03:30.93]But you sent me down below.
[03:38.86]You kept me from believing
[03:46.33]Until you let me know:
[03:53.98]That I am not the one who loves
[04:03.82]It’s love that chooses me.
[04:09.95]When hatred with his package comes,
[04:14.45]You forbid delivery.
[04:21.71]And when the hunger for your touch
[04:28.61]Rises from the hunger.
[04:36.87]You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
[04:43.94]Now let me be the Lover.\"
[04:51.93]And when the hunger for your touch
[04:59.22]Rises from the hunger.
[05:07.29]You whisper, \"You have loved enough,
[05:14.21]Now let me be the Lover...\"
