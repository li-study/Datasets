[00:17.21]
[00:19.21]Angie, Angie
[00:25.62]Wwhen will those dark clouds disappear
[00:33.32]Angie, Angie
[00:40.31]Where will it lead us from here
[00:46.31]With no loving in our souls
[00:50.01]And no money in our coats
[00:55.21]You can't say we're satisfied
[01:01.18]But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried
[01:13.99]
[01:16.75]Angie, you're beautiful
[01:22.21]But ain't it time we said goodbye
[01:30.63]Angie, I still love you
[01:36.95]Remember all those nights we cried
[01:41.39]
[01:42.22]All the dreams we held so close
[01:45.44]Seemed to all go up in smoke
[01:50.58]Let me whisper in your ear
[01:56.43]Angie, Angie
[02:03.78]Where will it lead us from here
[02:09.83]
[02:36.80]Oh, Angie, don't you weep
[02:40.28]All your kisses still taste sweet
[02:45.17]I hate that sadness in your eyes
[02:51.02]But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said goodbye
[03:05.82]
[03:17.67]With no loving in our souls
[03:21.08]And no money in our coats
[03:26.53]You can't say we're satisfied
[03:31.95]But angie, I still love you baby
[03:39.23]Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes
[03:46.19]There ain't a woman that comes close to you
[03:53.06]Come on baby, dry your eyes
[03:57.80]
[03:58.94]But Angie, Angie ain't it good to be alive
[04:13.46]Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried
