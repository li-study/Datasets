[00:14.88]Postcards and letters
[00:17.03]Pictures made to last forever
[00:21.36]To Be boxed up
[00:24.03]and tossed away
[00:26.58]Nick-nacs and Souvenirs
[00:30.98]In an afternoon
[00:32.84]They're out of here
[00:34.64]They'll disappear without a trace
[00:39.50]What they mean to me can never be replaced
[00:44.63]
[00:47.64]I can't unthink about you
[00:50.85]I can't unfeel your touch
[00:54.55]I can't unhear all the words
[00:56.86]Unsay all the things that used to mean so much
[01:01.88]I wish I could unremember
[01:04.30]Everything my hearts been through
[01:07.08]Im finding out its impossible to do
[01:14.14]Oh, its no use
[01:18.00]I cant unlove you
[01:27.18]Interstates and old songs
[01:27.37]
[01:29.87]Like time they go on and on
[01:32.55]I guess I could learn to do the same
[01:38.26]I could wake up without you
[01:42.89]These two arms not around you
[01:47.06]Tell myself it's meant to be this way
[01:51.60]No matter how I try
[01:56.07]Some things I can't change.
[01:57.65]
[01:59.51]I can't unthink about you
[02:02.59]I can't unfeel your touch
[02:06.16]I can't unhear all the words
[02:08.68]Unsay all the things that used to mean so much
[02:13.54]I wish I could unremember
[02:16.13]Everything my hearts been through
[02:20.50]Im finding out its impossible to do
[02:24.71]Oh, its no use
[02:30.56]I cant unlove you
[02:32.43]
[02:45.05]I wish I could unremember
[02:45.80]Everything my hearts been through
[02:51.90]Im finding out its impossible to do
[02:57.81]Its no use
[03:00.67]
[03:01.38]I cant unlove you
[03:06.82]
