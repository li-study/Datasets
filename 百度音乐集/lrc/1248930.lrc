[00:03.08]Just Take My Heart
[00:11.06]
[00:49.51]It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
[00:55.00]I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
[01:01.18]Wondering why so many questions have no answers
[01:06.47]I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong
[01:13.08]Where is our yesterday
[01:17.31]You and I could use it right now
[01:22.72]But if this is goodbye
[01:27.47]
[01:28.76]Just take my heart when you go
[01:34.47]I don't have the need for it anymore
[01:40.32]I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
[01:45.93]Just take my heart when you go
[01:50.64]
[02:00.76]Here we are about to take the final step now
[02:06.11]I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turing back
[02:12.03]Face to face it's been endless conversation
[02:17.40]But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk
[02:24.16]I'd give my everything
[02:28.25]If only I could turn you around
[02:33.84]But if this is goodbye
[02:38.61]
[02:39.80]Just take my heart when you go
[02:44.56]I don't have the need for it anymore
[02:51.24]I'll always love you but you're too hard to hold
[02:56.87]Just take my heart when you go
[03:25.38]Just take my heart when you go
[03:33.93]I don't have the need for it anymore
[03:39.58]I'll always love you but you're too hard to hold
[03:45.28]Just take my heart when you go
