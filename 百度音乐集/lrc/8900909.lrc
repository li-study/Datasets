[00:05.24]I Don\'t Wanna Cry
[00:08.76]Mariah Carey
[00:24.92]Once again we sit in silence
[00:32.32]After all is said and done
[00:39.65]Only emptiness inside us
[00:46.50]Baby, look what we\'ve become
[00:54.11]We can make a million promises
[00:56.99]But we still won\'t change
[01:01.34]It isn\'t right to stay together
[01:03.89]When you only bring each other pain
[01:08.80]I don\'t wanna cry
[01:12.25]Don\'t wanna cry
[01:15.58]Nothing in the world
[01:17.36]Could take us back
[01:19.11]To where we used to be
[01:22.19]Though I\'ve given you my heart and soul
[01:26.01](given you my heart and soul)
[01:29.15]I must find a way of letting go
[01:33.03]\'Cause baby,
[01:35.23]I don\'t wanna cry
[01:44.41]I don\'t wanna cry
[01:52.87]Too far apart to bridge the distance
[02:00.14]But something keeps us hanging on and on
[02:07.49]Pretending not to know the difference
[02:14.62]Denying what we had is gone
[02:22.20]Every moment we\'re together
[02:24.67]It\'s just breaking me down
[02:29.08]I know we swore it was forever
[02:31.99]But it hurts too much to stay around
[02:36.75]I don\'t wanna cry
[02:40.53]Don\'t wanna cry
[02:43.38]Nothing in the world
[02:45.55]Could take us back
[02:47.08]To where we used to be
[02:49.72]Though I\'ve given you my heart and soul
[02:54.28](given you my heart and soul)
[02:56.91]I must find a way of letting go
[03:00.82]\'Cause baby,
[03:03.61]I don\'t wanna cry
[03:11.91]I don\'t wanna cry
[03:20.80]All the magic\'s gone
[03:23.39]There\'s just a shadow of a memory
[03:28.69]Something just went wrong
[03:30.71]We can\'t go on make-believing
[03:33.02]on make-believing
[03:39.43]\'Cause I don\'t wanna cry
[03:42.97]Don\'t wanna cry
[03:45.76]Nothing in the world
[03:48.97]Could take us back
[03:49.80]To where we used to be
[03:53.08]Though I\'ve given you my heart and soul
[03:56.91](given you my heart and soul)
[04:00.39]I\'ve given you my heart and soul
[04:07.29]I must find a way of letting go
[04:11.05]\'Cause baby,
[04:13.33]I don\'t wanna cry
[04:29.21]I don\'t wanna cry
[04:35.76]I don\'t wanna cry
