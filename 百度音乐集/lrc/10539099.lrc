[00:-2.00]Taylor Swift - Speak Now
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:04.55]I am not the kind of girl
[00:07.71]Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
[00:12.45]But you are not the kind of boy
[00:15.94]Who should be marrying the wrong girl
[00:19.49]
[00:20.80]I sneak in and see your friends,
[00:24.17]And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
[00:28.51]And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
[00:32.19]Somewhere back inside a room
[00:34.26]Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
[00:36.78]This.. is.. surely not what you thought it would be
[00:44.70]I.. lose myself in a daydream
[00:51.00]Where I stand and say
[00:52.80]
[00:53.52]Don't say yes, run away now
[00:56.80]I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
[01:01.33]Don't wait or say a single vow
[01:04.84]You need to hear me out and they said speak now
[01:09.29]
[01:16.91]Fun gestures are exchanged
[01:20.73]And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
[01:25.10]And I am hiding in the curtains
[01:28.62]It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
[01:33.08]She.. floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
[01:40.93]I.. know.. you wish it was me
[01:47.15]You wish it was me don't you?
[01:49.20]
[01:50.00]Don't say yes, run away now
[01:53.32]I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
[01:57.88]Don't wait or say a single vow
[02:01.40]You need to hear me out and they said speak now
[02:05.50]
[02:06.15]Don't say yes, run away now
[02:09.40]I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
[02:14.08]Don't wait or say a single vow
[02:17.50]Your time is running out and they said speak now
[02:22.05]
[02:37.69]I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
[02:45.85]There's the silence, there's my last chance
[02:48.06]I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
[02:52.55]
[02:53.99]Horrified looks from everyone in the room
[02:57.70]But I'm only looking at you
[03:01.08]
[03:02.26]I am not the kind of girl
[03:05.31]Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
[03:09.95]But you are not the kind of boy
[03:13.43]Who should be marrying the wrong girl
[03:17.35]
[03:18.51]So don't say yes, run away now
[03:22.08]I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
[03:26.78]Don't wait or say a single vow
[03:30.06]You need to hear me out and they said speak now
[03:34.75]And you say lets run away now
[03:38.14]I'll meet when I'm out of my tux at the backdoor
[03:42.86]Baby I didn't say my vows,
[03:46.24]So glad you were around
[03:48.20]When they said 'Speak now'
[03:50.85]
