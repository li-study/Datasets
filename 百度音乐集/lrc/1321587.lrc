[00:23.53]Get up
[00:26.10]If you wanna survive
[00:28.89]Get oh so alive
[00:32.79]In your life
[00:34.28]Everything falling out the sky on top of you
[00:40.60]Now what you do
[00:45.45]Fill yourself up now
[00:48.69]It's the love of your life
[00:50.91][?] on me
[00:54.79]All I know
[00:56.42]Before it's gone
[00:58.55]I always feel scared in the town
[01:02.55]And nothing's wrong

[01:51.93]Give up
[01:54.67]If you wanna survive
[01:57.42]Pick the sun back up
[02:01.56]You got to get on the song lowly
[02:08.43]What's the point?
[02:10.39]It's funny 'til you left to kill yourself
[02:14.69]In this town
[02:16.49]
[02:17.65]So what's the matter with me?
[02:22.66]What's the matter with me?
[02:29.13]What's the matter with me?
[02:33.75]What's the matter with me?
[02:36.99]Me
