[00:30.19]If a plane crashed into my room
[00:33.48]I wouldn't even flinch
[00:35.04]I couldnt try to move
[00:37.70]My mind is on you
[00:41.31]My mind is on you
[00:44.79]
[00:45.79]If the streetlight smashed above me
[00:49.02]I wouldnt move an inch
[00:50.83]Turn the glass into stars
[00:53.00]And your face is the moon
[00:56.55]And the night turns to you
[00:58.60]Cos my mind is on you

[01:21.71]I can take anything
[01:23.27]
[01:24.14]If electric charges shock me
[01:26.94]I smile and fold my arms
[01:29.24]I feel nothing new
[01:30.73]Because my mind is on you
[01:32.85]
[01:34.53]My mind is on you
[01:37.20]
[01:38.94]And if the floor gives way to my shoes
[01:42.43]I wouldn't try to fly
[01:44.54]I cant explain why I feel
[01:47.65]I always feel you
