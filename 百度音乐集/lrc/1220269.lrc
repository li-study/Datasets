[00:01.13]We Belong To The Sea
[00:03.30]Aqua
[00:06.25]
[00:31.94]Take me to the ocean blue
[00:34.75]Let me dive right into
[00:37.55]Anything I'll ever capture
[00:42.08]You can wait up all night
[00:46.06]Waiting for wrong or right
[00:48.81]I always knew where I had you
[00:53.57]You can lie on my waves
[00:56.48]You can sleep in my caves
[00:59.29]Living on the edge of peace
[01:02.79]Knowing that water can freeze
[01:05.76]Do you still want me to open
[01:09.70]Come on into my waves
[01:13.38]You can sleep in my caves
[01:16.00]Let me know that you will hold me Till the tides take my soul
[01:21.47]We belong to the sea
[01:24.16]To the waves you and me
[01:27.32]Living in the ocean so blue
[01:32.93]We belong to the sea
[01:35.54]Open wide being free
[01:38.46]A minute everlasting with you
[01:42.17]
[01:44.72]And as soon as it stops
[01:47.29]We'll all be a drop
[01:50.08]Coming down on your wide open sea
[01:55.24]Can you wash me away
[01:59.30]Will you dry me one day
[02:02.24]Take me to the place where I came from
[02:05.74]
[02:08.44]If I had a open heart
[02:10.89]Would you tear that apart
[02:14.06]Why do I feel that you're lonesome
[02:18.38]Come on into my waves
[02:21.20]You can sleep in my caves
[02:23.84]Let me know that you will hold me Till the tides take my soul
[02:29.38]We belong to the sea
[02:31.97]To the waves you and me
[02:35.01]Living in the ocean so blue
[02:40.58]We belong to the sea
[02:43.27]Open wide being free
[02:46.27]A minute everlasting with you
[02:52.37]And as soon as it stops
[02:54.95]We'll all be a drop
[02:57.59]Coming down on your wide open sea
[03:01.44]
[03:03.77]There's a thunder inside me
[03:06.41]That your silence will kill
[03:09.15]And I know that you forced me
[03:11.97]To get rid of what I feel
[03:16.76]We belong to the sea
[03:20.28]To the waves you and me Living in the ocean so blue
[03:25.69]We belong to the sea Open wide being free
[03:31.35]A minute everlasting with you
[03:37.50]And as soon as it stops
[03:40.36]We'll all be a drop
[03:42.66]Coming down on your wide open sea
[03:46.78]
