[00:35.91]Oh,
[00:37.41]do you know,
[00:41.16]Where to go,
[00:45.73]where to go?
[00:55.63]Something on your mind,
[00:59.76]Wanna leave me behind,
[01:04.24]wanna leave me behind.
[01:10.54]
[01:17.48]You're spinning me around,
[01:19.79]My feet are off the ground.
[01:22.05]I dunno where I stand.
[01:24.31]Do you have to hold my hand?
[01:26.56]You mystify me,
[01:28.84]you mystify me, you mystify me...

[01:37.69]It happened oh so soon.

[01:44.16]You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me...
[01:50.67]
[02:13.30]And I couldn't find the words,
[02:15.17]To say, "I love you."
[02:17.54]And he couldn't find the time,
[02:19.71]To say, "I need you."
[02:22.02]It wouldn't come out right.
[02:24.40]It wouldn't come out right.
[02:27.33]Just came out all wrong.

[02:30.92]You're spinning me around,
[02:32.96]My feet are off the ground.
[02:35.30]I dunno where I stand.
