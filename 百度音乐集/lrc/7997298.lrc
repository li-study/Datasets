[00:-0.50]The Music Of The Night

[00:09.57]Night time sharpens heightens each sensation
[00:19.12]Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
[00:28.58]Silently the senses abandon their defences
[04:32.85][04:25.40][00:38.21]
[00:49.89]Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
[00:58.08]Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
[01:06.45]Turn your face away from the garish light of day
[01:14.15]Turn your face away from cold, unfeeling light
[01:21.21]And listen to the music of the night
[01:29.44]Close your eyes and Surrender to your darkest dreams!
[01:35.60]Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before!
[01:42.25]Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
[01:55.48]And you live as you're never lived before
[02:07.94]Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
[02:15.14]Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
[02:23.28]Open up your mind let your fantasies unwind
[02:30.69]In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
[02:37.40]The darkness of the music of the night
[02:46.14]Let your mind start a journey throught a strange new world
[02:51.93]Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
[02:58.74]Let your soul take you where you long to be
[03:12.61]Only then can you belong to me
[03:27.43]Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
[03:36.81]Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
[03:47.93]Let the dream begin
[03:52.35]Let your darker side give in
[03:59.26]To the harmony which dreams alone can write
[04:08.05]The power of the music of the night
[04:40.29]You alone can make my song take flight
[04:51.29]Help me make the music of the night
