[00:20.70]Let's get the story straight
[00:23.34]You were a poison
[00:26.10]You flooded through my veins
[00:28.88]You left me broken
[00:31.72]You tried to make me think
[00:34.44]That the blame was all on me
[00:36.83]With the pain you put me through
[00:39.46]And now I know that it's not me it's you
[00:43.10]
[00:43.98]It's not me it's you
[00:46.60]Always has been you
[00:49.40]All the lies and stupid things you say and do it's you
[00:54.99]It's not me it's you
[00:57.83]All the lies and pain you put me through
[01:01.77]I know that it's not me it's you
[01:05.41]You, You
[01:08.87]It's not me it's you, you
[01:13.65]
[01:16.23]So here we go again
[01:19.05]The same fight we're always in
[01:21.84]I don't care so why pretend
[01:24.51]Wake me when your lecture ends
[01:27.50]You tried to make me small
[01:30.15]Make me fall and it's all your fault
[01:32.60]With the pain you put me through
[01:35.27]And now I know that it's not me it's you
[01:38.71]
[01:39.77]It's not me it's you
[01:42.51]Always has been you
[01:45.22]All the lies and stupid things you say and do it's you
[01:50.68]It's not me it's you
[01:53.66]All the lies and pain you put me through
[01:57.63]I know that it's not me it's you
[02:00.67]
[02:12.04]Let's get the story straight
[02:14.99]You were a poison
[02:17.55]Flooding through my veins
[02:20.03]You driving me insane
[02:22.41]
[02:23.40]And now you're gone away
[02:26.18]I'm no longer choking
[02:28.44]From the pain you put me through
[02:31.13]And now I know that it's not me it's you
[02:34.78]
[02:35.77]It's not me it's
[02:37.59]YOU!
[02:38.71]Always has been you
[02:41.13]All the lies and stupid things you say and do it's you
[02:46.60]It's not me it's you
[02:49.48]All the lies and pain you put me through
[02:53.46]I know that it's not me it's you
[02:56.99]YOU!
[02:58.29]It's not me it's you,
[03:00.72]It's not me it's you,
[03:03.88]It's not me it's you,
[03:06.31]It's not me it's you,
[03:09.29]It's not me it's you,
