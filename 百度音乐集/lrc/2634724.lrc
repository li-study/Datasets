[00:09.55]
[00:14.06]And now the purple dusk of twilight time
[00:19.91]Steals across the meadows of my heart
[00:26.44]High up in the sky the little stars climb
[00:32.90]Always reminding me that we're apart
[00:39.64]
[00:41.21]You wander down the lane and far away
[00:47.91]Leaving me a song that will not die
[00:55.93]Love is now the stardust of yesterday
[01:04.15]The music of the years gone by
[01:13.56]
[01:13.58]Sometimes I wonder why I spend
[01:22.22]The lonely night dreaming of a song
[01:30.05]The melody haunts my reverie
[01:36.40]And I am once again with you
[01:41.88]When our love was new
[01:47.21]And each kiss an inspiration
[01:54.55]But that was long ago
[01:58.80]Now my consolation
[02:01.62]Is in the stardust of a song
[02:06.80]
[02:07.46]Beside a garden wall
[02:13.18]When stars are bright
[02:17.45]You are in my arms
[02:21.12]The nightingale tells his fairy tale
[02:26.99]A paradise where roses bloom
[02:32.28]Though I dream in vain
[02:39.09]In my heart it will remain
[02:45.23]My stardust melody
[02:50.63]The memory of love's refrain
[03:01.20]
[03:03.35]my only wish
