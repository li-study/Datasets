[00:00.00]Michael Buble - Crazy Love
[00:01.67]I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
[00:06.81]And the heavens open every time she smiles
[00:13.07]And when I come to her that's where I belong
[00:18.78]Yet I'm running to her like a rivers song
[00:25.34]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[00:31.32]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[00:38.64]She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
[00:44.15]And when I come to her when the sun goes down
[00:51.40]Take away my trouble, take away my grief
[00:57.16]Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief
[01:02.97]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[01:09.00]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[01:15.53]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[01:21.25]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[01:54.07]Yes I need her in the daytime
[02:00.30]Yes I need her in the night
[02:07.09]Yes I want to throw my arms around her
[02:12.59]Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight
[02:23.06]And when I'm returning from so far away
[02:28.36]She gives me some sweet lovin brighten up my day
[02:33.82]Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
[02:41.02]Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul
[02:45.98]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[02:52.36]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[02:58.94]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[03:05.17]She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
