[00:14.74]And if she asks you why,
[00:16.99]you can tell her that I told you
[00:19.04]That I'm tired of castles in the air.
[00:22.39]I've got a dream I want the world to share
[00:25.92]And castle walls just lead me to despair.
[00:33.35]Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
[00:37.46]A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
[00:41.19]I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
[00:44.34]The love we knew ain't worth another try.
[00:51.43]Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
[00:55.16]I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
[01:03.68]Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
[01:07.62]Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.
[01:15.24]But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
[01:19.88]In the hills, away from city strife.
[01:23.26]I need a country woman for my wife;
[01:26.62]I'm city born, but I love the country life.
[01:33.51]For I cannot be part of the cocktail generation:
[01:37.98]Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
[01:40.54]The music plays and everyone must dance.
[01:44.07]I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.
[01:51.16]Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
[01:55.07]I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
[02:03.45]Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
[02:07.33]Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.
[02:14.77]And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you
[02:19.81]That I'm tired of castles in the air.
[02:22.96]I've got a dream I want the world to share
[02:26.34]And castle walls just lead me to despair.
