[00:-3.00]Owl City - The Tip Of the Iceberg
[00:-2.00]

[00:01.00]
[00:02.10]Welcome back
[00:04.05]Winter once again
[00:07.84]And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
[00:10.40]Cuz you'll feel much better when
[00:14.72]
[00:15.89]The snowflakes fall
[00:18.16]Gently to the ground
[00:21.91]The temperature drops
[00:23.58]And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
[00:29.28]But I keep you warm
[00:31.93]
[00:44.70]If speed's a pro
[00:45.88]Inertia must be a con
[00:50.09]Cuz the cold wind blows at precise rates
[00:53.46]When I've got my ice skates on
[00:57.33]
[00:57.85]If all the roads
[00:59.33]Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
[01:04.31]I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
[01:07.49]Then on to Alaska and back
[01:11.62]Cuz you keep me warm
[01:14.21]
[01:27.16]Peer over the edge
[01:29.30]Can you see me?
[01:31.14]Rivulets flow from your eyes
[01:34.65]Paint runs from your mouth
[01:36.41]Like a waterfall
[01:38.17]And your lungs crystalize
[01:41.32]
[01:41.77]I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
[01:45.22]I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
[01:48.78]And that's just the tip of the iceberg
[01:52.33]I'll do whatever it takes
[01:55.18]To change
[01:57.50]
[02:26.12]Farewell powdery paradise
[02:32.86]We'd rather skate on the finished ice
[02:39.93]Fingers failed us before they froze
[02:47.12]Frostbite bit down on all our toes
[02:51.01]
[02:54.23]Snow drifts build up and enfold us
[02:58.48]As we wait out this winter storm
[03:01.75]So we snuggle close in the darkness
[03:05.37]And keep each other so warm
[03:13.70]
