[00:00.00][00:09.79]O Holy night
[00:03.00]Celine Dion
[00:06.00][00:29.94][02:16.00][04:32.05][04:55.46]
[00:14.55]the stars are brightly shining
[00:20.60]It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
[00:31.81]Long lay the world in sin and error pining
[00:42.41]Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
[00:53.69]A thrill of hope the weary world rejoyces
[01:03.76]For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
[01:13.94]Fall on your knees
[01:23.12]O hear the angel voices
[01:32.81][01:52.59]O night divine!
[01:42.35]O night when Christ was born
[02:03.29]O night, O night divine!
[02:43.97]And in His Name, all oppression shall cease
[02:55.07]Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
[03:05.12]Let all within us praise his holy name
[03:15.54]Christ is the Lord!
[03:25.12]Their name forever praise we
[03:35.44][03:55.81][04:16.58]Noel, Noel
[03:45.67][04:09.35]O night, O night Divine
[04:34.25]O night
[04:40.00]O holy night!
