[00:09.37]阿刍
[00:21.08]Waiting for the seven eighteen
[00:26.89]January is endless
[00:31.24]Weary-eyed and forlorn
[00:36.67]The Northern Line is the loudest
[00:41.40]Sitting in silence in bars after work
[00:46.59]I've got nothing to add or contest
[00:51.16]Can still kick a ball a hundred yards
[00:57.14]We cling to bottles
[00:59.74]and memories of the past
[01:03.40](Give me moments)
[01:08.27]Just give me moments (give me moments)
[01:14.03]Not hours or days (give me moments)
[01:19.78]Just give me moments (give me moments)
[01:26.71]Grinding your teeth
[01:29.01]in the middle of the night
[01:32.07]With the sadness of those molars
[01:36.33]Spend all your spare time
[01:39.47]trying to escape
[01:42.08]With crosswords and sudoku
[01:46.46]If I could do it again
[01:49.43]I'd make more mistakes
[01:52.26]I'd not be so scared of falling
[01:56.64]If I could do it again,
[01:59.51]I'd climb more trees
[02:02.47]I'd pick and I'd more wild
[02:07.89]blackberries
[02:09.70](Give me moments)
[02:13.45]Just give me moments (give me moments)
[02:19.21]Not hours or days (give me moments)
[02:25.30]Just give me moments (give me moments)
[02:32.21]Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
