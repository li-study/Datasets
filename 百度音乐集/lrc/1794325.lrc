[00:21.17]I watch you spin from afar
[00:32.31]I drink you in and breath you out
[00:43.16]I'm camouflaged by the timeline
[00:54.31]I'm camouflaged when the sun shines
[01:06.71]Two ships passing in the night
[01:17.72]Two lips pressing ground the tides
[01:28.98]I believe the world it spins for you
[01:39.97]We will never be, I am the moon
[01:51.24]I believe the world it spins for you
[02:02.57]We will never be, I am the moon
[02:13.49]I long to be a part
[02:24.07]I isolate my heart
[02:34.96]You've drawn me into your world
[02:46.65]Now I too spin limbless
[02:57.34]One hand clapping, where's the wind
[03:08.73]I stand spanning at your distant wings
[03:20.62]I believe the world it spins for you
[03:30.89]We will never be, I am the moon
[03:42.90]I believe the world it spins for you
[03:57.78]We will never be, I am the moon
[04:03.95]I believe the world it spins for you
[04:16.12]We will never be, I am the moon
