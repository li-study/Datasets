[00:01.01]MoZella - More of You
[00:04.83]
[00:12.00]So it goes without saying that I'm hooked on you
[00:17.96]And by now I'm out of my mind with this self-abuse
[00:24.67]I guess should have looked out for myself
[00:27.62]I guess that I could of found someone else
[00:30.76]But I never met anyone who's loving made me so damn crazy
[00:35.95]
[00:36.45]Every little thing that you do
[00:39.32]Every single word you say
[00:42.41]Every time you looking away
[00:44.06]You got me begging for more of you, more of you
[00:48.37]Every time I'm ready to go
[00:50.97]Every time I think I'm back in control
[00:54.28]Something gets a hold of my soul
[00:56.16]And I be begging for more of you, more of you
[00:59.90]
[01:02.53](I'm begging for more of you, mmm, I'm begging for more of you)
[01:11.03]
[01:11.90]You're a door I can't close when I'm running late
[01:18.00]When I see you I know that I'm tempting fate
[01:24.68]I guess that I should move on with my life
[01:27.75]Cause the state that I'm in is just not right
[01:30.75]But I never met anyone who's loving made me so damn crazy
[01:36.18]
[01:36.57]Every little thing that you do
[01:39.15]Every single word you say
[01:42.40]Every time you looking away
[01:44.11]You got me begging for more of you, more of you
[01:48.41]Every time I'm ready to go
[01:51.02]Every time I think I'm back in control
[01:54.34]Something gets a hold of my soul
[01:56.20]And I be begging for more of you, more of you
[01:59.85]
[02:00.42]Now I don't know where to go
[02:06.23]Should I put an end to this show
[02:12.00]But it's out of my hand (out of my hand)
[02:15.12]Cause I'm at your command (at your command)
[02:18.13]So what else can I do but get some more of you
[02:24.99]
[02:36.30]Every little thing that you do
[02:39.34]Every single word you say
[02:42.41]Every time you looking away
[02:44.11]You got me begging for more of you, more of you
[02:48.43]Every time I'm ready to go
[02:50.99]Every time I think I'm back in control
[02:54.36]Something gets a hold of my soul
[02:56.18]And I be begging for more of you, more of you
[03:00.39]Every time I'm ready to go
[03:03.23]Every time I think I'm back in control
[03:06.35]Something gets a hold of my soul
[03:08.16]And I be begging for more of you, more of you
[03:12.41]Every little thing that you do
