[00:07.00]How Deep Is Your Love
[03:35.00][03:06.00][02:11.00][00:17.00][00:13.00]
[00:19.00]I know your eyes in the morning sun
[00:23.00]I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
[00:28.00]And the moment that you wander far from me
[00:33.00]I wanna feel you in my arms again
[02:28.00][00:38.00]Then you come to me on a summer breeze
[02:32.00][00:42.00]Keep me warm in your love
[02:35.00][00:44.00]Then you softly leave
[02:37.00][01:42.00][00:47.00]And it's me you need to show
[03:42.00][03:40.00][03:13.00][03:11.00][02:44.00][02:42.00][02:40.00][01:49.00][01:47.00][01:46.00][00:54.00][00:52.00][00:51.00]How deep is your love
[03:46.00][03:16.00][02:46.00][01:52.00][00:56.00]I really mean to learn
[03:49.00][03:19.00][02:50.00][01:55.00][01:00.00]'Cause we're living in a world of fools
[03:54.00][03:24.00][02:54.00][02:00.00][01:05.00]Breaking us down
[03:57.00][03:26.00][02:57.00][02:03.00][01:08.00]When they all should let us be
[03:31.00][03:01.00][02:07.00][01:12.00]We belong to you and me
[01:15.00]I believe in you
[01:19.00]You know the door to my very soul
[01:24.00]You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
[01:28.00]You're my saviour when I fall
[01:32.00]And you may not think I care for you
[01:37.00]When you know down inside that I really do
