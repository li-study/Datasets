[00:00.21]Make You Feel My Love
[00:00.71]Bob Dylan
[00:01.21]
[00:02.21]When the rain is blowing in your face
[00:08.95]and the whole world is on your case
[00:15.92]I could offer a warm embrace
[00:22.34]to make you feel my love
[00:26.34]
[00:29.25]When evening shadows and the stars appear
[00:36.12]and there is no one there to dry your tears
[00:43.39]I could hold you for a million years
[00:49.67]to make you feel my love
[00:53.38]
[00:56.43]I know you haven't made your mind up yet
[01:03.38]but I would never do you wrong
[01:09.93]I've known it from the moment that we met
[01:16.23]no doubt in my mind where you belong
[01:20.18]
[01:23.88]I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
[01:30.68]I'd go crawling down the avenue
[01:37.37]Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
[01:43.71]to make you feel my love
[01:47.99]
[02:17.47]The storms are raging on the rolling sea
[02:23.97]and on the highway of regret
[02:30.50]the winds of change are blowing wild and free
[02:36.57]you ain't seen nothing like me yet
[02:42.43]
[02:43.41]I could make you happy, 
[02:45.62]make your dreams come true
[02:50.78]nothing that I wouldn't do
[02:57.03]go to the ends of the earth for you
[03:03.43]to make you feel my love
