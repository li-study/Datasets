[00:01.42]Long Long Journey
[00:03.07]Enya
[00:05.80]
[00:07.82]City lights shine on the harbor
[00:13.35]Night has fallen down
[00:18.47]Through the darkness and the shadow
[00:23.59]I will still go on
[00:28.72]Long Long Journey
[00:31.40]Through the darkness
[00:33.90]Long Long way to go
[00:38.31]But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home
[00:50.28]Where the road runs through the valley
[00:55.71]Where the river flows
[01:00.82]I will follow every highway
[01:05.95]To the place I know
[01:11.10]Long Long Journey
[01:13.71]Through the darkness
[01:16.23]Long Long way to go
[01:20.66]But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home
[01:32.61]Long Long Journey
[01:35.58]I don't know where
[01:38.12]Long Long way to go
[01:42.50]But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home
[01:56.22]
[02:17.32]Long Long Journey
[02:20.39]Through the darkness
[02:22.99]Long Long way to go
[02:27.50]But what are paths across the ocean to the heart that's coming home
[02:39.15]Long Long Journey
[02:42.24]I don't know where
[02:44.86]Long Long way to go
[02:49.27]But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home
