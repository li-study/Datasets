[00:15.79](Jagger/Richards)
[00:17.79]
[00:19.79]Love is strong
[00:21.82]And you're so sweet
[00:24.30]You make me hard
[00:26.18]You make me weak
[00:28.60]Love is strong
[00:30.60]And you're so sweet
[00:32.84]And some day, babe
[00:35.01]We got to meet
[00:36.64]
[00:46.09]A glimpse of you
[00:48.13]Was all it took
[00:50.19]A stranger's glance
[00:52.39]It got me hooked
[00:54.48]And I followed you
[00:56.73]Across the stars
[00:58.82]I looked for you
[01:01.04]In seedy bars
[01:03.50]
[01:14.16]What are you scared of, baby
[01:19.18]It's more than just a dream
[01:23.34]I need some time
[01:27.43]We make a beautiful team
[01:32.44]A beautiful team
[01:34.59]
[01:37.76]Love is strong
[01:39.95]And you're so sweet
[01:42.17]And some day, babe
[01:44.23]We got to meet
[01:46.41]Just anywhere
[01:48.56]Out in the park
[01:50.74]Out on the street
[01:52.86]And in the dark
[01:55.07]I followed you
[01:57.22]Through swirling seas
[01:59.36]Down darkened woods
[02:01.52]With silent trees
[02:03.29]
[02:03.76]Your love is strong
[02:05.83]And you're so sweet
[02:08.07]You make me hard
[02:10.17]You make me weak
[02:12.17]
[02:15.35]What are you scared of, baby
[02:19.57]It's more than just a dream
[02:23.65]I need some time
[02:28.11]We make a beautiful team
[02:33.01]Beautiful
[02:34.70]
[02:38.11]I wait for you
[02:40.37]Until the dawn
[02:42.43]My mind is ripped
[02:44.64]My heart is torned
[02:46.55]Your love is strong
[02:48.88]And you're so sweet
[02:51.00]Your love is bitter
[02:53.20]It's taken neat
[02:55.05]Love is strong, yeah
