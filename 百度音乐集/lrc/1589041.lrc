[00:12.27]Communication is never simple
[00:16.56]Especially when it's you that's on the receiving end
[00:22.14]As memories start to fade
[00:24.94]
[00:28.59]I know the road it takes no prisoners
[00:32.32]The only thing that comes between us is distances
[00:38.51]More and more each day
[00:41.27]
[00:43.12]Remember to tune into my heart wherever you are
[00:48.99]My frequency starts when we're apart
[00:53.06]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[00:59.26]
[01:00.25]Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
[01:04.83]My transmission starts when you're alone
[01:08.95]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[01:14.94]
[01:17.31]I know the journey's never easy
[01:20.47]When circumstances and dreams become a reality
[01:26.03]It's never quite the same
[01:29.66]
[01:32.56]I only hope that you get this message
[01:36.39]I only hope that a part of me can get through to you
[01:41.95]Across the empty space
[01:45.68]
[01:47.19]Remember to tune into my heart wherever you are
[01:52.86]My frequency starts when we're apart
[01:56.95]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[02:02.85]
[02:04.23]Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
[02:08.82]My transmission starts when you're alone
[02:12.97]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[02:18.86]
[02:20.60]Remember to tune into my heart
[02:22.88]Remember to tune into my heart
[02:27.33]Into my heart, into my heart
[02:31.21]Into my heart, into my heart
[02:34.83]
[02:36.14]Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
[02:40.92]My transmission starts when you're alone
[02:44.93]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[02:50.38]
[02:52.25]Tune into my heart whenever you're cold
[02:56.87]My transmission starts when you're alone
[03:00.89]I know that it's hard when things get dark
[03:06.67]
[03:08.32]Tune into my heart, tune into my heart
[03:16.19]Tune into my heart, tune into my heart
[03:24.11]Tune into my heart, tune into my heart
[03:32.14]Tune into my heart
[03:34.89]
