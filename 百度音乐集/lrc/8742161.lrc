[00:10.80]And as i look into your eyes
[00:14.38]I see an angel in disguise
[00:17.81]Sent from god above for me to love
[00:21.94]To hold and idolise
[00:25.11]And as i hold your boby near
[00:28.66]I see this month through to a year
[00:32.17]And then forever on
[00:34.42]Till life is gone
[00:36.48]I'll keep your loving near
[00:39.59]And now i finally found my way
[00:42.26]To lead me down this lonely road
[00:46.87]What i have to do
[00:48.46]Is follow you
[00:50.62]To lighten off my load
[03:02.26][02:08.49][00:53.26]You treat me like a rose
[03:06.09][02:11.98][00:56.77]You give me room to grow
[03:09.41][02:15.55][01:00.35]You shone the light of love on me
[03:12.92][02:19.20][01:03.80]You gave me air so i can breathe
[03:16.55][02:22.77][01:07.49]You open doors that close
[03:20.01][02:26.38][01:10.96]In a world where anything goes
[03:24.40][02:30.54][01:15.33]You gave me strength so i stand tall
[03:28.11][02:34.49][01:19.18]Within this bed of earth
[03:30.58][02:37.03][01:21.97]Just like a rose
[01:26.13]And when i feel like hope is gone
[01:29.50]You gave me strength to carry on
[01:33.14]Each time i look at you
[01:35.42]There's something new
[01:37.17]To keep our loving strong
[01:40.56]I hear you whisper in my ear
[01:43.94]All of the words i long to hear
[01:47.58]Of how you'll always be
[01:49.80]Here next to me
[01:51.45]To wipe away my tears
[01:54.98]And now i finally found my way
[01:57.38]To lead me down this lonely road
[02:02.20]All i have to do
[02:03.86]Is follow you
[02:05.94]To lighten off my load
[02:39.01]And through the seasons change
[02:42.04]Our love remains the same
[02:44.29](Just Like a rose)
[02:46.04]You face the thunder
[02:47.99]When the sunshine turns to rain
[02:51.63](Just like a rose)
[03:45.13]You treat me like a rose
[03:53.70]You give me strength
[03:55.31]So i stand tall
[03:57.62]Within this bed of earth
[04:00.37]Just like a rose...
