[00:01.37]Eels - Not Ready Yet
[00:23.90]there's a world outside
[00:29.75]and i know 'cause i've heard talk
[00:35.61]in my sweetest dream
[00:41.50]i would go out for a walk
[00:47.85]but i don't think i'm ready yet
[00:54.11]i'm not feeling up to it now
[00:59.96]just not that steady yet
[01:05.91]and i don't need you telling me how
[01:10.79]there's some happiness
[01:17.18]and my stone face cracks again
[01:22.47]maybe sometime sooner or later
[01:29.33]but i don't think i'm ready yet
[01:35.68]i'm not feeling up to it now
[01:41.46]just not that steady yet
[01:47.34]and i don't need you telling me how
[02:28.01]so if i leave my room
[02:34.32]don't you tell me to lighten up
[02:40.25]maybe sometime sooner or later
[02:46.59]but i don't think i'm ready yet
[02:52.76]i'm not feeling up to it now
[02:58.61]just not that steady yet
[03:04.45]and i don't need you telling me how
