[00:13.16]Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
[00:18.87]Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
[00:24.67]Still a little hard to say what's going on
[00:31.17]
[00:36.11]Still a little bit of your ghost your witness
[00:41.68]Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
[00:47.48]You step a little closer each day
[00:50.93]that I can't say what's going on
[00:53.67]
[00:58.40]Stones taught me to fly
[01:04.03]Love taught me to lie
[01:09.77]Life taught me to die
[01:14.65]So it's not hard to fall
[01:18.02]When you float like a cannonball
[01:23.05]
[01:27.51]Still a little bit of your song in my ear
[01:33.24]Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
[01:38.90]You step a little closer to me
[01:42.25]So close that I can't see what's going on
[01:45.59]
[01:49.72]Stones taught me to fly
[01:55.47]Love taught me to lie
[02:01.18]Life taught me to die
[02:06.15]Couse it's not hard to fall
[02:09.49]And I don't wana scare her
[02:12.09]It's not hard to fall
[02:15.17]And I don't wanna lose
[02:17.83]It's not hard to grow
[02:21.06]When you know that you just don't know
[02:23.99]Stones taught me to fly
[02:29.74]Love taught me to cry
[02:35.37]Life taught me to die
[02:40.37]So it's not hard to fall
[02:43.84]When you float like a cannonball
[02:46.89]Stones taught me to fly
[02:52.62]Love just taught me to cry
[02:57.49]So come on courage! Teach me to be shy
[03:03.32]Couse it's not hard to fall
[03:06.70]When you float like a cannonball
[03:13.00]
