[00:39.93]If I had to
[00:41.20]I would put myself right beside you
[00:44.15]So let me ask
[00:45.52]Would you like that?
[00:46.90]Would you like that?
[00:48.08]
[00:48.52]And I don't mind
[00:49.84]If you say this love is the last time
[00:52.84]So now I'll ask
[00:54.11]Do you like that?
[00:55.59]Do you like that?
[00:56.86]NO!!
[00:58.15]Something's getting in my way
[01:01.06]Something's just about to break
[01:03.95]I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
[01:09.74]So tell me how it should be
[01:16.09]
[01:20.06]Try to find out what makes you tick
[01:22.87]As I lie down
[01:24.53]Sore and sick
[01:25.68]Do you like that?
[01:27.18]Do you like that?
[01:28.31]
[01:28.69]There's a fine line between love and hate
[01:31.40]And I don't mind
[01:33.02]Just let me say that I like that
[01:35.85]I like that
[01:36.87]
[01:38.38]Something's getting in my way
[01:41.27]Something's just about to break
[01:44.36]I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
[01:49.89]As I burn another page
[01:52.76]As I look the other way
[01:55.70]I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
[02:01.44]So tell me how it should be
[02:07.81]
[02:18.11]Desperate, I will crawl
[02:20.70]Waiting for so long
[02:23.61]No love, there is no love
[02:29.54]Die for anyone
[02:32.26]What have I become
[02:35.68]
[02:36.20]Something's getting in the way
[02:38.74]Something's just about to break
[02:41.58]I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
[02:47.36]As I burn another page
[02:50.25]As I look the other way
[02:53.08]I still try to find my place
[02:56.03]In the diary of Jane
