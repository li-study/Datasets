[00:19.40]Here it comes
[00:21.45]Millennia
[00:22.98]And everybody's talkin' about
[00:25.60]Jerusalem
[00:27.33]Is this the beginningOr beginning of the end?
[00:31.44]Well I've got other thoughts my friends
[00:35.53]See, I've got my eyes on the skies
[00:39.76]The heavenly bodies of light
[00:43.95]And if you're in the mood to take a ride
[00:48.20]Then strap on the suit and get inside
[00:52.43]If you wanna fly
[00:55.54]Come and take a ride
[00:57.24]Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

[01:26.27]We don't need all these prophecies
[01:30.80]Telling us what's inside
[01:34.29]Cuz paranoia ain't the way
[01:36.15]To live your life from day to day
[01:38.67]So leave your doubts and your fears behind
[01:43.01]Don't be afraid at all
[01:47.14]Cuz up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
[01:50.89]Put your mind and your body to the test
[01:55.52]Cuz up in outer space is like a wild wild west
[02:00.40]If you wanna fly
[02:02.96]Come and take a ride
[02:04.54]Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

[02:54.26]No need to fear no doubts and no tears
[02:56.16]Millennium sound will motivate the future years
[02:58.39]And you've been hit to be scared
[02:59.75]Or get prepared against all odds
[03:01.27]I'll bet you never would've dared
[03:02.50]To make these moves
[03:03.52]And take flight like me
[03:04.58]To come through for the world prophecy
[03:06.86]Space connect to overthrow your interception
[03:08.88]Ready or not make it hot there ain't no question
[03:11.10]Or get in sync and put your head to the sky
[03:13.32]Keep the faith one love from Left Eye
