[00:22.66]Is this the best it gets,
[00:33.48]Before I'm laid to rest?
[00:38.31]
[00:45.01]When I am through the gates,
[00:47.59]With old acquaintances,
[00:54.43]embroidering the truth.
[00:57.32]Will stories be from pre-today
[01:03.83]or from an archive yet to make?

[01:25.59]How do I know?
[01:29.56]
[01:32.96]Disappointed, disillusioned, re-affirm my view,
[01:38.87]We've all a story to sell,
[01:43.07]We've all a lie that we tell,
[01:47.92]And it goes on and on, and on and on.
[01:54.53]
[01:55.12]Is this the best it gets?
[02:05.53]Could be surprises yet.
[02:14.02]
[02:16.60]When I become the subject of ancestors,
[02:24.57]Faded photograph, no name,
[02:28.89]A beacon or a burden,
[02:33.90]Guiding light, helpful or plain insane.

[03:16.31]We've all a lie that we tell,
[03:18.91]And it goes on and on, and on and on..
[03:26.03]Oh, disappointed, disillusioned, re-affirm my view,
[03:33.08]We've all a story to sell,
[03:39.72]We've all a lie that we tell,
[03:41.98]And it goes on and on, and on and on and on and...
[03:48.99]
[03:51.18](Disappointed, disillusioned),
[03:54.98]and on, and on, and on,
[04:01.24](Disappointed, disillusioned),
[04:06.26]and on.
