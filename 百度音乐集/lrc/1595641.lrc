[00:18.28]Shane:
[00:18.39]Looking back
[00:21.84]on the memory of
[00:25.97]the dance we shared
[00:29.23]'neath the stars above.
[00:33.14]For a moment
[00:37.06]all the world was right.
[00:40.82]How could I have known
[00:44.73]that you'd ever say goodbye
[00:48.88]Shane(All):
[00:48.98]And now
[00:50.79]I'm glad I didn't know
[00:55.20]The way it all would end
[00:58.77]the way it all would go
[01:04.04]Our lives
[01:06.11]are better left to chance
[01:10.21]I could have missed the pain.
[01:14.04]But I'd of had to miss
[01:17.45]The Dance.

[01:34.53]For a moment
[01:37.74]wasn't I a king
[01:41.88]But if I'd only known
[01:45.67]how the king would fall
[01:49.68]Hey who's to say
[01:53.28]you know I might have changed it all
[01:57.23]Shane(All):

[02:12.78]Our lives
[02:14.88]are better left to chance
