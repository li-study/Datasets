[00:22.52]Gloria, you're always on the run now
[00:28.66]Running after somebody, you gotta get him somehow
[00:35.85]I think you've got to slow down before you start to blow it

[00:46.71]So be careful not to show it
[00:50.64]You really don't remember
[00:53.79]Was it something that he said?
[00:57.40]Are the voices in your head calling
[01:01.32]Calling, Gloria?
