[00:00.49]Revolution
[00:02.34]P.O.D.
[00:04.21]
[00:08.53]More calm than a heartbeat that flat lines
[00:12.07]Quiet like a dark street under the moonlight
[00:15.43]A phrase of action that's been screamed by the guts of men,
[00:19.23]Ever since they're first experienced
[00:22.97]Injustice, prejudice, discrimination
[00:26.69]A word louder than a gunshot
[00:29.58]And softer than a baby's laugh, it will pass
[00:32.34]Just like it always has. Until it spits of the lips
[00:35.45]The next man who's had it up to here.
[00:38.87]
[00:39.32]Did somebody say a Revolution?
[00:43.20]Or is it all in my head?
[00:46.98]Is that what it takes to make a solution
[00:50.52]Your Revolution
[00:53.17]
[00:53.69]I'm not the first or the last to imagine it
[00:56.91]Acknowledge the concepts, question and grasp it
[01:00.78]Rebel against the eye and bring down the cell.
[01:04.42]Mutiny, me overthrow you
[01:06.29]Rebellion starts within, the time is now
[01:08.85]
[01:09.57]Did somebody say a Revolution?
[01:13.31]Or is it all in my head?
[01:16.91]Is that what it takes to make a solution, solution
[01:23.51]
[01:24.63]Did somebody say a Revolution?
[01:28.52]Or is it all in my head?
[01:32.22]Is that what it takes to make a solution
[01:35.94]Your Revolution
[01:44.22]
[01:56.53]Purple skies, Devil eyes, Hypnotize
[02:03.85]Little lies, Compromise, Fireflies
[02:11.46]Samurais, parasite, fly by night, after life, materialize
[02:19.08]Look alike, stereotype, do or die, lullaby, black and white
[02:27.72]
[02:29.77]Did somebody say a Revolution?
[02:33.61]Or is it all in my head?
[02:37.49]Is that what it takes to make a solution, solution
[02:43.59]
[02:44.89]Did somebody say a Revolution?
[02:48.85]Or at least it's been said
[02:52.51]Is that what it takes to make a solution?
[02:55.93]Your Revolution
[02:57.96]No resolution - Your Revolution
[02:59.45]
[03:01.57]And what's your solution? - Your Revolution
[03:05.34]And no substitution - Your Revolution
[03:09.13]And no resolution - Your Revolution
[03:12.93]And what's your solution?
