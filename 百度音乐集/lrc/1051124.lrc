[00:01.53]I Love The Way You Love Me
[00:02.24]Boyzone
[00:02.66]
[00:18.17]I like the feel of your name on my lips
[00:23.76]And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
[00:29.41]The way that your fingers run through my hair
[00:35.12]And how your scent lingers even when you're not there
[00:40.70]And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
[00:46.56]And how you enjoy your two hour bath
[00:52.15]And how you've convinced me to dance in the rain
[00:57.90]With everyone watching like we were insane
[01:02.95]But I love the way you love me
[01:14.95]Strong and wild, slow and easy
[01:20.73]Heart and soul so completely
[01:26.10]I love the way you love me
[01:34.72]
[01:38.02]And I like the sound of old R 'n' B
[01:43.64]And you roll your eyes when I'm sloppily off key
[01:49.26]And I like the innocent way that you cry
[01:54.73]At sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times
[02:00.26]But I love the way you love me
[02:12.04]Strong and wild, slow and easy
[02:17.91]Heart and soul so completely
[02:23.17]I love the way you love me
[02:30.28]
[02:32.56](Listen to me now..)
[02:34.86]And I could list a million things
[02:40.65]I love to like about you
[02:46.25]But they could all come down to one reason
[02:52.64]I could never live without you..
[02:57.50]But I love the way you love me
[03:09.21]Strong and wild, slow and easy
[03:15.27]Heart and soul so completely
[03:20.36]I love the way you love me
[03:31.70]I love the way you love me
