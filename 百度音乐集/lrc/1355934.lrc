[00:09.53]
[01:28.16]life it seems, will fade away
[01:32.34]drifting further every day
[01:36.57]getting lost within myself
[01:40.84]nothing matters no one else
[01:44.57]
[01:45.12]i have lost the will to live
[01:49.25]simply nothing more to give
[01:53.47]there is nothing more for me
[01:57.57]need the end to set me free
[02:01.20]
[02:50.43]things are not what they used to be
[02:55.05]missing one inside of me
[02:59.20]deathly lost, this cant be real
[03:03.39]cannot stand this hell i feel
[03:06.40]
[03:07.72]emptiness is filing me
[03:11.93]to the point of agony
[03:16.10]growing darkness taking dawn
[03:20.31]i was me, but now hes gone
[03:26.88]
[04:08.59]no one but me can save myself,
[04:11.85]but it to late
[04:15.51]now i cant think,
[04:17.20]think why i should even try
[04:21.63]
[04:36.48]yesterday seems as though it never existed
[04:43.35]death greets me warm,
[04:45.04]now i will just say good-bye
[04:49.69]
