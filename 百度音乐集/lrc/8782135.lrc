[00:08.15]
[00:16.43]Deep into the maze
[00:21.81]Long lost in my mind's vault
[00:28.00]
[00:32.45]Unseal the casket
[00:37.63]To save my savior
[00:43.11]
[00:43.48]I am beaten down by the beater
[00:48.79]I am cheated down by the cheater
[00:54.03]
[00:55.00]Take us home before you go
[01:01.17]My own worst enemy
[01:05.50]Take us home before you go
[01:11.81]My own worst enemy
[01:19.21]
[01:31.39]Risk some bleeding
[01:36.01]Dig out an old splinter
[01:41.59]
[01:42.00]I am beaten down by the beater
[01:47.39]I am cheated down by the cheater

[01:59.62]My own worst enemy
[02:04.01]Take us home before you go
[02:10.13]My own worst enemy
[02:14.39]
[02:14.97]I see a path ahead of me
[02:19.61]As it's the only way to go
[02:25.09]It seems so calm
[02:27.99]It seems so easy
[02:30.94]But I'm not going on this way
[02:39.55]
[02:40.84]Take us home before you go
[02:52.12]Take us home before you go
[02:58.55]My own worst enemy
