[00:10.30]我们相爱一年了呢，OH，YEAH！！我要永远和你在一起,
[00:32.62]Anyone who ever loved
[00:36.69]Could look at me and know that I love you
[00:47.32]Anyone who ever dreamed
[00:51.48]Could look at me and know I dream of you
[01:01.05]Knowing I love you, so
[01:06.58]
[01:09.61]Anyone who had a heart
[01:12.49]Would take me in his arms and love me too
[01:20.72]You couldn’t really have a heart
[01:25.35]And hurt me like you hurt me
[01:29.95]And be so untrue
[01:35.58]What am I to do?
[01:36.97]
[01:40.14]Every time you go away
[01:43.97]I always say this time it’s goodbye dear
[01:54.46]Loving you the way I do
[01:58.67]I take you back
[02:02.17]Without you I’d die dear
[02:08.74]Knowing I love you, so
[02:13.87]
[02:17.13]Anyone who had a heart
[02:20.05]Would take me in his arms and love me too
[02:28.40]You couldn’t really have a heart
[02:34.44]And hurt me like you hurt me
[02:37.12]And be so untrue
[02:42.80]What am I to do?
[02:44.89]有时想你却不敢打扰你只能默默的想念
[03:15.05]Knowing I love you, so
[03:22.81]Anyone who had a heart
[03:25.87]Would take me in his arms and love me too
[03:34.23]You couldn’t really have a heart
[03:37.26]And hurt me like you hurt me
[03:43.29]And be so untrue
[03:49.28]Anyone who had a heart could love me too
[03:55.59]Anyone who had a heart would surely take me
[04:00.35]In his arms and always love me
[04:06.74]Why won’t you? , yeah
[04:10.79]
[04:12.25]Anyone who had a heart would love me too, yeah
[04:18.71]Anyone who had a heart would simply take me
[04:23.39]In his arms and always love me
