[00:04.56]I used to wake up in the morning
[00:07.96]I used to feel so bad
[00:11.75]I got so sick of having sleepless nights
[00:15.06]I went and told my dad
[00:18.05]
[00:18.88]He said, "Son now here's some little something"
[00:22.94]And stuck them on my wall
[00:27.38]And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
[00:30.35]In fact I, I don't feel bad at all
[00:38.79]Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
[00:46.12]Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
[00:57.16]Pitcures of Lily solved my childhood problems
[01:04.45]Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright

[01:23.24]Lily, oh Lily (……⊙﹏⊙b)

[01:28.96]
[01:36.61]And then one day things weren't quite so fine
[01:40.55]I fell in love with Lily
[01:44.24]I asked my dad where Lily I could find
[01:47.48]He said, "Son, now don't be silly"
[01:52.17]"She's been dead since 1929"
[01:55.66]Oh, how I cried that night （⊙﹏⊙b）
[01:59.69]If only I'd been born in Lily's time
[02:03.48]It would have been alright
[02:07.66]
[02:08.96]Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
[02:16.36]Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
[02:24.51]
[02:27.65]For me and Lily are together in my dreams
[02:34.94]And I ask you, "Hey mister, have you ever seen"
