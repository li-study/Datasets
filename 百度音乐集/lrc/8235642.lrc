[00:07.52]If I could hold you close
[00:12.58]Like you were never gone
[00:18.71]If I could hear your voice
[00:24.36]You'd tell me to be strong
[00:26.18]
[00:27.60]But sometimes
[00:30.43]I just can't
[00:33.27]I just don't understand
[00:38.55]Why you had to go
[00:41.50]Why you had to go
[00:44.37]I guess I'll never know
[00:46.35]
[00:48.04]Ain't it funny how you think
[00:49.77]You're gonna be OK
[00:50.77]Till you remember things ain't never
[00:52.58]Gonna be the same again
[00:56.13]The same again
[00:59.35]Ain't it crazy how you think
[01:00.86]You've got your whole life planned
[01:02.22]Just to find that it was never ever
[01:04.03]In your hand
[01:06.78]In your hand
[01:10.73]Change
[01:12.42]
[01:18.39]If I could get to you
[01:23.99]I feel it in the air
[01:30.68]My world don't make no sense
[01:35.24]If I'm without you in it
[01:38.27]
[01:38.66]And sometimes
[01:41.27]I just find
[01:44.24]Can't deny
[01:46.26]Don't know why
[01:48.73]Why'd you have to go?
[01:51.63]Why'd you have to go?
[01:54.30]And leave me here alone
[01:57.66]And leave me here alone
[01:58.22]
[01:58.49]Ain't it funny how you think
[02:00.18]You're gonna be OK
[02:01.53]Till you remember things ain't never
[02:03.91]Gonna be the same again
[02:06.90]The same again
[02:10.03]Ain't it crazy how you think

[02:17.41]In your hand
[02:21.43]Change
[02:22.19]
[02:23.00]You don't see it coming
[02:27.03]Change
[02:28.79]When the future comes knocking
[02:32.24]It changed
[02:34.33]It can make you or break you too
[02:38.76]You'd just have to make it through
[02:41.41](You'd just have to make it through)
[02:42.26]
[02:43.94]Ain't it funny how you think
[02:45.74]You're gonna be OK
[02:46.65]Till you remember things ain't never
[02:48.49]Gonna be the same again
[02:52.12]The same again
