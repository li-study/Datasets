[ti:]Times Like These

[al:]On And On

[00:17.30]In times like these
[00:20.18]In times like those
[00:23.36]What will be will be
[00:26.84]And so it goes
[00:30.23]And it always goes on and on...
[00:34.95]On and on it goes
[00:50.54]And there has always been laughing, crying, birth, and dying
[00:55.34]Boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
[00:58.32]And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
[01:02.80]But then hurt from time to times like these
[01:07.64]And times like those
[01:10.43]And what will be will be
[01:13.98]And so it goes
[01:17.24]And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
[01:21.61]Action,Reaction, sticks and stones and broken bones
[01:25.25]Those for peace and those for war
[01:28.04]And god bless these ones, not those ones
[01:30.44]But these ones made times like these
[01:35.09]And times like those
[01:37.54]What will be will be
[01:40.83]And so it goes
[01:44.18]And it always goes on and on...
[01:52.18]On and on it goes
[02:04.16]But somehow I know it won't be the same
[02:11.06]Somehow I know it will never be the same.
