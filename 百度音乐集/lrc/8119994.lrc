[00:08.00]Third Eye Blind
[00:10.00]Semi-Charmed Life
[00:19.00]I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling,
[00:21.00]She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
[00:23.00]She says she lives for me
[00:25.00]Ovation, She's got her own motivation
[00:27.00]She comes round and she goes down on me
[00:29.00]And I make her smile like a drug for you
[00:32.00]Do ever what you want to do
[00:33.00]Coming over you
[00:35.00]Keep on smiling what we go through
[00:36.00]One stop to the rhythm that divides you
[00:39.00]And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
[00:41.00]Chop another line like a coda with a curse
[00:44.00]And I come on like a freak show takes the stage
[00:46.00]We give them the games we play, she said
[00:48.00]I want something else
[00:51.00]To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life Baby, Baby
[00:57.00]I want something else, I'm not listening when you say
[01:04.00]Good-bye.
[01:07.00]Do-do-do do-do-do-doodoo-do-do-do do...
[01:15.00]The sky was gold, it was rose
[01:17.00]I was taking sips of it through it my nose
[01:19.00]And I wish it could get back there
[01:20.00]Some place back there
[01:22.00]Smiling in the pictures you would take
[01:23.00]Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
[01:25.00]It won't stop, I won't come down
[01:27.00]I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop
[01:30.00]And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
[01:32.00]Then I bumped again, And then I bumped again,
[01:35.00]How do I get back there
[01:37.00]To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
[01:40.00]How do I get myself back to the place
[01:42.00]The place where you said
[01:44.00]I want something else to get me through this semi-charmed kind of life
[01:54.00]I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye
[02:04.00]I believe in the sand beneath my toes
[02:06.00]The beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling
[02:09.00]I believe in the faith that grows
[02:11.00]And the four right chords can make me cry
[02:15.00]When I'm with you I feel like I could die
[02:18.00]And that would be all right, all right
[02:21.00]When the plane came in she said she was crashing
[02:25.00]The velvet it rips in the city
[02:27.00]We tripped on the urge to feel alive
[02:29.00]But now I'm struggling to survive
[02:31.00]The days you were wearing that velvet dress
[02:34.00]You're the priestess I must confess
[02:36.00]Those little red panties they pass the test
[02:39.00]Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress
[02:41.00]One
[02:43.00]Now you hold me
[02:45.00]And we are broken
[02:48.00]Still it's all that I want to do
[02:50.00](Just a little now)
[02:51.00]Feel myself with a head made of the ground
[02:53.00]I'm scared I'm not coming down
[02:59.00]And I won't run for my life
[03:02.00]She's got her jaws just locked now in a smile
[03:05.00]But nothing is all right, all right
[03:09.00]And I want something else to get me through this life Baby, Baby
[03:19.00]And I want something else, I'm not listening when you say
[03:26.00]Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye...
[03:47.00]Do-do-do-doodoo-do-do-do...
