[00:26.43]Take a short walk in my shoes

[00:39.37]I am unbreakable, I'm Rock, I am never weak now
[00:42.19]I feel weak sometimes, but you'll never see
[00:44.45]I'm going through one of the roughest times in my entire life right now
[00:48.15]Still I got a slight smile
[00:49.63]I'm knowin' it's gonna be better days, like Tupac said
[00:51.96]And we go make it like Eve & them two LOX said
[00:54.46]Whos not fed up with something
[00:56.79]Life's about struggling and overcoming your shortcomings
[00:58.69]Not about huffing and puffing and crying without doing nothing
[01:02.65]Take them sour lemons, make lemonade, and stop playing

[01:26.14]See, I'm Rock like coal is, old and dusty
[01:29.34]But, y'all already know what's underneath
[01:31.46]Give me some time, and keep applying pressure
[01:33.26]Watch me shine like the ex-BadBoy
[01:35.03]It'll all be fine (all be fine)
[01:36.47]Just dig down deep, search for that energy
[01:39.06]I can't lose, get in touch with that inner energy
[01:41.61]Game face on, see this mug, you'll remember me
[01:44.22]Focus out the pain, ignore any injury
[01:46.83]Then again, I am Rock, can't really injure me
[01:49.40]Chip off a piece, all you're gonna get is a little me
[01:51.93]Got one from almost every tough time in my history
[01:54.51]Hence the new team, ROCK BROVAAAAAAZ, are you still with me?
[01:57.21]Got a bunch more, they're in my last stage of misery
[01:59.77]My little Gz, that's strength in me, are you kidding me?
[02:02.30]I get stronger every time they try to finish me
[02:04.93]We don't die, we multiply, can I get a witness, please?

[02:25.09]I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock
[02:28.58]Sure there've been times I feel I can't go on
[02:30.89]But I am so strong, I really can't go wrong
[02:33.56]I am stayin' so long, I ain't goin' home
[02:36.14]Rock Man goin' hard, 'til I can't no more
[02:38.90]Tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth, me and bad luck
[02:42.37]Did have beef, he can't hurt me, he can't serve me
[02:45.64]I win every time I see him, even with all his undermining G-in'
[02:48.16]Every time I beat him I think the odds must be his crew (huh?)
[02:52.29]Word, they've always been against me, too (huh?)
[02:54.81]They can't see me neither, anyone thinking he could, keep me out my championship, he fooled
