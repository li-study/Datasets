[00:14.00]everywhere i look i see her smile
[00:19.00]her absent minded eyes
[00:25.00]and she has kept me wondering for so long
[00:30.00]how this thing could go wrong
[00:34.00]it seems to me that we are both the same
[00:39.00]playing the same game
[00:44.00]but as darkness falls this true love falls apart
[00:50.00]into a riddle of her heart
[00:55.00][03:18.00]she's so vulnerable like china in my hands
[01:01.00]she's so vulnerable and i don't understand
[01:09.00][03:10.00]i could never hurt the one i love
[01:14.00][02:24.00][03:14.00][03:35.00]she's all i've got
[01:16.00][03:16.00][03:23.00][03:37.00]but she's so vulnerable
[01:20.00][02:14.00][02:30.00][03:04.00][03:25.00][03:41.00]oh so vulnerable
[01:24.00]days like these no one should be alone
[01:29.00]no heart should hide away
[01:35.00]her touch is gently conquering my mind
[01:40.00]there's nothing words can say
[01:44.00]she's coloured all the secrets of my soul
[01:49.00]i've whispered all my dreams
[01:54.00]but just as night-time falls this vision falls apart
[01:59.00]into a riddle of her heart yea
[02:04.00][02:07.00][02:11.00][02:26.00][02:55.00][02:57.00][03:02.00][03:48.00][03:56.00]she's so vulnerable
[02:09.00][02:59.00]like china in my hands
[02:16.00][03:06.00][03:28.00]and i don't understand
[02:19.00][03:30.00]i could never hurt someone i love
[02:34.00]don't hide your eyes...
[03:52.00]my baby she's so vulnerable
