[01:09]I am a man who walks alone
[01:12]And when I'm walking a dark road
[01:16]At night or strolling through the park
[01:22]When the light begins to change
[01:26]I sometimes feel a little strange
[01:29]A little anxious when it's dark
[03:19][03:11][02:44][02:35][01:33]Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
[03:15][02:39][01:40]I have a constant fear that something's always near
[01:46]Fear of the dark
[01:48]you!
[01:49](fear of the dark)
[01:51]yeees
[03:23][02:48][01:53]I have a phobia that someone's always there
[02:18]Have you run your fingers down the wall
[02:21]And have you felt your neck skin crawl
[02:23]When you're searching for the light?
[02:26]Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
[02:29]At the corner of the room
[02:32]You've sensed that something's watching you
[02:54]Have you ever been alone at night
[02:56]Thought you heard footsteps behind
[02:59]And turned around and no-one's there?
[03:03]And as you quicken up your pace
[03:05]You find it hard to look again
[03:07]Because you're sure there's someone there
[05:03]Fear of the dark
[05:07]Fear of the dark
[05:11]Fear of the dark
[05:14]Fear of the dark
[05:17]Sing it else again
[05:18](Fear of the dark)
[05:20]wow
[05:22](Fear of the dark)
[05:24]One more
[05:26](Fear of the dark)
[05:29]Fear of the dark
[05:51]Watching horror films the night before
[05:53]Debating witches and folklore
[05:55]The unknown troubles on your mind
[06:00]I know your mind is playing tricks
[06:03]You sense, and suddenly eyes fix on dancing shadows from behind
[06:24][06:08]Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
[06:28][06:12]I have a constant fear that something's always near
[06:32][06:16]Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
[06:36][06:20]I have a phobia that someone's always there
[06:59]When I'm walking a dark road
[07:03]I am am man who walks alone...
