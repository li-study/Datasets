[00:02.59]Shayne Ward - Breathless
[00:06.96]
[00:09.29]If our love was a fairy tale
[00:12.99]I would charge in and rescue you
[00:16.81]On a yacht baby we would sail
[00:20.56]To an island where we’d say I do
[00:24.37]And if we had babies they would look like you
[00:28.27]It’d be so beautiful if that came true
[00:32.12]You don’t even know how very special you are
[00:36.98]Chorus
[00:38.01]You leave me breathless
[00:42.58]You’re everything good in my life
[00:45.59]You leave me breathless
[00:50.27]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[00:53.56]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[00:57.63]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[01:01.99]Breathless
[01:06.76]And if our love was a story book
[01:10.58]We would meet on the very first page
[01:14.48]The last chapter would be about
[01:18.20]How I’m thankful for the life we’ve made
[01:22.06]And if we had babies they would have your eyes
[01:26.06]I would fall deeper watching you give life
[01:29.82]You don’t even know how very special you are
[01:35.51]You’re everything good in my life
[01:43.20]You leave me breathless
[01:47.92]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[01:51.03]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[01:55.27]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[01:59.99]You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
[02:05.55]You’re like an angel
[02:08.20]The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
[02:13.12]You’re something special
[02:15.34]I only hope that I’ll one day deserve what you’ve given me
[02:20.60]But all I can do is try
[02:24.97]Every day of my life
[02:33.39]You leave me breathless
[02:37.92]You’re everything good in my life
[02:40.86]You leave me breathless
[02:45.59]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[02:48.67]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[02:52.95]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[02:57.31]Breathless
[02:59.48]You leave me breathless
[03:00.98]You’re everything good in my life
[03:04.00]You leave me breathless
[03:08.78]I still can’t believe that you’re mine
[03:11.71]You just walked out of one of my dreams
[03:16.07]So beautiful you’re leaving me
[03:20.61]Breathless
