[00:22.51]You are the flame in my heart
[00:25.36]You light my way in the dark
[00:28.15]You are the ultimate star
[00:30.87]
[00:33.32]You lift me up from above
[00:36.40]Your unconditional love takes me to paradise
[00:42.57]
[03:30.64][03:07.57][00:44.24]I belong to you
[03:11.03][00:48.08]And you
[03:12.65][00:49.70]You belong to me too
[00:52.95]
[00:55.23]You make my life complete
[00:59.61]You make me feel so sweet
[01:02.63]
[01:18.09]You make me feel so divine
[01:20.39]Your soul and mind are entwined
[01:23.16]Before you I was blind
[01:26.38]
[01:28.33]But since I’ve opened my eyes
[01:31.36]And with you there’s no disguise
[01:34.19]So I could open up my mind
[01:37.07]
[01:38.78]I always loved you from the start
[01:41.18]But I could not figure out
[01:44.17]That I had to do it everyday
[01:49.63]So I put away the fight
[01:52.36]Now I’m gonna live my life
[01:55.02]Giving you the most in every way
[01:59.84]
[03:28.35][02:22.51][02:00.53]Ooo I belong to you
[03:33.79][03:32.81][02:27.37][02:05.12]And you
[03:34.78][02:28.43][02:06.14]You belong to me too
[03:41.98][03:40.17][03:20.40][03:18.16][02:33.57][02:12.20]You make my life complete
[03:44.20][03:22.41][02:38.20][02:16.52]You make me feel so sweet
[03:53.90][03:51.48][03:47.55][02:41.13][02:21.34]
