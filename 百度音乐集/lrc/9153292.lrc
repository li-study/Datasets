[00:00.00]Sideways (blue & soul)--Santana     by  Two Gods
[00:15.00]
[00:18.50]You know it isn’t easy
[00:22.50]For these thoughts here to leave me
[00:26.50]There are no words to describe it
[00:31.50]In French or in English
[00:36.00]Cause diamonds they fade
[00:40.50]And flowers they bloom
[00:45.00]And I’m telling you
[00:47.00][01:22.00][01:27.50][01:36.00][02:13.00][02:47.00]
[00:49.50][01:33.00][02:15.50][02:15.50][03:56.00]These feelings won’t go away
[00:54.50][02:19.50][04:00.50]They’ve been knockin me sideways
[00:58.50][02:24.00][04:04.50]They’ve been knockin me out lately
[01:02.50][02:28.00][04:08.50]Whenever you come around me
[01:07.00][02:32.50][02:49.00][04:12.50]These feelings won’t go away
[01:11.00][02:36.50][02:53.00][04:16.50]They’ve been knockin me sideways
[01:15.50][02:40.50][02:57.50][04:20.50]I keep thinking in a moment that
[01:19.50][02:44.00][03:01.00][04:24.50]Time will take them away
[01:24.00]But these feelings won’t go away
[03:05.50][03:14.50]These feelings won’t go away
[01:45.00]it isn’t easy
[01:49.00]For these thoughts here to leave me
[01:53.00]And no words to describe it
[01:57.50]In french or in english
[02:02.00][03:22.00][03:39.00]Cause diamonds they fade
[02:06.50][03:26.50][03:43.50]flowers they bloom
[02:10.00][03:30.50][03:35.00][03:47.00][03:51.50]I’m telling you
[04:27.50]......:)
