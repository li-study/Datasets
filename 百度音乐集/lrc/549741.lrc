[00:07.73]
[00:11.00]I've been thinkin' 'bout us
[00:13.49](and the things we've been through)
[00:15.81]It's time we get serious
[00:19.23](you know I would like to)
[00:20.77]But we need to work out these issues
[00:25.94]Before they get out of hand
[00:29.34]
[00:30.09](oh Yeah) Oh yeah~
[00:33.11]I know we've been fussing and arguing
[00:39.61]But the fact is unity is a good thing
[00:44.17]It took a while for me but now I see
[00:49.39]Though some will love you, that same will hate you
[00:54.01]Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
[00:56.82]Just try to chill and ride it out
[00:59.50]But it's official when I'm against you
[01:04.00]Whether it's wrong or it's right
[01:06.90]I would rather be by your side (x4)
[01:25.06]
[01:25.44]I've been lookin' at our history
[01:30.05]Things ain't changin' but they need to be
[01:34.87]Where do we start
[01:37.60]Seems like it's gone too far
[01:40.02]Can't we just try to work it out
[01:44.62]
[01:45.05](oh yeah) Oh yeah
[01:47.07]I know we've been fussing and arguing
[01:53.68]But the truth is unity is a good thing
[01:58.65]It took some time for me but now I see
[02:03.36]Though some will love you, that same will hate you
[02:08.24]Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
[02:10.78]So try to chill and ride it out
[02:13.69]But it's official when I'm against you
[02:18.41]Whether it's wrong or it's right
[02:21.48]I would rather be by your side (x4)
[02:39.57]
[02:39.90]I'm so sorry I treated you so bad (so bad)
[02:44.24]But I did realize what a friend I had (oh no)
[02:49.14]I regret the things I did and you can't believe that
[02:54.56]I apologize
[02:56.50]Wish I could take it back
[02:57.91]
[02:58.32]Though some will love you (kiley:sometimes I loved you), that same will hate you
[03:03.00]Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
[03:05.49]So try to chill and ride it out
[03:07.82]But it's official when I'm against you (oh)
[03:12.69]Whether it's wrong or it's right
[03:15.49]I would rather be by your side
[03:20.34]I would rather be by your side (by your side, yeah)
[03:25.24]I would rather be by your side (by your side)
[03:30.31]I would rather be by your side (side)
[03:35.54]I would rather be by your side (oh)
[03:40.22]I would rather be by your side (oooh)
