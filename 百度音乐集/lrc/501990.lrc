[00:05.00]Damien Rice - The Animals Were Gone
[00:10.00]
[00:29.06]Woke up and for the first time
[00:32.13]the animals were gone
[00:34.35]It's left this house empty now
[00:38.32]not sure if I belong
[00:41.98]Yesterday you asked me
[00:45.82]to write you a pleasant song
[00:49.39]I'll do my best now
[00:54.88]but you've been gone for so long
[00:58.08]The window's open now
[01:00.00]and the winter settles in
[01:02.69]We'll call it Christmas
[01:06.69]when the adverts begin
[01:10.28]I love your depression
[01:13.72]and I love your double chin
[01:16.91]I love 'most everything
[01:21.47]that you bring to this offering
[01:24.69]Oh I know that I left you
[01:30.91]in places of despair
[01:38.95]Oh I know that I love you
[01:45.82]so please throw down your hair
[01:51.70]At night I trip without you
[02:00.42]and hope I don't wake up
[02:04.46]'Cause waking up without you
[02:13.69]is like drinking from an empty cup
[02:19.16]Woke up and for the first time
[02:23.54]the animals were gone
[02:27.01]Our clocks are ticking now
[02:30.98]so before our time is gone
[02:34.86]We could get a house
[02:37.14]and some boxes on the lawn
[02:40.93]We could make babies
[02:44.34]and accidental songs
[02:47.61]I know I've been a liar
[02:51.74]and I know I've been a fool
[02:54.70]I hope we didn't break yet
[02:57.46]but I'm glad we broke the rules
[03:01.96]My cave is deep now
[03:04.74]yet your light is shining through
[03:08.43]I cover my eyes, still all I see is you
[03:15.77]Oh I know that I left you
[03:22.62]in places of despair
[03:28.97]Oh I know that I love you
[03:37.23]so please throw down your hair
[03:44.48]At night I trip without you
[03:50.45]and hope I don't wake up
[03:56.89]'Cause waking up without you is
[04:05.33]like drinking from an empty cup
[04:11.71]
