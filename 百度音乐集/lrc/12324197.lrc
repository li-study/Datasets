[00:00.00]The wind blew a path through the fallen leaves
[00:09.43]And there showed a crack in the old oak tree
[00:18.70]The door stood as if it was standing guard
[00:27.54]Of the dozen chipmunks in the backyard
[02:40.13][00:36.75]Every house not a home but dare do I roam
[02:48.61][00:44.98]There's a light on the porch here for someone
[00:53.69]Once upon a time in a border town
[01:02.76]The war was over, the guns laid down
[01:12.09]The women, the men, the children saved
[01:21.44]Now it's hard to remember it any other way
[01:30.55]When the law acts as though there is nothing to show
[01:38.39]There is compassion and depth in a neighbor
[02:57.40][01:46.97]Now if Bartles & Jaymes didn't need no first names
[03:05.46][01:55.15]We could live by our own laws in favor
