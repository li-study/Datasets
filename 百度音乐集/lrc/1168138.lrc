[00:02.86]The River
[00:07.59]by Bruce Springsteen
[00:11.65]
[00:16.95]I come from down in valley
[00:21.11]where mister when you're young
[00:25.18]they bring you up to do
[00:29.60]like your daddy done
[00:33.50]Me and Mary we met in high school
[00:37.72]when she was just seventeen
[00:41.73]we'd drive out of this valley
[00:46.11]down to where the fields were green
[00:50.54]
[00:51.07]We'd go down to the river
[00:55.86]and into the river we'd dive
[00:59.68]Oh~down to the river we'd ride
[01:08.62]Then I got Mary pregnant
[01:12.62]and man that was all she wrote
[01:16.78]and for my nineteenth birthday
[01:19.95]I got a union card and a wedding coat
[01:24.86]we went down to the courthouse
[01:28.94]and the judge put it all to rest
[01:32.87]no wedding day smiles
[01:35.21]no walk down the aisle
[01:37.35]no flowers
[01:38.53]no wedding dress
[01:40.00]
[01:40.43]That night we went down to the river
[01:45.14]and into the river we'd dive
[01:48.77]Oh~down to the river we'd ride
[01:58.65]

[02:32.69]I got a job working constrction
[02:36.45]for the johnstown company
[02:41.03]but lately there ain't been much work
[02:44.56]on account of the economy
[02:48.83]Now all them things that seemed so important
[02:52.84]well mister they vanished right into the air
[02:56.75]now I just act like I don't remember
[03:00.75]Mary acts like she don't care
[03:04.97]But I remember us riding in my brother's car
[03:09.11]Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
[03:13.62]at night on them banks I'd lie awake
[03:17.14]and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
[03:21.31]Now those memories come back to haunt me
[03:25.67]They haunt me like a curse
[03:29.65]is a dream a lie if it don't come true
[03:33.95]or is it something worse
[03:36.80]
[03:37.13]that sends me down to the river
[03:41.77]though I know the river is dry
[03:45.47]that sends me down to the river
[03:49.94]tonight
[03:54.66]Down to the river
[03:58.18]My baby and I
[04:01.84]Oh down to~ the river we ride
[04:12.50]Woo...
