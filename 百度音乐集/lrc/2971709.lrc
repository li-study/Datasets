[00:29.24]Here we are stuck by this river
[00:36.18]You and I underneath a sky
[00:41.59]That's ever falling down down down
[00:49.30]Ever falling down
[00:57.75]Through the day as if on an ocean
[01:05.12]Waiting here always failing to remember
[01:11.27]Why we came came came
[01:17.40]I wonder why we came
[01:20.46]music:
[01:55.35]You talk to me as if from a distance
[02:02.15]And I reply with impressions chosen
[02:08.41]From another time time time
[02:15.11]From another time.
