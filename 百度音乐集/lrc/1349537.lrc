[00:12.25]I couldn\'t wait to turn sixteen
[00:15.14]and drive all the boys around
[00:17.61]Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
[00:19.84]was all i could think about
[00:21.86]
[00:23.06]A little rust in the bed of that truck
[00:25.23]and a four speed on the floor
[00:28.15]Five hundred dollars
[00:29.49]it was mine all mine
[00:31.14]and i never wanted nothing more

[00:41.26]with a six dollar bottle of wine
[00:44.54]Just a fool tryin to play it cool
[00:46.42]hopin she\'d let me cross the line
[00:47.93]
[00:49.87]and I was prayin that she couldn\'t tell
