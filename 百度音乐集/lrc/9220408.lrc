[00:36.00]I feel like dying
[00:38.00]everyday
[00:39.00]Am I here
[00:40.00]just to fade away?
[00:41.50]Do you know
[00:42.00]what it means?
[00:45.00]You can think it's OK
[00:47.50]but the story is not
[00:48.80]the same anymore
[00:50.00]
[00:52.90]Drop me and let me fall
[00:56.70]in a way
[00:59.00]I haven't felt before
[01:01.50]Leave me alone
[01:03.80]don't come any closer
[01:06.10]I'm so alone
[01:08.50]and I think I'm a loser
[01:10.00]
[01:21.30]Nobody never
[01:22.88]understands
[01:23.80]Now I'm a lone
[01:25.00]and on my own
[01:27.00]It's so unfair
[01:30.00]people cry, people smile
[01:32.50]Is it wrong or is it right?
[01:35.00]I know it's right
[01:37.00]
[01:38.80]Drop me and let me fall
[01:42.70]in a way
[01:45.00]I haven't felt before
[01:47.50]Leave me alone
[01:49.80]don't come any closer
[01:51.10]I'm so alone
[01:52.80]and I think I'm a loser
[01:58.20]
[02:32.10]Drop me and let me fall
[02:35.40]in a way
[02:38.80]I haven't felt before
[02:41.10]Leave me alone
[02:43.40]don't come any closer
[02:45.80]I'm so alone
[02:47.40]and I think I'm a loser
