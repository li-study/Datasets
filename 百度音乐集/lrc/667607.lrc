[00:08.80]
[00:21.80]Every night I find it's so hard to sleep
[00:25.93]Cause I keep thinking of you
[00:28.84]And these feelings run deep
[00:31.24]Oh baby Itry to hide
[00:33.84]All these feelings for you
[00:36.57]I keep them battled inside
[00:39.28]I don't know what else to do
[00:41.81]So I cry and nobody hears me
[00:47.85]I cry,it's my only solution
[00:52.79]I cry,to all this confusion
[00:58.23]I cry, with all of my heart
[01:03.91]I cry
[01:08.36]
[01:14.84]Sometimes I wonder
[01:17.03]In the blink of my eye
[01:19.28]Would you be willing to love me
[01:22.08]Would you give it a try
[01:24.55]I don't know how else to show you
[01:27.91]That our love could be real
[01:30.38]I'd be eternally faithfull
[01:33.29]Forever I'd feel
[01:35.28]So I cry and nobody hears me
[01:40.82]I cry,it's my only solution
[01:46.20]I cry,to all this confusion
[01:51.54]I cry, with all of my heart
[01:57.20]I cry
[02:00.35]
[02:08.31]No one can tell me that I may be wrong
[02:12.97]Cause I know in my heart
[02:15.37]This feeling's still burning strong
[02:17.80]Can't get you out of my head
[02:20.50]Can't get you out of my heart
[02:23.35]Can't get you out of my life
[02:25.93]No matter if we're apart
[02:28.57]So I cry and nobody hears me
[02:34.31]I cry,it's my only solution
[02:39.63]I cry,to all this confusion
[02:44.84]I cry, with all of my heart
[02:50.23]I cry
[02:53.57]And nobody hears me
[02:55.71]I cry,it's my only solution
[03:00.88]I cry,to all this confusion
[03:06.32]I cry, with all of my heart
[03:12.24]I cry
[03:15.02]
