[00:04.39]Stop This Train Lyrics
[00:08.05]Richard Cheng in Sun Yat-sen Univeristy
[00:17.29]
[00:22.06]No, I'm not colorblind
[00:25.15]I know the world is black and white
[00:32.75]Try to keep an open mind
[00:36.29]just can't sleep on this tonight
[00:43.36]Stop this train
[00:46.07]I wanna get off and go home again
[00:51.37]I can't take the speed it's movin' in
[00:56.77]I know I can't
[00:59.66]But honestly
[01:02.07]won't someone stop this train
[01:05.75]
[01:15.62]Don't know how else to say it
[01:18.62]don't wanna see my parents go
[01:26.43]One generation's left for me
[01:29.66]for findin' life out on my own
[01:37.13]
[01:37.40]Stop this train
[01:39.68]I wanna get off and go home again
[01:44.90]I can't take the speed it's movin' in
[01:50.16]I know I can't
[01:52.94]But honestly
[01:55.19]won't someone stop this train
[01:59.58]
[02:30.94]So green at gettin' older
[02:34.02]I'm only good at being young
[02:41.37]So I play the numbers game
[02:43.99]to find a way to say that
[02:46.09]life has just begun
[02:48.77]
[02:52.40]Had a talk with my old man
[02:55.15]said help me understand
[02:58.08]He said since 68
[03:00.28]you renegotiate
[03:02.57]Don't stop this train
[03:05.46]Don't fall in bed and lose the place you're in
[03:10.66]Don't think I couldn't ever understand
[03:16.15]I tried my hand
[03:18.60]John , honestly
[03:21.27]we'll never stop this train
[03:24.81]
[03:34.94]Once in awhile when it's good
[03:38.67]it'll feel like it should
[03:41.66]And they're all still around
[03:44.10]and you're still safe and sound
[03:47.02]And you don't miss a thing
[03:49.26]so you cry as you're driving
[03:51.71]away in the dark
[03:55.96]just singing
[03:56.88]
[03:57.46]Stop this train
[03:59.18]I wanna get off and go home again
[04:04.46]I can't take the speed
[04:06.66]it's movin' in
[04:09.87]I know I can't
[04:12.53]'cuz now I see
[04:14.88]I'll never stop this train
[04:17.56]
