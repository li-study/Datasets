[00:02.00]You Will Be Mine
[00:03.58]Lenka
[00:05.57]
[00:08.30]She moved in to the house next door
[00:11.62]Said she'd never been in love before
[00:15.72]Tried the best she could to hide herself away
[00:20.84]
[00:23.46]But every time she turned the lights down low
[00:27.37]He thought he heard a voice calling out so slow
[00:31.31]Come and take me away from all this pain
[00:36.33]And he said
[00:39.37]
[00:41.45]I see you sitting there at the window sill
[00:45.05]Looking for shooting stars
[00:48.15]
[00:48.95]I wanna get closer and closer still
[00:52.84]I wanna take over your heart
[00:56.10]You will be mine, mine
[00:59.62]Over time, time
[01:04.35]You're gonna find, find
[01:07.56]I'll make you mine, mine
[01:10.61]
[01:13.47]Every morning when she came outside
[01:17.28]He tried to be the one to catch her eye
[01:21.58]But she would only turn away and hide
[01:26.98]
[01:29.22]He started to concoct a plan
[01:32.31]To get her to return the feelings that he had
[01:36.22]To show her how he thought they were entwined
[01:42.55]
[01:44.21]I see you sitting there at the window sill
[01:48.04]Looking for shooting stars
[01:51.54]I wanna get closer and closer still
[01:55.87]I wanna take over your heart
[01:59.16]You will be mine, mine
[02:02.64]Over time, time
[02:06.32]You're gonna find, find
[02:10.22]I'll make you mine, mine
[02:13.74]
[02:15.89]Little love letters written in red
[02:19.38]Folded up, put away next to the bed, oh
[02:24.40]Little crushed hopes every day
[02:27.66]Waiting in the wings to spirit her away
[02:31.44]
[02:35.31]I see you sitting there at the window sill
[02:39.15]Looking for shooting stars
[02:42.81]I wanna get closer and closer still
[02:46.97]I wanna take over your heart
[02:50.25]You will be mine mine
[02:53.58]Over time time
[02:57.53]You're gonna find find
[03:01.61]I'll make you mine mine
[03:05.33]You will be mine mine
[03:09.59]Over time time
[03:13.62]You're gonna find find
[03:17.41]I'll make you mine
[03:20.94]
