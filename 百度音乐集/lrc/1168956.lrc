[00:20.71]
[00:35.71]He took advantage of your love
[00:39.26]And he threw it all away
[00:44.58]He broke your tender heart
[00:47.49]Words can't express what you wanna say
[00:52.45]But deep inside you know
[00:55.07]That there's someone out there for you
[01:01.42]Who'll love you tenderly
[01:04.39]And turn your dark skies into blue
[01:06.86]So tell me girl
[01:09.96]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl?
[01:18.70]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
[01:27.00]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl
[01:35.73]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
[01:43.98]I know it's hard to start again
[01:47.89]To find somebody new
[01:52.05]But don't you be afraid
[01:55.90]Rough times don't last but true lovers do
[02:01.50]As the night follows the day
[02:04.75]Some you win and some you lose
[02:09.20]But don't give up on love
[02:11.91]Sometimes you clear the old to get to the new
[02:18.32]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl?
[02:26.91]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
[02:34.80]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl
[02:43.91]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
[02:52.20]Let me dry your eyes
[02:56.76]I am here for you
[03:01.07]You are not alone
[03:05.39]I know what you're going through
[03:12.78]So sad
[03:15.11]Baby girl, oh, baby girl
[03:20.39]Wipe your tears away
[03:27.00]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl?
[03:35.33]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
[03:43.82]Why do you look so sad, baby girl, baby girl
[03:52.50]It couldn't be so bad, baby girl, baby girl
