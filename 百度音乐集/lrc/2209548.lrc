[00:00.00]Switchfoot - Meant To Live
[00:17.66]
[00:19.66]Fumbling his confidence
[00:22.42]And wond'ring why the world has passed him by
[00:32.47]Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments,
[00:36.68]And failed attempts to fly, fly
[00:44.35]
[00:45.06]We were meant to live for so much more
[00:49.60]Have we lost ourselves?
[00:51.48]Somewhere we live inside
[00:54.61]Somewhere we live inside
[00:57.81]We were meant to live for so much more
[01:02.17]Have we lost ourselves?
[01:04.22]Somewhere we live inside
[01:07.76]
[01:13.85]Dreaming about Providence
[01:16.48]And whether mice or men have second tries
[01:26.44]Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open
[01:30.13]Maybe we're bent and broken, broken
[01:36.87]
[01:39.19]We were meant to live for so much more
[01:43.67]Have we lost ourselves?
[01:45.50]Somewhere we live inside
[01:48.77]Somewhere we live inside
[01:51.92]We were meant to live for so much more
[01:56.21]Have we lost ourselves?
[01:58.21]Somewhere we live inside
[02:02.07]
[02:13.35]We want more than this world's got to offer
[02:19.32]We want more than this world's got to offer
[02:25.75]We want more than the wars of our fathers
[02:31.57]And everything inside screams for second life
[02:37.96]
[02:39.80]We were meant to live for so much more
[02:43.91]Have we lost ourselves?
[02:45.91]We were meant to live for so much more
[02:50.27]Have we lost ourselves?
[02:52.46]We were meant to live for so much more
[02:56.61]Have we lost ourselves?
[02:58.65]We were meant to live
[03:01.88]We were meant to live
[03:05.58]
