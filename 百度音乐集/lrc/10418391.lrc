[00:01.26]Standing on the waters casting your bread
[00:04.41]While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
[00:12.90]Distant ships sailing into the mist,
[00:15.42]You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
[00:23.26]Freedom just around the corner for you
[00:27.94]But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
[00:35.38]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[00:40.76]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[00:43.55]Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
[00:51.90]So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
[00:54.75]You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
[01:00.65]Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
[01:05.73]Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one.
[01:13.42]Shedding off one more layer of skin,
[01:19.92]Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.
[01:26.61]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[01:30.76]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[01:33.89]Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
[01:41.49]You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
[01:44.62]Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.
[01:50.33]You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
[01:53.91]But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.
[02:02.96]Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
[02:08.88]You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
[02:17.04]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[02:20.12]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[02:23.63]Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
[02:32.15]Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
[02:41.53]Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
[02:43.75]The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
[02:52.14]In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,
[02:56.42]Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
[03:03.40]Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
[03:09.88]Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.
[03:17.36]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[03:22.36]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[03:24.83]Oh. oh. oh. Jokerman.
[03:41.70]Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
[03:45.18]Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.
[03:52.87]Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
[03:55.94]Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,
[04:03.31]False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
[04:09.97]Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.
[04:17.30]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[04:20.21]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[04:24.09]Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
[04:42.00]It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
[04:45.12]A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
[04:52.44]He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
[04:56.06]Take the motherless children off the street
[04:58.79]And place them at the feet of a harlot.
[05:03.92]Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
[05:10.47]Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
[05:18.00]Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
[05:20.68]Bird fly high by the light of the moon,
[05:24.00]Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
