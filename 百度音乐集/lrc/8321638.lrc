[00:49.55]Mmm
[00:56.45]If the fish swam out of the ocean
[00:59.87]And grew legs and they started walking
[01:03.54]And the apes climbed down from the trees
[01:06.88]And grew tall and they started talking
[01:10.44]And the stars fell out of the sky
[01:14.11]And my tears rolled into the ocean
[01:17.41]And now I’m looking for a reason why
[01:20.94]You even set my world into motion
[01:24.02]
[01:24.69]Coz if you’re not really here
[01:27.99]Then the stars don’t even matter
[01:31.46]Now I’m filled to the top with fear
[01:35.01]That it’s all just a bunch of matter
[01:38.56]Coz if you’re not really here
[01:42.25]Then I don’t wanna be either
[01:45.29]I wanna be next to you
[01:48.75]Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
[01:53.64]
[02:08.01]I look up into the night sky
[02:11.13]I see a thousand eyes staring back
[02:14.81]And all around these golden beacons
[02:18.27]I see nothing but black
[02:21.84]I feel the weight of something beyond them
[02:24.98]I don’t see what I can feel
[02:28.57]If vision is the only validation
[02:31.99]Then most of my life isn’t real
[02:34.31]
[02:35.26]Coz if you’re not really here
[02:38.74]Then the stars don’t even matter
[02:42.36]Now I’m filled to the top with fear
[02:45.76]That it’s all just a bunch of matter
[02:49.40]Coz if you’re not really here
[02:53.18]Then I don’t wanna be either
[02:55.98]I wanna be next to you
[02:59.44]Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
[03:04.41]
[03:10.03]I wanna be next to you
[03:13.46]Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
[03:18.57]
[03:24.22]Mmm
[03:27.90]Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
[03:31.83]Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[03:37.85]
[03:46.33]Coz if you’re not really here
[03:49.41]Then the stars don’t even matter
[03:52.85]Now I’m filled to the top with fear
[03:56.21]That it’s all just a bunch of matter
[04:00.06]Coz if you’re not really here
[04:03.77]I don’t wanna be either
[04:06.68]I wanna be, next to you
[04:10.02]Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
[04:14.86]black and gold ......
