[00:10.65]By Pevy Jane
[00:16.94]
[00:21.07]I can hear you downstairs crying on the phone
[00:27.96]Telling someone that I'm here but you still feel all alone
[00:34.93]Maybe we were too young
[00:37.99]Goodbye, I've gotta go
[00:41.60]I can hear the baby waking up
[00:44.60]Got to get back to the life I know
[00:48.69]
[00:49.67]I should have never believed him
[01:03.62]Maybe I should just leave him
[01:07.59]
[01:09.74]Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
[01:16.93]Don't give up on me
[01:19.33]I'm about to come alive
[01:23.70]And I know that it's been hard
[01:26.19]And it's been a long time coming
[01:30.94]Don't give up on me
[01:33.14]I'm about to come alive
[01:38.22]
[01:51.45]No one thought I was good enough for you
[01:55.07]Except for you
[01:58.26]Don't let them be right
[02:00.48]After all that we've been through
[02:04.78]'Cause somewhere over that rainbow
[02:08.17]There's a place for me
[02:10.05]A place with you
[02:11.86]
[02:13.20]Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
[02:19.56]Don't give up on me
[02:21.99]I'm about to come alive
[02:26.36]And I know that it's been hard
[02:28.83]And it's been a long time coming
[02:33.60]Don't give up on me
[02:35.96]I'm about to come alive
[02:38.96]
[02:40.16]In every frame upon our wall
[02:43.39]Lies a face that's seen it all
[02:46.60]Through ups and downs and then more downs
[02:50.05]We helped each other off of the ground
[02:54.17]No one knows what we've been through
[02:56.87]Making it ain't making it without you
[03:01.37]
[03:01.84]Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
[03:08.75]Don't give up on me
[03:10.58]I'm about to come alive
[03:14.94]And I know that it's been hard
[03:17.54]And it's been a long time coming
[03:21.92]Don't give up on me
[03:24.71]I'm about to come alive
[03:31.85]I'm about to come alive
[03:54.28]
[03:55.68]End
