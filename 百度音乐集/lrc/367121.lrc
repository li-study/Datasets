[00:00.76]Bleeding Love
[00:02.29]Leona Lewis
[00:06.07]
[00:19.28]Closed off from love
[00:21.72]I didn’t need the pain
[00:23.88]Once or twice was enough
[00:26.03]And it was all in vain
[00:28.66]Time starts to pass
[00:31.14]Before you know it you’re frozen
[00:33.57]
[00:37.21]But something happened
[00:39.35]For the very first time with you
[00:42.34]My heart melts into the ground
[00:45.15]Found something true
[00:46.95]And everyone’s looking round
[00:49.31]Thinking I’m going crazy
[00:51.87]
[00:56.16]But I don’t care what they say
[00:58.68]I’m in love with you
[01:00.90]They try to pull me away
[01:03.14]But they don’t know the truth
[01:05.18]My heart’s crippled by the vein
[01:07.93]That I keep on closing
[01:12.24]You cut me open and I
[01:14.85]Keep bleeding
[01:16.41]Keep, keep bleeding love
[01:19.35]I keep bleeding
[01:20.67]I keep, keep bleeding love
[01:23.95]Keep bleeding
[01:25.51]Keep, keep bleeding love
[01:31.00]You cut me open
[01:33.02]
[01:37.97]Trying hard not to hear
[01:40.29]But they talk so loud
[01:42.43]Their piercing sounds fill my ears
[01:44.90]Try to fill me with doubt
[01:47.15]Yet I know that the goal
[01:49.47]Is to keep me from falling
[01:52.22]
[01:56.22]But nothing’s greater
[01:57.67]Than the rush that comes with your embrace
[02:00.83]And in this world of loneliness
[02:03.80]I see your face
[02:05.43]Yet everyone around me
[02:08.10]Thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe
[02:14.67]But I don’t care what they say
[02:17.03]I’m in love with you
[02:19.32]They try to pull me away
[02:21.56]But they don’t know the truth
[02:23.81]My heart’s crippled by the vein
[02:26.48]That I keep on closing
[02:30.81]You cut me open and I
[02:33.23]Keep bleeding
[02:34.69]Keep, keep bleeding love
[02:37.85]I keep bleeding
[02:39.20]I keep, keep bleeding love
[02:42.55]Keep bleeding
[02:43.90]Keep, keep bleeding love
[02:49.27]You cut me open
[02:51.39]
[02:52.96]And it’s draining all of me
[02:57.57]Oh they find it hard to believe
[03:02.21]I’ll be wearing these scars
[03:04.33]For everyone to see
[03:09.26]
[03:10.21]I don’t care what they say
[03:12.54]I’m in love with you
[03:14.78]They try to pull me away
[03:16.96]But they don’t know the truth
[03:19.20]My heart’s crippled by the vein
[03:21.26]That I keep on closing
[03:26.27]You cut me open and I
[03:28.88]Keep bleeding
[03:30.21]Keep, keep bleeding love
[03:33.11]I keep bleeding
[03:34.61]I keep, keep bleeding love
[03:37.98]Keep bleeding
[03:39.50]Keep, keep bleeding love
[03:44.29]You cut me open and I
[03:47.29]Keep bleeding
[03:48.60]Keep, keep bleeding love
[03:51.46]I keep bleeding
[03:53.13]I keep, keep bleeding love
[03:56.38]Keep bleeding
[03:57.75]Keep, keep bleeding love
[04:03.09]You cut me open and I
[04:05.62]Keep bleeding
[04:07.22]Keep, keep bleeding love
[04:11.68]
