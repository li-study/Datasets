[00:18.69]boy
[00:19.79]No matter what we go through
[00:22.21]You step up, I’ll step up too
[00:24.44]It don’t matter what the haters say
[00:26.43]As long as you are my boo
[00:28.53]No matter how hard it gets
[00:31.11]This love will have no regrets
[00:33.49]As long as we’ll be
[00:34.38]Stepping on the dance floor
[00:36.13]It’s me and you
[00:36.72]Feel the rhythm of the beat
[00:38.61]That’s my heart
[00:39.52]Cupid shot me with an arrow
[00:40.84]From the start
[00:41.84]And you know that it’s your loving that’s got me trapped
[00:43.99]Every time I try to leave, you bring me back
[00:46.30]So much harder at times I cried a river
[00:48.50]You dried my eyes and brought me back to laughter
[00:50.79]And when I lay next to you I want to wake up
[00:53.17]And when I break up
[00:54.27]It’s only to make up
[00:55.33]Boy
[00:56.29]No matter what we go through
[00:58.54]You step up, I’ll step up too
[01:00.85]It don’t matter what the haters say
[01:02.94]As long as you are my boo
[01:05.39]No matter how hard it gets
[01:07.78]This love will have no regrets
[01:10.04]As long as we’ll be
[01:11.21]Stepping on the dance floor
[01:12.61]It’s me and you
[01:50.92]And when the symphony plays, I feel my feet
[01:53.22]Lifting from underneath
[01:55.46]You grab my hand
[01:56.76]Spin me around
[01:58.03]And right before I fall
[02:00.05]You catch me and you say
[02:02.14]Baby, it’ll be okay
[02:04.63]Just look into my eyes and we will make another day
[02:08.57]Boy

[02:25.89]It’s me and you
[01:13.35]And if we don’t step up
[01:14.78]We’ll lose our groove
[01:16.08]So confused, don’t know which way to move
[01:18.32]Hold my hand and let me know that you feel me too
[01:20.41]Look into my eyes and tell me
[01:21.58]Baby I love you
[01:22.88]You’ll never get wet
[01:23.46]'Cause I’ll be your umbrella
[01:25.10]And we can make it through any kind of weather
[01:27.40]If you step up
[01:28.23]I’ll step up
[01:29.38]Boy
[01:30.24]‘Cause I’m trying to be with you forever
[01:32.20]Boy
[01:33.01]No matter what we go through
[01:35.26]You step up, I’ll step up too
