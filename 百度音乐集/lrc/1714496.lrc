[00:07.90]Ah.............
[00:15.20]Took a right
[00:17.92]to the end of the line where
[00:20.06]No one ever goes
[00:23.23]Ended up
[00:25.61]on a broken train with nobody I know
[00:31.03]But the pain
[00:33.03]and the longings the same where the dying
[00:39.14]Now I`m lost and I`m screaming for help

[02:58.54][02:42.82][02:11.20][01:55.50][00:48.54]For there is nothing that we can do

[01:24.89]There is an answer to the darkest times
[01:30.26]It`s clear
[01:32.77]we don`t understand but the last thing on my mind
[01:38.04]Is to leave you
[01:40.11]I believe that we`re in this together
[01:46.04]Don`t scream
