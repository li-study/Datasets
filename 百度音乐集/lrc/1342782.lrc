[00:01.12]Lights - Lions!
[00:05.89]
[00:15.66]Give me a disaster, give me an emergency
[00:23.00]Stand me at the head of the crusade without a remedy
[00:30.70]Show me to the shipwreck, show me how you're bones shake
[00:38.08]And when I'm at the edge of sorrow's blade,
[00:42.35]show me how a heart breakes
[00:45.35]
[00:46.86]Be steady on your feet
[00:50.47]No matter the trouble you meet
[00:53.76]
[00:54.93]Lions make you brave
[00:58.46]Giants give you faith
[01:02.34]Death is a charade
[01:05.58]You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid
[01:12.26]
[01:13.02]Find me at the bottom looking at the vultures
[01:20.57]Standing in the heart of the disease,
[01:24.55]following the hard curves
[01:28.32]I'm looking for the thunder, I'm looking for the blacknes
[01:35.92]I'm learning how to get up off my knees and all takes is practice
[01:43.46]
[01:44.60]Be ready on your feet
[01:48.04]No matter the trouble you meet
[02:26.38][01:51.90]
[02:42.60][02:26.94][01:52.50]Lions make you brave
[02:46.11][02:30.70][01:56.13]Giants give you faith
[02:49.93][02:34.83][02:00.01]Death is a charade
[03:00.91][02:53.14][02:37.85][02:03.25]You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid
[03:11.80][02:10.03]
[02:12.44]I'm not the hunter, I'm not the marked
[02:19.61]Just looking for wisdom in the dark
