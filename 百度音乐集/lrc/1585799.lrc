[00:14.10]to their uncaring fathers and misunderstanding mothers
[00:17.11]And they'll dream of a time when they're back again,
[00:20.43]with all their friends, at another show
[00:24.03]Where they will sing, "These are the days...
[01:48.19][01:06.90][00:30.22]These are the days we will never forget!"

[02:00.41]Sitting under the corner light, my six string in my hand
[02:06.07]Playing my songs all by myself, thinking,
