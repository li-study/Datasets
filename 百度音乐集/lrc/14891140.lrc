[00:17.81]Remember when I was young and so were you
[00:25.45]And time stood still and love was all we knew
[00:32.61]You were the first, so was I
[00:37.07]We made love and then you cried
[00:40.47]Remember when
[00:43.38]
[00:49.89]Remember when we vowed the vows
[00:55.88]and walked the walk
[00:57.73]gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
[01:04.85]We lived and learned, life threw curves
[01:09.05]There was joy, there was hurt
[01:12.63]Remember when
[01:15.60]
[01:22.33]Remember when old ones died and new were born
[01:29.56]And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
[01:37.23]We came together, fell apart
[01:41.36]And broke each other's hearts
[01:44.81]Remember when
[01:47.14]
[02:25.19]Remember when the sound of little feet
[02:32.86]was the music
[02:37.65]We danced to week to week
[02:40.21]Brought back the love, we found trust
[02:44.80]Vowed we'd never give it up
[02:48.08]Remember when
[02:50.19]
[02:55.87]Remember when thirty seemed so old
[03:03.23]Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
[03:10.78]To where we are,
[03:13.01]where we've been
[03:15.29]Said we'd do it all again
[03:18.56]Remember when
[03:23.50]
[03:30.03]Remember when we said when we turned gray
[03:37.78]When the children grow up and move away
[03:45.08]We won't be sad, we'll be glad
[03:49.68]For all the life we've had
[03:55.81]And we'll remember when
[04:03.77]
[04:04.39]Remember when
[04:12.19]Remember when
