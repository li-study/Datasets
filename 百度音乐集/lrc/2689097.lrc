[00:07.31]My mamma done told me
[00:10.71]When I was in pigtails
[00:14.44]My mamma done told me, "hon
[00:21.45]A man is a two-face
[00:24.91]He'll give you the big eye
[00:29.39]And when the sweet talking's done
[00:35.68]A man is a two-face
[00:39.34]A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
[00:42.92]The blues in the night."
[00:48.83]
[00:50.68]Now the rains a-fallin'
[00:54.24]Hear the trains a-callin', "whooee!"
[01:05.42]Hear the lonesome whistle
[01:08.63]Blowin' across the trestle, "whooee!"
[01:18.49]A-whooee-ah-whooee, clickety-clack
[01:24.14]Comes echoing back
[01:26.77]The blues in the night
[01:32.11]
[01:33.66]From natchez to mobile
[01:36.99]From memphis to st. Joe
[01:40.73]Wherever the four winds blow
[01:46.90]I've been in some big towns
[01:50.54]And heard me some big talk
[01:55.01]But there is one thing I know
[02:01.29]A man is a two-face,
[02:04.83]a worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
[02:08.41]The blues in the night
[02:14.39]
[02:58.25]My mamma done told me
[03:01.87]When I was in pig tails
[03:05.57]My mamma done told me, "hon
[03:12.49]A man is a two-face
[03:16.05]He'll give you the big eye
[03:20.58]And when the sweet talking's done
[03:26.72]A man is a two-face
[03:30.31]A worrisome thing
[03:32.58]Who'll leave you to sing
[03:34.33]The blues in the night
[03:46.88]
[03:57.38]My mamma done told me
