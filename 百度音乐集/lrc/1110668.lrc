[00:16.25]Who can tell me if we have heaven,
[00:22.50]who can say the way it should be;
[00:29.06]Moonlight holly, the Sappho Comet,
[00:35.15]Angel's tears below a tree.
[00:41.22]You talk of the break of morning
[00:47.43]as you view the new aurora,
[00:53.68]Cloud in crimson, the key of heaven,
[00:59.75]one love carved in acajou.
[01:29.84]One told me of China Roses,
[01:36.26]One a Thousand nights and one night,
[01:42.70]Earth's last picture, the end of evening:
[01:48.70]hue of indigo and blue.
[01:57.59]A new moon leads me to
[02:08.54]woods of dreams and I follow.
[02:14.81]A new world waits for me;
[02:25.02]my dream, my way.
[02:36.37]I know that if I have heaven
[02:40.82]there is nothing to desire.
[02:47.06]Rain and river, a world of wonder
[02:52.99]may be paradise to me.
