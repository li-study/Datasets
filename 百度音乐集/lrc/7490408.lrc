[00:22.52]Even if you were a million miles away
[00:25.20]I could still feel you in my bed
[00:29.01]Near me, touch me, feel me
[00:34.54]And even in the bottom of the sea
[00:36.86]I can still hear inside my head
[00:40.32]Telling me, touch me, feel me
[00:46.16]And all the time you were telling me lies
[00:48.64]
[00:50.29]So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[00:56.36]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[01:03.55]I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
[01:07.70]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[01:13.61]
[01:14.65]Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart
[01:17.66]Well you can try sleeping in my bed
[01:21.43]Lonely, only, nobody ever shut it down like you
[01:26.68]You wore the crown, you make my body feel heaven-bound
[01:31.05]Why don't you hold me, need me, I thought you told me
[01:35.31]You'd never leave me
[01:37.30]
[01:38.10]Looking in the sky I can see your face
[01:40.76]And i knew right where I'd fit in
[01:44.23]Take me, make me
[01:46.85]You know that I'll always be in love with you
[01:51.73]Right til the end
[01:56.05]
[01:56.78]So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[02:02.81]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[02:09.60]I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
[02:13.95]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[02:18.08]
[02:18.94]Anybody could have told you right from the start
[02:22.67]It's bout fall apart
[02:25.92]So rather than hold onto a broken dream
[02:29.05]Or just hold onto love
[02:32.10]And I could find a way to make it
[02:35.11]Don't hold on too tight
[02:38.06]I'll make it without you tonight
[02:40.24]
[02:40.73]So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[02:46.69]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[02:53.82]I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
[02:57.93]Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[03:10.03]
