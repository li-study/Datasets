[00:23.00]Step by step I come closer to reaching the top
[00:30.00]Every step must be placed so that I don't fall off
[00:37.00]Looking down to see about how much higher I am
[00:45.00]Another cool wind comes through, brushes my skin
[01:00.00]The harder I push the tension does grow
[01:07.00]I gather my thoughts the further and further I go
[01:14.00]With some luck I just might keep on climbing
[01:21.00]So better to climb than to face a fall
[04:27.00][03:53.00][02:28.00][01:29.00]So high the climb
[04:30.00][03:56.00][02:32.00][01:32.00]Can't turn back now
[04:33.00][04:00.00][02:35.00][01:36.00]Must keep climbing up to the clouds
[04:07.00][02:42.00][01:42.00]So high the climb
[04:11.00][02:46.00][01:47.00]Can't turn back now
[04:15.00][02:50.00][01:50.00]Must keep climbing up to the clouds
[01:58.00]Pulling myself up by a rope I better my view
[02:06.00]The only thing in sight is what I must do
[02:13.00]As I turned I could see myself falling
[02:20.00]Which in return gave me strength for the climb
[03:09.00]Although many failed
[03:10.00]I must now prevail with no question
[03:16.00]Have no time to stop
[03:17.00]Onward to the top of the mountain
[03:23.00]And I can't turn back now
[03:30.00]It's so very high but I can't turn back now
[03:39.00]If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it
[03:45.00]I'm so very close can't you see
[04:56.00][04:52.00][04:50.00][04:48.00]I'm getting closer...
