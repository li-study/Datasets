[00:00.20]Regrets are all you left
[00:02.87]On your lipstick stains
[00:06.15]Take a picture of our past
[00:09.45]There in that ashtray
[00:13.80]We had our fun
[00:15.81]I used to light your flame
[00:19.20]Like the dancing smoke that rose
[00:22.12]We tried to find our way
[00:26.42]No one told me
[00:29.73]She told me
[00:31.99]Your love's like one last cigarette
[00:35.22]Last cigarette
[00:36.47]I will savor it
[00:38.32]The last cigarette
[00:39.75]Take it in and hold your breath
[00:41.43]Hope it never ends
[00:42.61]But when it's gone, it's gone
[00:45.25]The last cigarette
[00:53.17]Just to breathe
[00:54.42]Reminds me of what used to be
[00:59.44]The smoke's the ghost that keeps you close
[01:02.49]When I can't sleep
[01:06.11]Don't ask the past to last
[01:08.75]It's about to change
[01:12.58]The memories don't answer
[01:15.22]When I call your name
[01:19.14]No one told me
[01:22.52]She told me
[01:24.67]Your love's like one last cigarette
[01:27.88]Last cigarette
[01:29.15]I will savor it
[01:31.08]The last cigarette
[01:32.48]Take it in and hold your breath
[01:34.17]Hope it never ends
[01:35.87]But when it's gone, it's gone
[01:39.28]One last cigarette
[01:41.20]Last cigarette
[01:42.51]One I can't forget
[01:44.52]The last cigarette
[01:45.89]Right there at my fingertips
[01:47.48]I got your taste still on my lips
[01:49.34]Right or wrong
[01:51.94]You're still gone, gone, gone...
[02:16.01]No one told me
[02:19.33]She told me
[02:22.37]You always lose the girl
[02:29.07]In a Brian Wilson world
[02:36.20]One last cigarette
[02:39.54]I will savor it
[02:42.73]Take it in and hold your breath
[02:44.56]Hope it never ends
[02:45.58]But when it's gone, it's gone
[02:49.57]One last cigarette
[02:51.44]Last cigarette
[02:52.74]I will savor it
[02:54.70]The last cigarette
[02:56.08]Take it in and hold your breath
[02:57.76]Hope it never ends
[02:58.86]But when it's gone, it's gone
[03:02.79]One last cigarette
[03:04.79]Last cigarette
[03:06.16]One I can't forget
[03:08.01]The last cigarette
[03:09.45]Right there at my fingertips
[03:11.04]I got your taste still on my lips
[03:12.92]Right or wrong
[03:14.96]The last cigarette
[03:16.22](No one told me)
[03:18.31]The last cigarette
[03:19.60](She told me)
[03:21.59]The last cigarette
[03:22.97](The last cigarette)
