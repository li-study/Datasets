[00:01.70]Norah Jones - Waiting
[00:03.43]
[00:10.65]Hush now watch the stars fall
[00:15.45]Into a fire wall
[00:20.13]I am waiting here
[00:23.30]Waiting for you to come home
[00:26.90]
[00:30.82]Sinking embers glow
[00:36.00]Melting icy snow
[00:40.54]I am waiting here,
[00:43.52]Waiting for you to come home
[00:48.02]
[01:00.92]And I watch them burn
[01:03.58]When will I ever learn
[01:10.96]If I wait it doesn't mean
[01:15.05]You will return
[01:20.61]
[01:57.22]And I watch them burn
[01:59.71]When will I ever learn
[02:03.77]
[02:07.21]If I wait it doesn't mean
[02:11.53]You will return
[02:16.89]
[02:23.47]Now all the stars have gone
[02:28.29]Faded into cracks of dawn
[02:32.93]And I'm still waiting here
[02:35.92]Waiting for you to come home
[02:40.07]
[02:53.23]I'm waiting here
[02:56.41]Waiting for you to come home
[03:00.65]
