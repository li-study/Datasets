[00:48.00]Oh, when you walk by every night
[00:51.00]Talking sweet and looking fine
[00:53.00]I get kind of hectic inside
[00:57.00]Baby I'm so into you
[01:00.00]Darling if you only knew
[01:02.00]All the things that flow through my mind
[01:08.00]I'm in heaven

[01:17.00]There's no beginning
[01:18.00]And there is no end
[01:21.00]Feels like I'm dreaming
[01:23.00]But I'm not sleeping
[01:29.00](But it's just) sweet fantasy, baby

[01:47.00]Creep into me slowly
[01:50.00]]As you're going to my head
[01:54.00]And my heart beats faster
[01:57.00]When you take me over
[01:59.00]Time and time and time again
