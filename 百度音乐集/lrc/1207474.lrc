[00:02.00]Against Me! - One By One
[00:07.00]
[00:25.30]I feel the ground moving under my feet,
[00:28.16]all I know is where I don't belong.
[00:31.95]I'm not interested in sticking around
[00:34.99]just for the sake of a good time.
[00:38.55]Houses rotting from the the inside out
[00:41.48]and everybody's pissed out of their fucking minds.
[00:44.97]Are you seriously talking to me about community?
[02:10.49][00:51.73]One by one, shoot off my fingers one by one.
[02:16.15][00:57.88]Where do we go from here? Where do we go from here?
[02:19.79][01:01.69]When the rebels lose the spirit of rebellion.
[02:35.94][02:23.42][01:17.77][01:04.46]You've got nowhere left to go.
[02:45.50][02:32.80][01:27.44][01:14.23]But I know I'm not alone.
[01:43.06]We are defined by what we stand
[01:45.97]against and the weight of unfulfilled expectations.
[01:50.22]This culture that threatens to engulf you,
[01:53.72]is this anyway to go about fighting it?
[01:57.40]I don't want to be born again,
[01:59.81]I don't need anybody to speak for me.
[02:03.03]I'm not interested in humoring illusions
[02:06.24]or apologizing for the sake of sentiment.
