[00:02.42]A Case of you
[00:15.47]
[00:20.22]Just before our love got lost you said
[00:26.34]I am as constant as the northern star
[00:29.06]And I said, constantly in the darkness
[00:33.76]Where's that at
[00:35.51]If you want me I'll be in the bar
[00:41.05]
[00:41.67]On the back of a cartoon coaster
[00:48.95]In the blue TV screen light
[00:53.62]I drew a map of Canada
[00:56.78]Oh, Canada
[01:04.09]With your face sketched on it twice
[01:08.34]
[01:08.70]Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
[01:15.08]You taste so bitter and so sweet
[01:19.23]And I could drink a case of you, my darling
[01:27.51]And I would still be on my feet
[01:32.44]I will still be on my feet
[01:41.45]
[01:49.19]Oh, I am a lonely painter
[01:56.64]I live in a box of paints
[02:00.75]I'm frightened by the devil
[02:05.09]And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
[02:11.84]I remember that time you told me
[02:17.15]said Love is touching souls
[02:21.06]Oh Surely you touched mine
[02:24.21]Cause Part of you pours out of me
[02:29.18]In these lines from time to time
[02:34.88]
[02:35.21]Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
[02:41.97]so bitter bitter and sweet
[02:46.70]And I could drink a case of you, my darling
[02:53.43]And I Would still be on my feet
[02:59.21]I would still be on my feet
[03:08.48]
[03:14.55]I met a woman she had a mouth like yours
[03:21.17]She knew your life
[03:23.24]She knew your devils and your deeds
[03:26.01]And she said, go to him
[03:29.45]Stay with him if you care
[03:32.65]But be prepared to bleed
[03:37.93]
[03:38.26]Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
[03:44.46]so bitter and so sweet
[03:49.06]And I could drink a case of you, my darling
[03:58.11]And I Would still be on my feet
[04:02.65]I would still be on my feet
