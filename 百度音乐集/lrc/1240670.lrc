[00:19.12][00:37.06]Did you know
[00:20.67]Hidden by his clothes there are some scars
[00:28.01]Some are recent
[00:30.58]Some have been there for years
[00:39.49]It doesn’t even hurt
[00:46.40]It never really hurts
[00:48.40]But there are tears
[00:54.23][01:57.31][03:09.52][03:27.42]Do you want the real story
[00:56.49][01:59.58][03:11.72][03:29.70]Or do you prefer the lie
[00:58.73][02:01.81][03:13.93][03:31.94]Do you want to see him smile
[01:01.22][02:04.15][03:16.40][03:34.31]Or maybe see him cry
[01:03.58][02:06.62][03:18.76][03:36.79]Do you want to follow
[01:05.56][02:08.62][03:20.73][03:38.77]Or let him go alone
[01:07.40][02:10.41][03:40.31]For then, never to know… never to know
[01:15.96][02:19.05][02:23.57][02:28.05]Never to know
[01:22.28]Have you seen the way he acts sometimes
[01:31.10]And when you ask
[01:32.00]He’ll say that he’s okay
[01:40.22]Have you seen how well he pretends
[01:49.78]Laughs out loud
[01:51.47]Before he looks away
[03:22.48]For then, never to know
[03:47.61]
