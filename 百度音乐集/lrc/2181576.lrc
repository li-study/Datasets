[00:50.27]
[00:54.65]Many's the time I ran with you down
[01:03.61]The rainy roads of your old town
[01:10.16]Many the lives we lived in each day
[01:16.35]And buried altogether
[01:19.49]Don't laugh at me
[01:25.27]Don't look away
[01:31.01]You'll follow me back
[01:32.17]With the sun in your eyes
[01:35.51]And on your own
[01:38.45]Bedshaped
[01:41.67]And legs of stone
[01:44.67]You'll knock on my door
[01:48.31]And up we'll go
[01:51.31]In white light
[01:54.41]I don't think so
[01:58.16]But what do I know?
[02:01.26]What do I know?
[02:04.58]I know!
[02:07.57]
[02:08.38]I know you think I'm holding you down
[02:13.49]And I've fallen by the wayside now
[02:19.44]And I don't understand the same things as you
[02:25.60]But I do
[02:29.55]
[02:29.91]Don't laugh at me
[02:35.29]Don't look away
[02:41.06]
[02:41.27]You'll follow me back
[02:42.89]With the sun in your eyes
[02:43.25]And on your own
[02:48.57]Bedshaped
[02:51.80]And legs of stone
[02:54.88]You'll knock on my door
[02:58.17]And up we'll go
[03:01.22]In white light
[03:04.39]I don't think so
[03:08.06]But what do I know?
[03:11.39]What do I know?
[03:14.76]I know!
[03:19.52]
[04:00.36]And up we'll go
[04:06.23]In white light
[04:09.56]I don't think so
[04:13.09]But what do I know?
[04:16.25]What do I know?
[04:23.37]I know!
