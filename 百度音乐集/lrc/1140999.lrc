[00:04.41]Boulevard Of Broken Dreams
[00:07.55]Green Day
[00:09.72]
[00:11.80]I walk a lonely road
[00:14.22]The only one that I have ever known
[00:17.46]Don't know where it goes
[00:20.10]But it's home to me and I walk alone
[00:28.43]I walk this empty street
[00:31.74]On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
[00:35.38]Where the city sleeps
[00:37.24]and I'm the only one and I walk alone
[00:41.39]
[00:42.65]I walk alone
[00:45.10]I walk alone
[00:49.19]I walk alone
[00:51.28]I walk a...
[00:52.50]My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
[00:57.93]My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
[01:03.95]Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
[01:09.82]'Til then I walk alone
[01:14.87]Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,
[01:21.47]Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah
[01:26.73]I'm walking down the line
[01:29.22]That divides me somewhere in my mind
[01:32.89]On the border line
[01:35.03]Of the edge and where I walk alone
[01:43.63]Read between the lines
[01:46.32]What's fucked up and everything's alright
[01:50.10]Check my vital signs
[01:52.12]To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
[01:56.24]
[01:56.89]I walk alone
[01:59.83]I walk alone
[02:04.10]I walk alone
[02:05.62]I walk a...
[02:06.90]My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
[02:13.07]My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
[02:18.81]Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
[02:24.46]'Til then I walk alone
[02:28.89]
[02:29.33]Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah
[02:36.02]Ah-ah, Ah-ah
[02:38.61]I walk alone
[02:40.31]I walk a...
[02:42.10]
[03:06.48]I walk this empty street
[03:09.72]On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
[03:13.63]Where the city sleeps
[03:15.55]And I'm the only one and I walk a...
[03:18.82]My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
[03:24.69]My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
[03:30.03]Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
[03:36.19]'Til then I walk alone...
