[01:09.70]got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
[01:12.34]inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
[01:15.66]based off the way we was branded

[01:20.21]and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
[01:23.33]but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
[01:26.87]I need a happy ending and a new beginning
[01:28.84]and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative

[01:55.06]I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
[01:59.43]I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[02:05.21]

[02:07.89]the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
[02:10.41]this is more than just my road to redemption
[02:12.83]Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
[02:15.27]as long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me
[02:18.13]but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
[02:20.77]
[02:21.37]I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
[02:24.12]if a n-gga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
[02:26.26]but this pimp is, ar the top of mount Olympus
[02:28.66]ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
