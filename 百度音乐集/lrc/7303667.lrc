
[00:02.65]The Greatest
[00:05.87]Cat Power
[00:08.78]
[00:19.16]Once I wanted to be the greatest
[00:27.90]No wind or waterfall could stop me
[00:35.17]And then came the rush of the flood
[00:41.04]The stars at night turned you to dust
[00:48.17]
[00:48.83]Melt me downTo big black armour
[00:54.79]Leave no trace
[00:57.89]Of grace
[00:59.23]Just in your honor
[01:03.68]Lower me down
[01:07.24]That corporate slob
[01:09.74]Make a watch
[01:11.69]For a space in town
[01:13.36]For the lack of the drugs
[01:16.54]My faith had been sleeping
[01:21.46]Lower me down
[01:24.31]In the end
[01:25.88]Secure the grounds
[01:30.52]For the later parade
[01:33.57]
[01:41.44]Once I wanted to be the greatest
[01:50.27]Two faced, sad little rock
[01:58.95]When things I couldn't explain
[02:02.78]Any feelings
[02:06.52]Lower me down
[02:09.32]In the end
[02:11.12]Secure the grounds
[02:16.27]For the lack of the drugs
[02:19.66]My faith had been sleeping
[02:24.63]For the later parade
[02:26.85]
[02:43.96]Once I wanted to be the greatest
[02:52.94]No wind or water fall could stop me
[03:00.20]And then came the rush of the flood
[03:06.25]The stars at night turned you to dust
[03:12.03]
