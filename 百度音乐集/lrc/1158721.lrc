[00:13.50]What I choose to do is of no concern to you and your friends
[00:33.50]Where I lay my hat may not be my home, but I will last on my own
[00:54.50]'Cause it's me, and my life
[01:04.57]it's my life
[01:14.50]Oh the world has sat in the palm of your hand not that you'd see
[01:34.87]and I'm tired and bored of waiting for you
[01:46.24]and all those things you never do
[01:55.51]'Cause it's me, and my life
[02:06.00]it's my life
[02:10.50]it's my life
