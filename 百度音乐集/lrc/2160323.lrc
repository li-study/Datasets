[00:02.37]\"Over You\"
[00:03.32]
[00:03.65]Now that it’s all said and done
[00:06.54]I can’t believe you were the one
[00:09.68]To build me up and tear me down
[00:13.22]Like an old abandoned house
[00:15.96]What you said when you left
[00:18.50]Just left me cold and out of breath
[00:21.78]I felt as if I was in way to deep
[00:25.02]Guess I let you get the best of meeee
[00:29.31]
[00:30.11]Well I never saw it coming
[00:31.94]I should have started running
[00:33.37]A long, long time agooo!
[00:36.42]And I never thought I’d doubt you
[00:38.03]I’m better off without you
[00:39.88]More than you, more than you know
[00:42.80]I’m slowly getting closure
[00:44.25]I guess it’s really over
[00:45.78]I’m finally gettin’ better
[00:48.50]Now I’m picking up the pieces
[00:50.34]From spending all of these years
[00:51.93]Putting my heart back together
[00:55.13]‘Cause the day I thought I’d never get through
[00:59.22]I got over you!!!
[01:01.29]
[01:07.96]You took a hammer to these walls
[01:11.15]Dragged the memories down the hall
[01:14.29]Packed your bags and walked away
[01:17.94]There was nothing I could say,
[01:20.32]And when you slammed the front door shut
[01:23.45]A lot of other’s opened up
[01:26.30]So did my eyes so I could see
[01:28.81]That you never were the best for meee
[01:33.33]
