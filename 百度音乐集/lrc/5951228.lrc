[00:05.71]爱的冒险/I Believe
[00:08.24]
[00:10.73]When I was just a little girl
[00:12.94]My momma used to tuck me into bed
[00:16.19]and she read me a story
[00:20.10]It always was about a Princess in distress
[00:23.78]And how a guy would save her
[00:25.45]and end up with the glory
[00:29.45]I'd lie in bed and think about the person that
[00:33.12]I wanted to be
[00:34.39]Then one day I realized the fairy tale life
[00:37.88]wasn't for me
[03:10.16][02:45.92][02:27.28][01:40.23][00:39.07]I don't wanna be like Cinderella
[03:12.07][02:48.43][02:29.59][01:42.69][00:41.36]Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
[03:14.37][02:50.81][02:31.92][01:44.89][00:43.72]Waiting for somebody
[03:16.52][02:53.08][02:34.33][01:47.07][00:45.80]to come and set me free
[03:19.00][02:55.46][02:36.54][01:49.54][00:48.40]I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
[03:21.33][02:57.81][02:38.95][01:52.00][00:50.77]For a handsome prince to come and save me
[03:23.70][03:00.17][02:41.26][01:54.31][00:53.13]On a horse of white
[03:25.79][03:02.28][02:43.43][01:56.43][00:55.27]unless we're riding side by side
[03:27.67][03:04.05][01:58.20][00:56.99]Don't want to depend on no-one else
[03:31.05][03:07.48][02:01.87][01:00.53]I'd rather rescue myself
[02:05.00][01:04.10]
[01:11.63]Someday I'm gonna find someone
[01:14.41]who wants my soul
[01:15.76]heart and mind Who's not afraid
[01:17.90]to show that he loves me
[01:21.09]Somebody who will understand
[01:23.59]I'm happy just the way I am
[01:25.99]Don't need nobody taking care of me
[01:29.59](I will be there)
[01:30.88]I will be there for him just as strong as he
[01:34.32]will be there for me
[01:35.55]When I give myself then it has got to be
[01:39.17]an equal thing
[02:08.01]I can slay
[02:10.19]my own dragon
[02:12.61]I can dream
[02:14.67]my own dreams
[02:17.74]My knight in shining armour is me
[02:24.67]So I'm gonna set me free
