[00:00.00]
[00:02.73]In my solitude
[00:11.50]You haunt me
[00:20.58]With dreadful ease
[00:26.46]Of days gone by
[00:37.59]In my solitude
[00:46.69]You taunt me
[00:56.61]With memories
[01:03.87]That never die
[01:14.89]I sit in my chair
[01:19.42]And filled with despair
[01:23.88]There's no one could be so sad
[01:32.98]With gloom everywhere
[01:37.56]I sit and I stare
[01:42.04]I know that I'll soon go mad
[01:50.36]In my solitude
[01:58.92]I'm afraid
[02:08.86]Dear Lord above
[02:16.75]Send back my love
[03:38.91]I sit in my chair
[03:43.06]And filled with despair
[03:47.40]There's no one could be so sad
[03:56.31]With gloom everywhere
[04:00.62]I sit and I stare
[04:04.24]I know that I'll soon go mad
[04:11.86]In my solitude
[04:21.60]I'm afraid
[04:30.33]Dear Lord above
[04:37.90]Send back my love
[04:48.47]Dear Lord above
[04:56.73]Send back my love
