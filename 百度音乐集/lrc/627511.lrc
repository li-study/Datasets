[00:00.73]Who You Are
[00:09.66]
[00:14.58]Frozen and broken
[00:18.49]Don't know where you're going
[00:21.65]Losing your identity
[00:28.24]You're so caught up in hiding
[00:32.53]But everybody sees
[00:36.48]
[00:36.73]You're never gonna feel
[00:38.35]You're never gonna heal
[00:40.00]You're never gonna know what's fake or real
[00:43.69]'Til you know who you are
[00:50.31]You're lying to your face
[00:51.90]And running in a race
[00:53.76]You're never gonna win 'til you find your place
[00:57.36]And you know who you are
[01:04.29]who you R
[01:06.22]
[01:12.28]You're crawling and falling
[01:16.25]But no one hears you calling
[01:19.30]When you're in a world of glass
[01:25.97]'Til your bubble bursts
[01:27.68]And the true you's first
[01:30.56]You're always coming last
[01:33.70]
[01:35.00]You're never gonna feel
[01:36.56]You're never gonna heal
[01:38.24]You're never gonna know what's fake or real
[01:41.92]'Til you know who you are
[01:48.58]You're lying to your face
[01:50.48]And running in a race
[01:52.00]You're never gonna win 'til you find your place
[01:55.55]And you know who you are
[02:01.71]
[02:03.41]You take yourself apart
[02:06.58]To medicate the pain
[02:10.20]It shouldn't be this hard
[02:13.43]To believe in you again
[02:18.72]who you R
[02:21.76]
[02:33.17]You're never gonna feel
[02:34.51]You're never gonna heal
[02:36.31]You're never gonna know what's fake or real
[02:39.86]'Til you know who you are
[02:46.89]You're lying to your face
[02:48.33]And running in a race
[02:50.11]You're never gonna win 'til you find your place
[02:53.69]And you know who you are
[03:01.17]who you R
[03:06.22]
[03:07.77]And you know who you are
[03:14.06]
[03:14.84]You're lying to your face
[03:16.47]And running in a race
[03:18.28]You're never gonna win 'til you find your place
[03:21.72]And you know who you are
[03:28.20]who you R
