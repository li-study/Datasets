[02:33.08]Eric clapton - Let it grow
[02:33.29]I'm standin' at the crossroads
[02:33.68]tryin' to read the signs
[02:34.01]to tell me which way I should
[02:34.24]go to find the answer
[02:34.43]and all the time I know
[02:34.60]let your love and let it grow.
[02:34.78]
[02:34.95]Let it grow, let it grow,
[02:35.13]let it blossom, let it flow.
[02:35.33]In the sun and in the snow
[02:35.50]love is lovely, let it grow.
[02:35.69]
[03:12.29]Lookin' for a reason
[03:12.53]to check out on my mind.
[03:12.70]It's so hard to find a
[03:13.08]friend that I can count on.
[03:13.28]There's nothin' left to show,
[03:13.47]plant your love and let it grow.
[03:13.64]Let it grow...
[03:13.83]
[03:14.01]Time is gettin' shorter
[03:14.20]and there's much for you to do,
[03:14.39]only ask'n you will get what you are needin',
[03:14.58]the rest is up to you.
[03:14.76]Plant your love and let it grow.
