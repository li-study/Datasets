[01:29.36]Tell me
[01:31.37]Remind me
[01:34.27]Chase the water racing from the sky
[01:39.30]Always beside me
[01:44.19]Taste the memories running from my eyes
[01:50.08]Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
[01:54.94]Liquid shadows silence their screams
[01:59.33]I smile at the moon
[02:01.12]Chasing water from the sky
[02:03.99]I argue with the clouds
[02:09.24]Outside the soundness of your mind
[02:15.58]Bathing your soul in silver tears
[02:22.59]Beneath a blackened summer sky
[02:28.99]Praying for time to disappear
[02:33.77]
[02:52.17]Beneath a summer sky
[02:55.76]Under glass moonlight
[02:59.40]Night awaits the lamb's arrival
[03:05.98]Liquid shadows crawl
[03:09.14]Silver teardrops fall
[03:12.32]The bride subsides to her survival
[03:17.06]
[03:18.73]By your hand
[03:22.01]I've awakened
[03:26.00]Bear this honor in my name
[03:30.31]
[03:32.13]Outside the soundness of your mind
[03:38.17]Bathing your soul in silver tears
[03:44.90]Beneath a blackened summer sky
[03:51.22]Praying for time to disappear
[03:56.30]
[06:22.44]Outside the soundness of your mind
[06:28.56]Bathing your soul in silver tears
[06:35.61]Beneath a blackened summer sky
[06:41.96]Praying for time to disappear
[06:48.90]
