[00:02.50]Girl, well it's been one of those days again
[00:10.00]and it seems like the harder I try
[00:14.00]over and over, I'm right back where I began
[00:21.00]but you understand
[00:23.00]Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
[00:32.00]oh I just wanna run to you

[00:45.00]Tell me what kind of man would I be
[00:50.00]living a life without any meaning
[00:56.00]And I know you could surely survive without me
[01:02.00]but if I had to live without you
[01:07.00]tell me what kind of man would I be
[01:16.00]Times when it was pointless for me to try
[01:24.00]I was more than a desperate man
[01:28.00]What seemed like forever
[01:30.00]was gone with one touch of your hand
[01:36.00]Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
[01:46.00]when you were there for me
[01:50.00]A fool could see, oh baby
[01:54.00]once that I found you there was no letting go
[01:59.00]Tell me what kind of man would I be
[02:04.00]living a life without any meaning
[02:10.00]And I know you could surely survive without me
[02:15.00]but if I had to live without you
[02:21.00]tell me what kind of man would I be
[02:26.00]
[02:48.00]Tell me what kind of man would I be
[02:53.00]living a life without any meaning
[02:59.00]And I know you could surely survive without me
[03:04.00]but if I had to live without you
[03:10.00]tell me what kind of man would I be
[03:13.00]what kind of man would I be
[03:17.00]living a life without any meaning
[03:23.00]And I know you could surely survive without me
[03:29.00]but if I had to live without you
[03:34.00]tell me what kind of man
[03:39.00]tell me what kind of man
[03:45.00]tell me what kind of man would I be
[03:55.00]tell me what kind of man would I be
