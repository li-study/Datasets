[al:]

[00:25.20]Don't you worry, I don't mean to make you sad
[00:30.03]My tears will soon be over
[00:32.70]With your conscience clear for a new life ahead
[00:36.64]Don't be sorry, I really need to hear the truth
[00:41.48]But the only thing I'm asking, 'cos I need you to
[00:45.50]Remember me, as the only one who set you free
[00:55.53]Maybe time alone will make you see
[01:00.72]How deep our love could be
[01:06.77]No, it's never too late
[01:11.88]'Cos I know, this isn't the first time
[01:17.19]It won't be the last time
[01:20.52]I surrender my soul
[01:23.35]'Cos you're always, keepin' me waitin', anticapatin'
[01:31.93]The day we find love once again
[01:41.94]I won't give up while there's a glimmer of a chance
[01:46.89]A dream that's never ending
[01:49.77]Inviting love and a perfect romance
[01:53.39]A burning passion, oh baby you're my destiny
[01:58.31]But the message I'm receivin', is that your through with me
[02:02.36]But I'll be there, even though you tell me you don't care
[02:12.21]How could you forget the times we've shared
[02:17.55]Don't throw our love away, you know it's never too late
[02:28.77]Chorus
[03:08.63]Remember me as the only one who set you free
[03:18.40]Maybe time alone will make you see
[03:23.67]How deep our love could be
[03:29.31]No it's never too late
[03:37.45]Chorus
