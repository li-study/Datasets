[00:20.69]I watch you growing sometimes
[00:24.60]I see myself - in you
[00:30.00]It can be scary but kinda funny too
[00:37.48]Ahh......
[00:43.00]I hear you talking
[00:47.00]A lot of similarities
[00:50.22]Your choice of words
[00:54.24]And all the fantasises
[02:58.30][02:03.00][01:00.47]Just the way we are
[03:01.42][02:06.66][01:04.00]I guess you've seen it now
[03:06.00][02:10.58][01:07.22]A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
[03:26.00][03:11.00][02:15.62][01:13.00]Falling down
[03:30.00][03:13.55][02:18.78][01:16.00]From a mountain of frights
[03:35.37][03:18.00][02:22.30][01:20.00]What's there to hold on to?
[01:25.50]The way you makes all smile
[01:28.00]and the despair when you just
[01:29.58]Won't go to sleep
[01:33.00]You could have me walking a mile
[01:35.14]to make you smile still it's not
[01:37.75]really a weep
[01:40.56]Ahh......
[01:46.37]I know you fooled me
[01:50.00]A million times
[01:54.00]I just can't help it
[01:58.50]Don't know why
[02:39.52]I know you hate it but they really have to do
[02:45.00]What they do
[02:46.62]You're crying out your wishes I understand
[02:53.00]Yet they don't have a clue.
