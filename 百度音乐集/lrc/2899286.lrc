[00:32.96]It's the way of a cosmic sailor, in a boat in the night
[00:39.26]But the wolves are not seating him he is alright
[00:45.03]Just the day just the day away I can feel it sometimes
[00:53.23]But the wolves are not scaring me I long for twilight
[01:01.13]Then with the morning comes
[01:03.99]The sun that finds them all so divides the night and they die
[01:15.61]And with the morning sun
[01:18.45]A lonely teardrop falls down from my eye and I die
[01:29.62]But where did all the cosmic sailors come from
[01:35.92]Far away from across the sea
[01:43.16]And where have all the cosmic sailors now gone
[01:50.79]And the night that showed them all to me
[02:21.55]On the waves of this silver ocean for a while there he smiles
[02:29.77]As he sails with the other ones the wind dies
[02:36.00]So a cry so a cry is calling all the wolves among the night
[02:43.34]As I sail with the other ories I find them alright
[04:31.76][02:50.20]Then with the morning comes
[04:39.91][02:53.49]The sun that finds them all so divides the night and they die
[04:48.78][03:02.56]And with the morning sun
[04:53.67][03:07.62]A lonely teardrop falls down from my eye and I die
[05:06.79]and i die
