[00:01.46]We're only 2cm away now,
[00:05.11]I'll be home again
[00:07.72]I'll be home again to a place that might have been
[00:13.03]Where people in the past times thought
[00:14.85]they were waterfalls around the edge of the sea
[00:19.31]Catch a drop of tear from me and tell me who you'd be
[00:24.88]
[00:36.13]I touch your back, so wide and shaking.
[00:38.58]Tell me why it's aching
[00:41.23]All the efforts that you're making
[00:43.77]are like the leaves awaking from the rain
[00:47.25]Come closer to me now I wanna touch your face
[00:51.58]All the love can't be erased.
[00:54.51]Come on and leave a trace
[00:57.08]And when I'm feeling powerless,
[00:59.74]I listen to the music they left by
[01:04.11]
[01:28.10][01:17.35]cuz our love is deeper and believer of the sea
[01:33.43][01:22.49]cuz you're the waves of my ocean

[01:38.51]
[01:41.18][01:38.54]so come and rock me
[01:48.74]
[01:49.39]今そっと明かりを消して　
[01:52.44]決して消えないものを抱えて
[01:57.91]輝いてく
[02:00.09]胸を張っていよう　
[02:01.67]私がここにいるのは
[02:05.64]貴方のために　
[02:08.24]貴方のために
[02:11.33]見上げてた空に心奪われないように
[02:17.66]
[02:31.41]cuz our love is deeper and believer of the sea　
[02:36.63]胸を張ってきっと　
[02:39.25]そのままでもっと
[02:42.00]cuz our love is deeper and believer of the sea　
[02:47.14]アレになればきっと

[02:54.94][02:52.42]so come and rock me
[03:03.99]
[03:05.29]潮の香りがして　
[03:10.16]見えるような気がして
[03:15.69]指差した　はるかかなたの島々を
[03:26.81]透き通る陰に　浸透して
[03:31.83]立ちすくんでそっと　
[03:34.65]だけど倒れない
[03:37.22]夢も変わって行く　感情のうえ
[03:42.45]聞き方が悪い　私のせいね
[03:47.28]
[03:58.40][03:47.71]cuz our love is deeper and believer of the sea
[04:03.57][03:53.05]cuz you're the waves of my ocean
[04:06.12][03:55.52]you're the waves of my ocean
