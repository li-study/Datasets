[00:02.61]Where have all the good men gone And
[00:07.15]where are all the gods
[00:10.99]Where's the street-wise Hercules
[00:15.04]To fight the rising odds
[00:20.17]Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed
[00:28.76]Late at night toss and turn and dream of what I need
[00:43.93]I need a hero
[00:46.23]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
[03:44.24][00:50.22]He's gotta be strong
[03:45.46][00:51.79]And he's gotta be fast
[03:47.19][00:53.23]And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
[03:50.31][03:03.20][00:56.52]I need a hero
[03:05.59][00:59.00]I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
[03:09.44][01:02.81]He's gotta be sure
[03:10.83][01:04.32]And it's gotta be soon
[03:12.43][01:05.99]And he's gotta be larger than life
[01:09.04]larger than life
[01:23.11]Somewhere after midnight
[01:25.41]In my wildest fantasy
[01:29.26]Somewhere just beyond my reach
[01:32.15]There's someone reaching back for me
[01:35.68]Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
[01:42.01]It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet
[01:59.71]Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
[02:02.65]Out where the lightning splits the sea
[02:05.82]I would swear that there's someone somewhere
[02:08.61]Watching me
[02:12.17]Through the wind and the chill and the rain
[02:15.38]And the storm and the flood
[02:18.51]I can feel his approach
[02:20.50]Like the fire in my blood
