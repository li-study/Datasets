[00:02.27]You Raise Me Up

[00:59.19]When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
[01:07.24]When troubles come and my heart burdened be
[01:15.73]Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
[01:24.51]Until you come and sit awhile with me
[01:33.13]You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
[01:41.80]You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
[01:50.80]I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
[02:01.61]You raise me up… To more than I can be
[02:09.02]
[02:43.90]You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
[02:51.59]You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
[03:00.16]I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
[03:08.69]You raise me up… To more than I can be
[03:18.37]
[03:21.27]There is no life - no life without its hunger;
[03:29.09]Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
[03:36.73]But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
[03:45.82]Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.
[03:52.61]You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
[04:01.20]You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
[04:08.79]And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
[04:16.31]You raise me up... to more than I can be.
[04:29.48]You raise me up... to more than I can be.
