[00:08.51]To my dear baby!~ 叶建敏~
[00:10.51]I Love You Forever and Ever!~
[00:12.51]
[00:16.00]We were both young when I first saw you
[00:18.00]I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[00:23.00]I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
[00:32.00]See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
[00:36.00]See you make your way to the crowd
[00:40.00]And say hello, little did I know
[00:48.00]That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
[00:52.00]And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
[00:56.00]And I was crying on the staircase
[00:58.00]Begging you please don't go
[01:03.00]And I said,
[01:04.00]"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[01:08.00]I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[01:10.00]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[01:16.00]It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[01:18.00]
[01:23.00]So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[01:28.00]We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
[01:31.00]So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
[01:41.00]'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
[01:44.00]And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
[01:48.00]But you were everything to me
[01:52.00]I was begging you please don't go
[01:55.00]
[01:56.00]And I said,
[01:57.00]"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[02:01.00]I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[02:05.00]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[02:09.00]It's a love story, baby, just say yes
[02:13.00]Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
[02:17.00]This love is difficult, but it's real
[02:21.00]Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[02:25.00]It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[02:30.00]
[02:44.00]I got tired of waiting,
[02:48.00]wondering if you were ever coming around
[02:52.00]My faith in you was fading,
[02:57.00]when I met you on the outskirts of town
[03:00.00]And I said,
[03:01.00]"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
[03:06.00]I keep waiting for you but you never come
[03:09.00]Is this in my head, I don't know what to think"
[03:13.00]He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
[03:16.00]"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone,
[03:18.00]And said,
[03:22.00]I love you and that's all I really know,
[03:25.00]I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress,
[03:29.00]It's a love story, baby, just say yes",
[03:35.00]
[03:45.00]We were both young when I first saw you~~
