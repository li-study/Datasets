[00:00.00]On The Wings Of Love
[00:06.87](Shane):It's good to know
[00:11.34]I'll have your love,
[00:13.84]Which ever way the wind blows
[00:18.73]A guiding light
[00:22.81]That will shine on
[00:26.71]Through the darkest night
[00:29.70](Mark):When the world seems like its full of strangers (full of strangers)
[00:34.93]And I feel as if I've lost my way
[00:40.90]You lift me up on the wings of love
[00:46.78]Taking me higher still with every touch
[00:53.56]Whenever I'm weak, honey
[00:56.97]You take me there again
[01:00.18]On the wings of love
[01:05.75]
[01:09.76](Shane):It's all I need
[01:14.28]When you hold me
[01:16.98]And whisper tenderly
[01:21.86]That I'm the one
[01:25.02]You'll love forever (forever)
[01:29.00]What else could I want
[01:32.35](Mark):In life where we all go through changes
[01:38.29]And when the dreams I have, been swept away
[01:43.95]You lift me up on the wings of love
[01:49.90]Taking me higher still with every touch
[01:56.41]Whenever I'm weak, honey
[02:00.15]You take me there again
[02:03.27]On the wings of love
[02:08.02]Oh
[02:12.02](I'm flying high)
[02:16.85]Its all I need when you hold me close and you whisper tenderly
[02:24.49](Up on the wings of love)
[02:30.14]Higher still with every touch
[02:35.69]Whenever I'm weak, honey
[02:39.05]You take me there again
[02:42.12]On the wings of love
[02:48.13]Oh
[02:49.72]You lift me up on the wings of love (on the wings of love)
[02:57.08]Higher still with every touch (Higher still with every touch)
[03:03.21]Whenever I'm weak, honey
[03:06.13]You take me there again
[03:09.08]On the wings of love
[03:15.61](On the wings of love)
