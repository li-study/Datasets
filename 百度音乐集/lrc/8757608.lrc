[00:01.22]Don't Believe in Love
[00:02.23]Dido
[00:03.14]
[01:25.27]I wanna go to bed with arms around me
[01:28.92]
[01:31.26]But wake up on my own
[01:33.96]
[01:36.80]Pretend that I'm still sleeping
[01:38.89]
[01:42.31]Til' you go home
[01:44.04]
[01:46.39]Oh I can't look at you this morning
[01:49.54]
[01:52.17]I should probably have a sign
[01:54.10]
[01:60.00]That says 'Leave right now or quicker'
[02:02.96]You've overstayed your time
[02:07.45]
[02:10.44]If I don't believe in love nothing will last for me
[02:16.89]
[02:18.08]If I don't believe in love nothing is safe for me
[02:23.49]
[02:25.70]When I don't believe in love you're too close to me
[02:31.54]
[02:32.78]And that's why you have to leave
[02:34.98]
[02:36.50]that's why you have to leave
[02:38.69]
[02:48.41]you're too close to me
[02:54.07]
[03:42.22]Maybe I slept peaceful on your shoulder
[03:45.24]
[03:48.23]Your arm warm around my side
[03:50.81]
[03:54.06]But it's different now, it's morning
[03:56.24]
[03:59.35]And I can't face your smile
[04:01.33]
[04:03.70]The second that I feel your safe hands
[04:09.32]Reaching out for mine
[04:11.55]
[04:17.45]I slip away and out of sight
[04:20.05]You've overstayed your time
[04:22.68]
[04:27.71]If I don't believe in love nothing is good for me
[04:35.14]If I don't believe in love nothing will last for me
[04:42.90]When I don't believe you're getting to close to me
[04:48.39]
[04:49.82]that's why you have to leave
[04:51.72]
[04:53.61]that's why you have to leave
[04:55.65]
[04:57.99]If I don't believe in love nothing will last for me
[05:03.11]
[05:05.65]If I don't believe in love nothing is safe for me
[05:11.26]
[05:13.31]When I don't believe in love you're getting to close to me
[05:18.25]
[05:20.37]that's why you have to leave
[05:22.27]
[05:24.18]that's why you have to leave
