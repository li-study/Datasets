[00:15.25]He spoke my language in this foreign land
[00:22.16]Familiar secrets shared in a sinful bed
[00:29.07]Imagination flowing through his ancient hands
[00:35.96]He painted just my fantasy in red, bright red
[00:42.95]I call him Santa Fe’
[00:50.00]Someone to dance with on a rainy day
[00:56.23]
[00:57.06]He will bring me all the empty reasons to be
[01:03.16]Sure of what I’m only not so sure about
[01:10.03]So can he just be my illusion
[01:17.86]That I created with confusion?
[01:24.89]
[01:38.62]He wears a tall top-hat filled
[01:41.01]with secrets of our souls
[01:45.56]He’ll pull them out as he pulls you
[01:48.57]in through the secret hole
[01:52.60]I call him Santa Fe’
[01:59.49]Someone to bleed with on this lovely day
[02:05.68]
[02:06.65]He will bring me all the empty reasons to be
[02:12.54]Sure of what I’m only not so sure about
[02:19.60]Will he take this grand delusion
[02:27.32]Add his love to make his own conclusion?
[02:34.98]
[02:48.28]True or false can you feel his pulse?
[02:52.25]The warmth he carries really varies
[02:56.41]With the name of the game
[03:02.12]He will bring me all the empty reasons to be
[03:08.16]Sore of what I’m only nt so sure about
[03:16.12]In the end it leads to sudden madness when he
[03:22.15]Takes these reasons breaths some sanity into them
[03:29.23]So can he just be my illusion
[03:36.81]I created with confusion
[03:43.77]Will he take this grand delusion
[03:50.78]Add his love to make his own conclusion
