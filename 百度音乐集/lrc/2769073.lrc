[00:00.00]Blur - Out Of Time
[00:44.85]
[00:46.85]Where's the love song to set us free
[00:53.75]Too many people down
[00:57.21]Everything turning the wrong way round
[01:03.28]
[01:05.86]And I don't know what life would be
[01:12.82]If we stop dreaming now
[01:16.21]Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds
[01:22.06]
[01:23.01]And you've been so busy lately
[01:26.89]that you haven't found the time
[01:30.77]To open up your mind
[01:34.20]And watch the world spinning gently out of time
[01:40.97]
[01:47.25]Feel the sunshine on your face
[01:53.91]It's in a computer now
[01:57.36]Gone to the future way out in space
[02:03.80]
[02:53.81][02:04.22]And you've been so busy lately
[02:57.52][02:07.97]that you haven't found the time
[03:01.35][02:11.77]To open up your mind
[03:04.85][02:15.30]And watch the world spinning gently out of time
[03:11.45][02:22.00]
[03:11.94]Tell me I'm not dreaming
[03:15.13]But are we out of time
[03:19.45]We're out of time
[03:23.02]Out of time
[03:26.27]Out of time
[03:29.69]Out of time
[03:33.09]Out of time
[03:36.29]
