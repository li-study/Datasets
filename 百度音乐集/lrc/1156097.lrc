[00:00.00]Babyface--Simple Days
[00:23.00]I was born on the northside of a midwestern town
[00:28.00]There was nine of us living in a three bedroom house
[00:34.00]Didn't have much money, but we made do
[00:40.00]'Cause Momma worked all day long
[00:43.00]And Daddy did too
[00:46.00]Did all they could
[00:48.00]Made sure we had clothes and food
[00:51.00]Went to public schools and we followed public rules
[00:57.00]We used second hand books
[01:00.00]but oh I didn't mind the books
[01:03.00]Momma taught us early in life
[01:06.00]Everybody's gotta struggle sometime
[01:09.00][02:19.00][03:05.00][03:27.00][03:52.00]Bring back those simple times of yesterday
[01:14.00][02:23.00][03:09.00][03:33.00][03:56.00]When a man was a man
[01:17.00][02:26.00][03:12.00][03:36.00][03:59.00]And a friend was a friend
[01:20.00][02:30.00][03:16.00][03:40.00][04:03.00]Bring back those simple times of yesterday
[01:25.00][02:35.00][03:21.00][03:45.00][04:08.00]When you said what you meant
[01:28.00][02:38.00][03:24.00][03:48.00][04:11.00]And you meant what you said
[01:33.00]Had a friend named Bobby
[01:35.00]Who always kept his word
[01:37.00]We went through schoolyard fights
[01:40.00]Had a thing for pretty girls
[01:43.00]Didn't cost much money
[01:46.00]To see the picture show
[01:49.00]So we hopped the bus into town
[01:52.00]That's where all the girlies used to go
[01:55.00]Fifty cents would buy us popcorn for two
[02:00.00]'Cause Booby's girl she worked there
[02:03.00]And sometimes she'd break the rules
[02:06.00]Picnics in the summer
[02:09.00]Wouldn't wake up 'till noon
[02:12.00]And even though Bobby's gone now
[02:15.00]I can still hear him laugh
[02:17.00]In the middle of June
[02:42.00]Sometimes I sit, I wonder
[02:45.00]I reminisce
[02:47.00]I think of all the good times
[02:50.00]That we had in our lives
[02:53.00]Sometimes I can't get over
[02:56.00]How wonderful those days were
[02:59.00]Back in our lies
[03:01.00]Simple days for simple times
