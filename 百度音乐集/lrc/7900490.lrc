[00:00.00]John Mayer - Come Back To Bed
[00:13.98]
[00:15.98]Still is the life
[00:22.25]Of your room
[00:23.81]When you're not inside
[00:28.62]And all of your things
[00:35.09]Tell the sweetest story line
[00:41.33]Your tears on these sheets
[00:47.64]And your footsteps are down the hall
[00:54.05]So tell me what I did
[00:58.00]I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
[01:03.89]
[01:07.72]You can be mad in the morning
[01:13.70]I'll take back what I said
[01:19.93]Just don't leave me alone here
[01:23.99]It's cold, baby
[01:25.58]Come back to bed
[01:31.88]Come back to bed
[01:38.23]Come back to bed
[01:44.54]Come back to bed
[01:48.60]Come on back to bed
[01:50.54]
[01:53.88]What will this fix?
[02:00.24]You know you're not a quick forgive
[02:06.34]And I won't sleep through this
[02:10.48]I survive on the breath you are finished with
[02:16.32]
[02:20.09]You can be mad in the morning
[02:25.95]I'll take back what I said
[02:32.04]Just don't leave me alone here
[02:36.03]It's cold, baby
[02:37.66]Come back to bed
[02:44.04]Come back to bed
[02:50.06]Come back to bed
[02:56.44]Come back to bed
[02:59.41]
[03:56.01]You can be mad in the morning
[04:02.45]Or the afternoon instead
[04:07.54]But don't leave me
[04:08.90]98 and 6 degrees of seperation from you, baby
[04:13.43]Come back to bed
[04:19.73]Come back to bed
[04:25.74]Come back to bed
[04:31.04]Why don't you come back to bed
[04:34.81]
[04:39.15]Don't hold your love over my head
[04:45.19]Don't hold your love over my head
[04:51.25]Don't hold your love over my head
[04:57.45]Don't hold your love over my head
[05:03.56]Don't hold your love over my head
[05:09.92]Don't hold your love...
