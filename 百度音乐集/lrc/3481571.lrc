[00:02.24]Need You Now
[00:03.28]Lady Antebellum
[00:05.28]
[00:18.59]Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
[00:27.98]Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
[00:35.86]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[00:43.88]For me it happens all the time
[00:49.47]
[00:49.71]It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
[00:58.39]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[01:06.85]And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
[01:18.44]
[01:22.95]Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
[01:31.85]Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
[01:40.28]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[01:48.33]For me it happens all the time
[01:53.84]
[01:53.90]It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[02:03.31]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[02:11.81]And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now
[02:24.03]
[02:26.98]Ooh...
[02:30.16]
[02:35.21]Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
[02:44.67]
[02:44.91]It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
[02:53.90]And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[03:02.85]And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now
[03:15.24]I just need you now
[03:29.54]
[03:33.82]Oh baby I need you now
[03:43.24]
