[00:06.81]Right here
[00:08.48]Something in the dark shot glasses  you know
[00:11.76]Something that you can lean to
[00:13.85]Something that you can ride to
[00:15.79]Something that you can step to
[00:17.38]You know you back
[00:25.34]Sometimes real love can be
[00:27.97]Not seen 'cause you're think
[00:30.74]What's right in front of you
[00:33.43]Can't be the one for you
[00:36.14]Then one day you realize that
[00:38.83]There are feelings that you can't hold back
[00:41.56]And you're so caught up
[00:42.66]Now that's all you think of Crazy how
[01:41.61][00:46.90]All that talk of us not able to last
[01:45.40][00:51.08]Just because of mistakes we made in the past
[01:49.64][00:55.14]But they fail to understand
[02:40.77][01:51.60][00:57.12]I got you And nobody can come to change a thing
[03:07.20][02:45.34][01:55.97][01:01.46]Cause you gotta know You got me
[03:09.79][02:47.82][01:58.63][01:04.13]And it feels so good to have your back now
[03:12.44][02:50.64][02:01.39][01:06.92]I'm so proud
[03:13.57][02:51.77][02:02.60][01:08.06]I got you And if somebody tries to take you from me
[01:12.29]They will see I've got you You got me
[01:18.90]I got you Things are often said to
[01:22.55]Doubt what I feel for you
[01:25.21]But words that people say
[01:27.92]Won't take my love away
[01:30.69]Although it hurts sometimes  it's alright
[01:33.53]But why they say some things that ain't right
[01:36.13]I never know but please understand that baby  it ain't nothing
[02:56.20][02:06.83]They will see I've got you (I got you  baby)

[02:19.80]So that's all that people can do
[02:23.40]Nevermind all the love  all that you
[02:26.05]gotta do is simply love  trust  and just stay...
[02:31.86]Together we'll get through whatever if we
[02:35.68]Don't let speculations make situations up We'll be alright
[03:02.58]I got you
[03:04.33]And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside)
