[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:25.80]What would you do if I told you
[00:33.09]You wouldn't have to worry anymore
[00:41.08]Throw all your scars in the ocean.
[00:48.37]Sink to the floor and disappear forever
[00:53.35]
[00:55.32]Dreaming that's got me by this far
[01:02.68]Without it I'd be lost in the wind
[01:10.14]Some days I can't get out of my own bed
[01:18.06]Others I play along instead
[01:22.59]
[01:24.90]It's been a long time since I forgot about all my crimes
[01:32.10]Walk away from all that drags me down
[01:39.27]Soon I think I'll get hypnotized
[01:46.68]And start a new life
[01:49.40]
[01:55.10]No long delays, don't hesitate, no complicated scenarios
[02:01.71]Let's get right on down to the point
[02:09.52]Don't hold me down, right to the ground,
[02:12.13]let's get unwound and lose that frown
[02:16.56]So much more than we live for
[02:23.63]You got fast forward through all of the bullshit times
[02:30.99]You got to clear out the dust for room to breathe
[02:36.74]
[02:38.73]Stay away from all negativity
[02:45.29]That'll bring you down
[02:47.34]
[02:53.93]Don't let the good sink in to deep in your soul
[02:58.96]You've got to get outside
[03:07.53]It's never too late to make a change in your life
[03:13.37]And to feel alright
[03:17.97]
[03:21.58]You've got to get rid of the old
[03:25.00]And bring the new right on in
[03:31.26]Don't pretend
[03:34.07]Oh give in
[03:38.07]And just get it done
[03:41.76]
