[00:04.97]Jack Johnson
[00:07.60]
[00:14.53]Well based on your smile
[00:19.28]I'm betting all of this
[00:23.55]Might be over soon
[00:26.49]
[00:33.36]But your bound to win
[00:38.03]Cause if I'm betting against you
[00:42.41]I think I'd rather lose
[00:46.51]
[00:51.95]But this is all that I have
[00:56.67]So please
[01:01.14]Take what's left of this heart and use
[01:07.01]Please use only what you really need
[01:13.58]You know I only have so little
[01:15.72]So please
[01:19.95]Mend your broken heart and leave
[01:23.83]
[01:36.56]I know it's not your style
[01:41.02]I can tell by the way that you move
[01:45.63]It's real, real soon
[01:49.74]
[01:55.49]But I'm on your side
[02:00.20]And I don't want to be your regret
[02:04.57]I'd rather be your cocoon
[02:07.49]
[02:14.09]But this is all that you have
[02:18.76]So please
[02:22.92]Let me take what's left of your heart and I will use
[02:29.06]I swear I'll use only what I need
[02:35.61]I know you only have so little
[02:37.92]So please
[02:42.02]Let me mend my broken heart and
[02:45.36]You said this was all you had
[02:48.88]And it's all I need
[02:52.30]But blah blah blah
[02:55.08]Because it fell apart and
[02:58.22]I guess it's all you knew
[03:01.74]And all I have
[03:04.93]But now we have
[03:07.76]Only confused hearts and
[03:10.80]I guess all we have
[03:13.98]Is really all we need
[03:15.80]So please
[03:19.82]Let's take these broken hearts and use
[03:25.85]Let's use only what we really need
[03:32.49]You know we only have so little
[03:34.69]So please
[03:39.16]Take these broken hearts and leave
[03:43.15]
