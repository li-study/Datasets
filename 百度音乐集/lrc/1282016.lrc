[00:10.77]Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
[00:19.98]That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
[00:29.03]I'll be she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
[00:33.85]And she's got everything that I have to live without
[00:38.94]Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
[00:49.36]That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
[00:57.87]He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
[01:02.60]I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
[01:07.77]He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[01:12.12]The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
[01:16.92]He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[01:23.36]
[01:27.58]Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
[01:36.78]And there he goes, so perfectly,
[01:42.16]The kind of flawless I wish I could be
[01:45.71]She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
[01:51.00]Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause
[01:55.70]He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[02:00.15]The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
[02:04.94]He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[02:11.21]
[02:24.21]So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
[02:28.88]I'll put his picture down and maybe
[02:31.69]Get some sleep tonight
[02:33.82]He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[02:39.04]The only one that's got enough of me to break my heart
[02:43.66]He's the song in the car I keep singing
[02:47.00]Don't know why I do
[02:52.00]He's the time taken up
[02:53.97]But there's never enough
[02:56.75]And he's all that I need to fall into
[03:03.55]Drew looks at me
[03:08.40]I fake a smile so he won't see
[03:14.18]
