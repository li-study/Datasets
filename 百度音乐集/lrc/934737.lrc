[02:12.07]Maria, hear my prayer
[02:20.29]Today I'm asking for forgiveness
[02:28.86]For all my people here on earth
[02:37.56]I know they feel inside their hearts
[02:45.37]What is wrong or right
[02:50.96]True love is all it needs to heal them
[02:59.55]But hate is all they really know
[03:08.10]So innocent the starving children
[03:16.92]How I wish they'd get a chance to grow
[03:26.16]Ave Maria
