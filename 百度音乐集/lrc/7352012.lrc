[05:38.53]Never is the sun
[05:40.23]Never
[05:46.44]
[05:47.01]To begin whipping dance of the dead
[05:50.29]Blackened is the end
[05:52.60]To begin whipping dance of the dead
[05:56.25]Is the outcome of hypocrisy
[05:59.77]Darkest potency
[06:02.09]In the exit of humanity
[06:04.79]Color our world blackened
[06:07.06]Blackened
