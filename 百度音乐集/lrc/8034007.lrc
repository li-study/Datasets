[00:15.31]It's a crime you let it happen to me
[00:19.46]Never mind, I'll let it happen to you
[00:23.44]I don't mind, forget it, there's nothing to lose
[00:27.47]But my mind and all the things I wanted
[00:31.00]
[00:31.59]Every time I get it I throw it away
[00:35.46]It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay
[00:39.42]By the time I lose it I'm not afraid
[00:43.46]I'm alive but I can surely fake it
[00:47.40]
[00:48.00]How can I believe
[00:50.81]When this cloud hangs over me
[00:54.86]You're the part of me
[00:57.45]That I don't wanna see
[00:59.80]
[01:00.59]Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
[01:04.65]Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
[01:08.72]Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
[01:12.70]Forget it, forget it
[01:14.18]
[01:15.56]There's a place I see you following me
[01:19.52]Just a taste of all that might come to be
[01:23.54]I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
[01:27.62]To question every answer counted
[01:31.87]
[01:32.99]Just fade away
[01:37.77]Please me let me stay
[01:41.91]Caught in your way  (forget it, forget it, forget it)
[01:47.21]
[01:48.84]Just fade away
[01:53.76]Please me let me stay
[01:57.87]Caught in your way (forget it, forget it, forget it)
[02:02.80]
[02:03.65]It's a crime you let it happen to me
[02:07.45]I don't mind, I love it, easy to please
[02:11.52]Never mind, forget it, just memory
[02:15.51]On a page inside a spiral notebook
[02:20.00]
[02:36.77]Just fade away
[02:41.70]Please let me stay
[02:45.78]Caught in your way
[02:49.54]I can live forever here
[02:52.05]
[02:52.94]Just fade away
[02:57.75]Please let me stay
[03:01.85]Caught in your way
[03:05.40]I can live forever here
[03:07.99]How can I believe
[03:10.88]When this cloud hangs over me
[03:14.86]You're the part of me
[03:17.45]That I don't wanna see
[03:21.25]I can live forever here
[03:24.61]
