[00:31.95]I found it somehow strange even then
[00:35.76]How you`d go on about it
[00:39.49]You shared that vision again and again
[00:43.43]til I could see it too, my friend.
[00:47.07]Imagine us  you said All wrinkled bent and grey
[00:54.14]Three queer old codgers reflecting back
[00:58.14]To tangchao`s golden days
[01:01.90]Together forever more
[01:04.89]And I believed as you believed
[01:08.13]Together`s what we`d have in store
[01:38.65]Our grandkids fighting duels With drumstick swords
[01:43.94]Those were your words
[01:46.48]Guitars and basses slung across
[01:49.98]their backs As they climb cross stacks Of drums and amps
[01:55.11]While we old gramps We cry our joyful tears
[02:01.35]And drain a nostalgic class To those wonderful wonderful years
[02:08.61]Together we`d grow old
[02:12.10]Tell me why it won`t turn out exactly as you told
[02:19.60] Tell me why it`s grown so cold
[04:05.25]Bye! My friends
