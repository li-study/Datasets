[00:20.96]I tried to play it cool
[00:25.01]pretending that you're not on my mind
[00:30.17]For so long I've been the fool
[00:34.07]But it ain't gonna happen this time.
[00:36.82]
[00:39.50]Every day, every night
[00:41.25]all I do is sit and think about you
[00:44.05]It goes on endlessly
[00:49.01]There's no way I can't deny
[00:50.64]Everything I feel inside
[00:53.20]I want to show you
[00:55.35]I need to hold you
[00:57.59]'Cause words are not enough
[01:00.81]
[01:01.31]I'm in it for love
[01:03.69]I'm in it for you
[01:05.95]I love everything you say and do
[01:10.67]You're all that I need
[01:12.97]I want you to see that I
[01:16.26]Can't wait another minute
[01:18.81]'Cause you know I'm in it for love
[01:22.24](you know I'm in it for love baby)
[01:26.88](you know I am)
[01:29.28](just look inside your heart)
[01:30.76]
[01:31.64]You're trying to play it cool
[01:35.64]Keepin' me runnin' around
[01:41.33]Don't think I'm gonna give it up
[01:44.54]'Cause that ain't the way it's gonna go down
[01:47.40]
[01:50.11]Every day, every night
[01:51.68]all I do is sit and think about you
[01:54.66]It goes on endlessly
[01:59.50]There's no way I can't deny

[02:52.85]That's why I'm in it for you
[02:56.67]And I swear I'm in it for love
