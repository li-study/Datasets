[00:09.56]My baby's riding shotgun
[00:11.69]Singin just a little off key
[00:17.90]Her feet on the dashboard
[00:20.13]Tapping out the back beat
[00:26.50]The song on the radio's
[00:28.75]Is talking about the love we make
[00:34.80]I know just what she's thinking
[00:37.82]And I can't wait

[00:56.81](Keep singing, love, keep singing)
[01:00.27]
[01:00.59]Her tanline's showing
[01:02.48]Out the waist of her cutoff jeans
[01:08.79]Her damp hair blowing out the window
[01:11.85]In the summer breeze
[01:16.94]Got the sunshine
[01:18.50]Shining through the windshield
[01:21.05]Got a hand on her leg
[01:23.54]The other on the wheel
[01:25.44]
[01:25.93]Oh my sweet love

[01:42.51]
[01:43.51]Oh and when we get together
[01:46.94]The love we make together
[01:49.27]It blows my mind
[01:51.29]Every time we touch
[01:55.63]Oh I can't get enough
[01:57.89]
[02:14.86]So slide on in a little closer
[02:18.93]And lay your head here on my shoulder
[02:24.41]
