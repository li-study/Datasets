[00:14.96]I could hardly believe it
[00:17.48]When I heard the news today
[00:21.28]I had to come and get it straight from you
[00:28.87]They said you were leavin
[00:31.03]Someone swept you heart away
[00:34.77]From the look upon your face I see it's true
[00:41.57]So tell me all about it,

[01:33.84]I didn't come here for cryin
[01:35.86]Didn't come here to breakdown
[01:39.49]It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
[01:47.37]And how can I blame you
[01:49.66]When I built my world around
[01:52.48]The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends
[02:00.30]And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
[02:07.59]Even now it's more than I can take
