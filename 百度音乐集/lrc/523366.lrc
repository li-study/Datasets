[00:05.64]Matisyahu
[00:08.09]
[00:14.33]sometimes I lay
[00:16.04]under the moon
[00:17.94]and thank God I'm breathing
[00:21.23]then I pray
[00:22.67]don't take me soon
[00:24.33]cause i'm here for a reason
[00:27.02]sometimes in my tears I drown
[00:29.93]but I never let it get me down
[00:33.10]so when negativity surrounds
[00:36.45]I know some day it'll all turn around
[00:39.68]because all my live I've been waiting for
[00:43.08]I've been praying for
[00:44.65]for the people to say
[00:46.85]that we dont wanna fight no more
[00:49.65]they'll be no more wars
[00:51.39]and our children will play

[01:08.96]win or lose
[01:10.74]we all lose
[01:12.14]when they feed on the souls of the innocent
[01:14.85]blood drenched pavement
[01:16.51]keep on moving though the waters stay raging
[01:20.91]in this maze you can lose your way (your way)
[01:25.94]it might drive you crazy but dont let it faze you no way (no way)
[01:33.11]sometimes in my tears I drown
[01:36.13]but I never let it get me down
[01:39.30]so when negativity surrounds
