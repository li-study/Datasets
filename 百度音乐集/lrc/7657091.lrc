[00:10.24]Hypnotherapist:
[00:10.54]\close your eyes and begin to relax. take a deep breath, and let it out slowly.
[00:16.27]concentrate on your breathing. with each breath you become more relaxed.
[00:22.55] imagine a brilliant white light above you
[00:25.36], focusing on this light as it flows through your body.
[00:28.97]allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind.
[00:35.68]now as i count backward from ten to one, you will
[00:37.42]Feel more peaceful, and calm. ten. nine. eight. seven. six.
[00:47.75]you will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. five. four. three. two.
[00:57.96]if at any time you need to come back, all you must do
[01:02.49]En your eyes. one.
[01:03.80]Nicholas:
[01:05.11]Safe in the light that surrounds me
[01:11.52]Free of the fear and the pain
[01:18.12]My subconscious mind
[01:20.92]Starts spinning through time
[01:24.15]To rejoin the past once again
[01:31.31]Nothing seems real
[01:34.28]I'm starting to feel
[01:37.34]Lost in the haze of a dream
[01:44.49]And as i draw near
[01:47.53]The scene becomes clear
[01:50.95]Like watching my life on a screen
[01:57.80]Hello victoria so glad to see you
[02:03.27]My friend.
