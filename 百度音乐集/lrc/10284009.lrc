[00:00.27]Prayer
[00:01.76]Secret garden
[00:02.22]
[00:03.22]Let your arms enfold us
[00:09.29]Through the dark of night
[00:15.19]Will your angels hold us
[00:21.14]Till we see the light
[00:26.13]
[00:51.02]Hush, lay down your troubled mind
[01:02.12]The day has vanished and left us behind
[01:13.75]And the wind, whispering soft lullabies
[01:26.30]Will soothe, so close your weary eyes 
[01:34.06]
[01:42.33]Let your arms enfold us
[01:48.28]Through the dark of night
[01:54.23]Will your angels hold us
[02:00.15]Till we see the light
[02:04.99]
[02:30.00]Sleep, angels will watch over you
[02:41.29]And soon beautiful dreams will come true
[02:52.74]Can you feel spirits embracing your soul
[03:05.37]So dream while secrets of darkness unfold 
[03:13.15] 
[03:18.37]Let your arms enfold us
[03:23.91]Through the dark of night
[03:30.26]Will your angels hold us
[03:36.10]Till we see the light
[03:40.75]
[03:42.26]Let your arms enfold us
[03:48.18]Through the dark of night
[03:54.24]Will your angels hold us
[04:00.11]Till we see the light
[04:05.21]
