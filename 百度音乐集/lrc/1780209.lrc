[00:04.11]Adele
[00:04.85]
[00:07.49]I've made up my mind,
[00:10.02]Don't need to think it over,
[00:13.10]if I'm wrong I am right,
[00:16.13]Don't need to look no further,
[00:19.03]This ain't lust,
[00:20.99]I know this is love but,
[00:29.79]If I tell the world,
[00:32.65]I'll never say enough,
[00:35.10]Cause it was not said to you,
[00:37.91]And thatâ€™s exactly what I need to do,
[00:41.67]If I'm in love with you,
[00:48.02]Should I give up,
[00:50.07]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[00:54.14]Even if it leads nowhere,
[00:58.55]Or would it be a waste?
[01:00.90]Even If I knew my place
[01:03.91]Should I leave it there?
[01:07.22]Should I give up
[01:09.54]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[01:13.82]Even if it leads nowhere.
[01:22.64]I'd build myself up,
[01:25.26]And fly around in circles,
[01:27.86]Wait then as my heart drops,
[01:30.86]And my back begins to tingle
[01:33.90]Finally could this be it, Or
[01:40.73]Should I give up,
[01:42.55]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[01:46.62]Even if it leads nowhere,
[01:51.02]Or would it be a waste?
[01:53.41]Even If I knew my place
[01:56.34]Should I leave it there?
[01:59.80]Should I give up
[02:01.97]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[02:06.25]Even if it leads nowhere.
[02:15.15]Should I give up,
[02:17.16]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[02:20.34]Even if it leads nowhere,
[02:25.97]Or would it be a waste?
[02:28.63]Even If I knew my place
[02:31.97]Should I leave it there?
[02:34.90]Should I give up
[02:38.09]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[02:44.25]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[02:50.87]Should I give up,
[02:56.23]Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
[03:00.14]Even if it leads nowhere,
[03:04.51]Or would it be a waste?
[03:07.70]Even If I knew my place
[03:09.94]Should I leave it there?
