[00:11.19]
[00:13.19]Spoken: You're perfect.
[00:14.44]
[01:11.49]I just can't control myself,
[01:14.90]I can't be with no one else,
[01:17.17]Seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
[01:23.21]I don't think they understand,
[01:26.42]Why I love at your command,
[01:28.83]From the words you speak,
[01:30.27]So deep about it's need I have to have you,
[01:35.03]
[01:36.67]I love you, you're perfect,
[01:42.11]A manifestation of my dreams,
[01:48.17]You make my body feel,
[01:54.41]About a million different things
[01:57.69]
[01:59.88]I think God made you for me,
[02:02.68]A mix of passionate fidelities,
[02:07.19]Baby you're so complete,
[02:11.49]I write this song to let you know,
[02:15.12]That you will always be
[02:17.21]My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king
[02:23.38]
[02:24.82]I love you, you're perfect,
[02:30.56]A manifestation of my dreams,
[02:36.46]You make my body feel,
[02:42.67]About a million different things
[02:47.86]
[02:48.40]There's no way I'd leave you
[02:54.46]It is not a reality,
[02:59.86]Sometimes I feel like I'm
[03:06.65]Living in a fantasy.
