[00:08.44]by yukiko.kosmo.cn
[00:18.19]A couple seasons psssed me by
[00:22.44]Since you made me feel so real
[00:26.52]That feeling I remember
[00:30.20]It was as good as can be
[00:34.18]I haven’t seen you for a while
[00:38.22]I wonder if you’re well
[00:42.23]What’s going on in your mind?
[00:46.26]I really would like to see
[00:49.21]
[00:50.56]I try to think but it won’t do
[00:54.01]It’s taking time to get near
[00:58.25]Some things are hard to explain
[01:02.28]I wonder can I tell you?
[01:06.17]We haven’t been taking much
[01:10.11]It doesen’t mean I don’t care
[01:14.27]Should I just call you to say
[01:17.99]I’m falling and I miss you
[01:22.08]oooh hoo
[01:24.43]Wish I was with you in my dreams
[01:28.50]and I'm praying to be your side
[01:34.10]and suddenly you'll slip away
[01:37.06]
[01:38.20]oooh hoo
[01:40.48]Easy as flowing down the stream
[01:44.41]Do you know that?
[01:46.31]Will you understand me?
[01:50.30]Why is it you make me wait so long?
[01:57.30]
[02:10.35]Sometimes do you think of me
[02:14.61]as much as I think of you
[02:18.54]I'd like to know when you dream
[02:22.29]Am I there?
[02:23.05]Do you miss me?
[02:24.90]
[02:26.40]I know you can't share life with me
[02:30.14]and I don't know what to do
[02:33.97]but if you walk right thru my door,
[02:38.23]you will see that I miss you
[02:40.90]
[02:42.04]In my heart
[02:43.96]I want you
[02:45.90]to know that
[02:47.70]I miss you
[02:50.05]In my heart
[02:52.04]I want you
[02:54.06]to know that
[02:56.35]I miss you
[02:57.80]In my heart
[02:59.63]I want you
[03:02.05]to know that
[03:03.79]I miss you
[03:05.56]In my heart
[03:08.15]I want you
[03:10.08]to know that
[03:12.10]I miss you
[03:14.16]
[03:16.81]I miss you
[03:20.74]I miss you
