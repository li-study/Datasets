[00:05.76]Changing Partner
[00:07.34]
[00:10.96]We were waltzing together
[00:14.99]to a dreamy melody
[00:19.11]When they called out "Change partner!"
[00:23.48]And you waltz away from me
[00:27.62]Now my arms feel so empty
[00:32.05]As I gazed around the floor
[00:36.53]And I keep on changing partners
[00:40.65]Till I hold you once more
[00:44.88]Though we danced for one moment
[00:49.09]And too soon we had to part
[00:53.37]In that wonderful moment
[00:57.61]Something happened to my heart
[01:01.90]So I keep changing partners
[01:06.39]Till you're in my arms, and then
[01:10.94]Oh my daring
[01:12.97]I will never change partner again
[01:19.24]Music...
[01:53.81]Though we danced for one moment
[01:58.34]And too soon we had to part
[02:02.63]In that wonderful moment
[02:06.55]Something happened to my heart
[02:10.74]So I keep changing partners
[02:15.12]Till you're in my arms, and then
[02:19.51]Oh my daring
[02:22.17]I will never change partner again
