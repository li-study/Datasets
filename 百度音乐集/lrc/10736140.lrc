[00:14.59]I found out what I've been missing
[00:20.78]Always on the run
[00:25.76]I've been looking for someone
[01:52.57][00:36.60]Now you're here like you've been before
[01:57.93][00:41.80]And you know just what I need
[02:04.07][00:48.15]It took some time for me to see
[03:10.26][02:14.79][00:58.82]That you give good love to me baby
[03:39.05][03:15.25][02:20.31][01:02.76]So good, take this heart mine into your hands

[01:30.62]Never stopping, I was always searching
[01:36.86]For that perfect love
[01:42.01]The kind that girls like me dream of
[02:45.28]
[02:45.94]Now I, I can't stop looking around
[02:53.64]It's not, what this loves all about
[03:00.55]Our love is here to stay, stay
