[00:29.93]Can you stand and kneel?
[00:32.30]Marching forward hypocritic
[00:34.64]and hypnotic computers.
[00:37.08]You depend on our protection,

[01:10.45]kneeling roses disappearing,
[01:12.69]into Moses’ dry mouth,
[01:14.98]breaking into Fort Knox,
[01:16.74]stealing our intentions,
[01:19.73]every city gripped in oil,
[01:21.92]Crying FREEDOM!
[01:24.18]
[01:24.51]Handed to absolution,
[01:26.83]Still you feed us lies from the table cloth.

[02:44.31]
[02:44.67]Kneeling roses disappearing,
[02:46.53]into Moses’ dry mouth,
[02:48.78]breaking into Fort Knox,
[02:50.57]stealing our intentions,
[02:53.62]every city gripped in oil,
[02:56.07]Crying FREEDOM!
[02:58.24]Handed to absolution,
