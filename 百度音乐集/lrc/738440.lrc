[00:14.30]Music is playing in the darkness
[00:17.39]And a lantern goes swinging by
[00:21.41]Shadows flickering my heart\'s jittering
[00:24.97]Just you and I
[00:28.68]Not tonight come tomorrow
[00:32.12]When ev\'rything\'s sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
[00:35.93]No no no come tomorrow \'cause then
[00:39.50]We\'ll be waiting in the moonlight
[00:42.04]We\'ll go walking in the moonlight
[00:49.71]Walking in the moonlight
[00:56.54]Laughter ringing in the darkness
[00:59.87]People drinking for days gone by
[01:03.66]Time don\'t mean a thing
[01:05.98]When you\'re by my side
[01:07.83]Please stay awhile
[01:10.79]
[01:11.22]You know I never could forsee the future years
[01:18.46]You know I never could see
[01:22.19]Where life was leading me
[01:25.55]But will we be together forever?
[01:32.02]What will be my love?
[01:33.93]Can\'t you see that I just don\'t know

[02:15.70]Walking in the moonlight
[02:22.33]I can hear the music in the darkness
[02:25.89]Floating softly to where we lie
[02:29.95]No more questions now
[02:32.28]Let\'s enjoy tonight
[02:33.83](Just you and I) just you and I
