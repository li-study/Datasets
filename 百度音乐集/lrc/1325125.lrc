[00:00.00]Is It Any Wonder?
[00:02.30]Keane-Under The Iron Sea
[00:04.65]
[00:24.59]I
[00:26.49]I always thought that I knew
[00:30.24]I'd always have the right to
[00:33.97]Be living in the kingdom of the good and true
[00:39.09]And so on
[00:41.39]But now I think I was wrong
[00:45.12]And you were laughing along
[00:48.83]And now I look a fool for thinking you were on, my side
[00:55.61]
[00:56.36]Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
[00:59.94]Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
[01:03.71]Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?
[01:08.33]
[01:09.19]Sometimes
[01:11.10]It's hard to know where I stand
[01:14.62]It's hard to know where I am
[01:18.49]Or maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand
[01:24.80]Sometimes
[01:26.69]I get the feeling that I'm
[01:29.66]Stranded in the wrong time
[01:33.40]Where love is just a lyric in children's rhyme, a soundbite
[01:39.94]
[01:40.77]Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
[01:44.52]Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
[01:48.21]Is it any wonder I don't know what's right
[01:52.89]Oh these days?
[01:55.61]After all the misery you made
[01:59.57]Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
[02:03.09]Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?
[02:06.48]
[02:08.65]Nothing left beside this old cathedral
[02:15.16]Just the sad lonely spires
[02:19.20]How do you make it right?
[02:21.47]
[02:22.95]Oh but you try
[02:25.32]Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
[02:28.98]Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
[02:32.74]Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?
[02:37.26]Oh these days
[02:40.10]After all the misery you made
[02:43.81]Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
[02:47.56]Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?
