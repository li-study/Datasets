[00:02.12]Miracle (Michael Cassette Remix)

[00:06.04]
[02:32.35]Don't they know that there's something going on
[02:39.77]What they're harming with their indecision
[02:48.11]But who will be left standing when I'm gone?
[02:55.04]There'll be nothing left but a vision
[03:02.31]It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
[03:09.59]It's too easy to bow your head and pray
[03:17.12]There are some times when you should try to find your voice
[03:24.97]This is one voice that you must find today
[03:30.68]
[04:14.48]Are you hoping for a miracle?
[04:22.13]As the ice caps melt away?
[04:30.21]No use hoping for a miracle
[04:37.86]There's a price we'll have to pay
[04:44.56]Don’t they know there’s something they can do?
[04:51.34]To be sure of tomorrow’s tomorrow
[04:59.64]And too late, too late for me and you
[05:06.62]No more time left for you tomorrow
[05:13.82]It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
[05:21.25]It's too easy to bow your head and pray
[05:28.62]There are some times when you should try to find your voice
[05:36.51]This is one voice that you must find today
[05:42.35]
[06:08.89]Are you hoping for a miracle?
[06:16.38]As the ice caps melt away?
[06:24.58]No use hoping for a miracle
[06:31.65]There’s a price we’ll have to pay
