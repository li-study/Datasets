[00:00.00]Blues From A Gun-The Jesus And Mary Chain
[00:28.07]I don't care about the state of my hair
[00:31.52]I got something out of nothing
[00:33.57]That just wasn't there
[00:35.26]And your kiss kiss kiss
[00:37.09]Is never gonna blow me away
[00:43.32]Dreams of escape keep me awake
[00:47.51]I'm never gonna get out and make it away
[00:50.81]I'm a stone dead tripper
[00:53.20]Dying in a fantasy
[00:58.58]Like a cracked open sky it helps you to die
[01:02.52]Don't split it scrape it
[01:04.51]You're screaming automatic pain
[01:11.25]Too young kid you're gonna get hit
[01:14.20]Looks like your never gonna make it
[01:16.82]Off the government list
[01:53.45]I don't mind about the state of my mind
[01:56.70]But you know it's good for nothing
[01:58.89]And I left you behind
[02:00.75]It's a sick sick city
[02:02.67]But it's never gonna make me insane
[02:08.16]If you're talking for real
[02:10.26]Then go cut a deal
[02:12.40]You're facing up to living out
[02:15.06]The way that you feel
[02:16.99]And you shake shake shake
[02:18.26]'Cause you know you'll never make it away
[02:23.73]Like a cracked open sky it helps you to die
[02:27.85]Don't split it scrape it
[02:29.65]You're screaming automatic pain
[02:35.58]Too young kid you're gonna get hit
[02:39.53]Looks like your never gonna make it
[02:42.39]Off the government list
[03:06.48]Well I guess that's why I've always
[03:10.20]Got the blues
[03:14.06]Well I guess that's why I've always
[03:17.25]Got the blues
[03:21.71]Well I guess that's why I've always
