[00:30.72]You and me
[00:34.24]Meant to be
[00:37.94]Immutable
[00:41.44]Impossible
[00:44.89]It\'s destiny
[00:48.48]Pure lunacy
[00:52.05]Incalculable
[00:55.61]Inseparable
[00:58.55]But for the last time

[01:05.04]That I want and ask for
[01:09.57]You\'re all that I dreamed
[01:16.49]Who wouldn\'t be the one you love
[01:23.52]Who wouldn\'t stand inside your love
[01:30.45]Protected and the lover of
[01:36.12]A pure soul and beautiful you
[01:43.47]
[01:50.14]Don\'t understand
[01:53.66]Don\'t feel me now
[01:57.17]I will breathe
[02:00.87]For the both of us
[02:04.20]Travel the world
[02:07.74]Traverse the skies
[02:11.19]Your home is here
[02:14.78]Within my heart
[02:17.78]And for the first time
[02:21.80]I feel as though I am reborn
[02:26.34]In my mind
[02:28.84]Recast as child and mystic sage
[02:35.78]Who wouldn\'t be the one you love
[02:42.69]Who wouldn\'t stand inside your love
[02:47.08]
[03:13.21]And for the first time
[03:17.01]I\'m telling you how much
[03:19.75]I need and bleed for
[03:23.80]Your every move and waking sound
[03:28.24]In my time
[03:30.75]I\'ll wrap wire around your heart And your mind
[03:37.60]You\'re mine forever now
[03:44.35]Who wouldn\'t be the one you love
[03:48.78]And live for
[03:51.26]Who wouldn\'t stand inside your love
[03:55.47]And die for
[03:57.94]Who wouldn\'t be the one you love
