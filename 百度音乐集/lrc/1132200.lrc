[00:08.48]搜啦EP
[00:14.70]Tired
[00:17.21]Of everything around me
[00:21.47]I smile
[00:24.07]But I don\'t feel a thing ~no
[01:19.71][00:28.14]I\'m so far from where I need to be
[01:23.16][00:31.68]I\'ve given up on faith, on everything
[00:35.50]All I want, all I need
[00:39.01]Is some peace
[02:39.38][02:25.09][01:33.88][00:43.09]There\'s a hole
[02:43.10][02:28.44][01:37.34][00:46.68]Inside of me
[02:31.90][00:50.55]It\'s so cold
[02:49.85][02:35.39][01:44.44][00:53.63]Slowly killing me
[01:05.72]Secrets (Secrets)
[01:08.41]Eating at the core of me
[01:12.23]Shut off (You shut off)
[01:15.70]Trusting all the lies I breathe
[01:27.01]All I wanted, all I needed
[01:30.51]Was some peace
[02:46.42][01:40.95]It\'s so damn cold
[01:55.13]Sinking ever so slowly
[01:58.74]So far from where I should be
[02:02.08]No hands reaching out for me
[02:05.77]Help me, help me
[02:10.52]Something\'s gone
[02:14.24]I can feel it
[02:17.73]It\'s all wrong
[02:21.09]I\'m so sick of this
