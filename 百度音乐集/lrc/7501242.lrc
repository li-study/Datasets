[00:20.20]Once upon a time my friends it feels like yesterday
[00:24.67]I was living lonesome in a world of disarray
[00:29.08]Everything was black and white,there wasn't even gray
[00:33.41]And every morning waking up on Groundhog Day
[00:37.47]
[00:38.25]It was all in monochrome,without the light,
[00:42.65]Just like a silver screen you walked into my life
[00:46.71]
[00:47.19]You taught the stars to light up what was dark
[00:51.65]I found the light saturated in your charm
[00:56.06]We kiss the sky and dance across rainbows
[01:00.51]Now it's all in technicolor with you
[01:05.72]
[01:13.79]I lived in the blackest house with seven pure white cats
[01:17.96]The bleak eyed look of every day hidden deep inside my hat
[01:22.33]The notes on the piano now remind me of my past
[01:26.65]And now you're here right by my side,I hope that we will last
[01:30.80]
[01:31.57]It was all in monochrome,without the light,
[01:36.08]Just like a silver screen you walked into my life
[01:40.09]
[01:40.58]You taught the stars to light up what was dark
[01:44.98]I found the light saturated in your charm
[01:49.43]We kiss the sky and dance across rainbows
[01:53.86]Now it's all in technicolor with you
[01:58.86]
[01:59.50]Yellow,orange,pink,green and blue
[02:02.96]Let's paint the town,darling us two
[02:07.24]You bring your pallet and I will sing the sub bar
[02:11.76]We're just two birds of a feather
[02:15.24]
[02:16.06]You taught the stars to light up what was dark
[02:20.64]I found the light saturated in your charm
[02:25.06]We kiss the sky and dance across rainbows
[02:29.40]Now it's all in technicolor with you
[02:33.70]
[02:34.11]You taught the stars to light up what was dark
[02:38.45]I found the light saturated in your charm
[02:42.79]We kiss the sky and dance across rainbows
[02:47.23]Now it's all in technicolor with you
[02:51.89]
[02:52.66]Now it's all in technicolor with you
[02:57.26]
