[00:01.21]Father And Son
[00:03.93]Boyzone
[00:05.97]
[00:12.77]It's not time to make a change
[00:16.09]Just relax take it easy
[00:19.44]You're still young that's your fault
[00:22.60]There's so much you have to know
[00:25.75]Find a girl, settle down
[00:29.21]If you want, you can marry
[00:32.24]Look at me I am old
[00:35.75]But I'm happy
[00:37.09]
[00:39.11]I was once like you are now
[00:42.48]And I know that it's not easy
[00:45.83]To become when you've found
[00:48.70]Something going on
[00:52.20]But take your time think a lot
[00:55.56]Think of everthing you've got
[00:58.46]For you will still be here tomorrow
[01:02.13]But your dreams may not
[01:04.72]
[01:09.45]How can I try to explain?
[01:12.92]When I do it turns away again
[01:16.21]And it's always been the same
[01:19.38]Same old story
[01:22.47]From the moment I could talk
[01:26.05]I was ordered to listen
[01:28.32]Now there's a way, and I know
[01:32.42]That I have to go away
[01:36.04]I know, I have to go
[01:39.08]
[01:44.77]It's not time to make a change
[01:47.97]Just sit down
[01:49.49]and take it slowly
[01:51.31]You're still young that's your fault
[01:54.45]There's so much you have to go through
[01:57.62]Find a girl, settle down
[02:00.97]If you want, you can marry
[02:04.29]Look at me I am old
[02:07.67]But I'm happy
[02:09.10]
[02:10.86]All the times, that I've cried
[02:14.29]Keeping all the things I knew inside
[02:17.51]And it's hard
[02:19.45]But it's harder to ignore it
[02:22.38]
[02:23.95]If they were right I'd agree
[02:27.66]But it's them they know
[02:29.25]Not me. Now there's a way, and I know
[02:34.00]That I have to go away
[02:37.58]I know, I have to go.
