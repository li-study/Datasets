[00:12.58]Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yeh.
[00:17.72]

[00:24.66]
[00:27.91]Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,
[00:31.22]walkin' along the river road at night,
[00:34.72]barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight.
[00:38.59]
[00:41.60]I can hear the bull frog callin' me.
[00:44.72]
[00:48.35]Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.
[00:51.91]
[00:55.16]Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water,
[00:58.54]shoe fly, dragon fly, get back t your mother.

[01:36.42]
[01:39.23]with flat car riders and cross-tie walkers.
