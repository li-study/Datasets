[00:16.95]well are there any other kind of lovers?
[00:30.83]Fools in love,
[00:36.37]is there any other kind of pain?
[00:50.20]Everything you do, everywhere you go now
[00:54.82]Everything you touch, everything you feel
[00:59.66]Everything you see, everything you know now
[01:04.74]Everything you do, you do it for your bady

[02:29.75]Fools in love they think they're heroes
[02:34.79]'Cause they get to feel no pain
[02:39.36]I say fools in love are zeros
[02:43.76]I should know, I should know
[02:48.49]Because this fool's in love again
[03:02.35]Fools in love,
[03:08.66]gently hold each others hands forever
[03:22.63]Fools in love,
[03:29.30]gently tear each other limb from limb

[03:47.29]Everything you touch, everything you feel
[03:52.36]Everything you do, even your rock 'n' roll now
[03:57.50]Nothing mean a thing except you and your bady
[04:01.70]Love your bady, love your bady
[04:06.71]Love your bady, love...

[04:27.46]I should know, I should know
[04:32.41]Because this fool's in love again
