[00:19.76]A city freeze
[00:21.95]Get on your knees
[00:24.49]Pray for warmth and green paper.
[00:29.29]A city drought
[00:30.88]You're down and out
[00:34.13]See your trousers don't taper.
[00:38.76]Saddle up
[00:40.98]Kick your feet
[00:44.10]Ride the range of a London street
[00:48.31]Travel to a local plane
[00:53.01]Turn around and come back again.
[01:02.13]And at the chime of the city clock
[01:04.94]Put up your road block
[01:07.26]Hang on to your crown.
[01:11.31]For a stone in a tin can
[01:14.19]Is wealth to the city man
[01:17.04]Who leaves his armour down.
[01:32.01]Stay indoors
[01:33.94]Beneath the floors
[01:36.45]Talk with neighbours only.
[01:40.68]The games you play
[01:42.43]Make people say
[01:45.36]You're either weird or lonely.
[01:50.33]A city star
[01:52.58]Won't shine too far
[01:55.92]On account of the way you are
[02:00.08]And the beads
[02:02.18]Around your face
[02:04.83]Make you sure to fit back in place.
[02:14.15]And at the beat of the city drum
[02:17.07]See how your friends come in twos;
[02:19.89]Or threes or more.
[02:23.28]For the sound of a busy place
[02:26.29]Is fine for a pretty face
[02:28.78]Who knows what a face is for.
[03:00.13]The city clown
[03:03.17]Will soon fall down
[03:04.93]Without a face to hide in.
[03:09.53]And he will lose
[03:11.74]If he won't choose
[03:14.71]The one he may confide in.
[03:19.12]Sonny boy
[03:21.49]With smokes for sale
[03:24.38]Went to ground with a face so pale
[03:28.75]And never heard
[03:31.19]About the change
[03:33.55]Showed his hand and fell out of range.
[03:42.50]In the light of a city square
[03:45.81]Find out the face that's fair
[03:48.44]Keep it by your side.
[03:52.04]When the light of the city falls
[03:55.13]You fly to the city walls
[03:57.78]Take off with your bride.
[04:01.57]But at the chime of a city clock
[04:05.15]Put up your road block
[04:07.37]Hang on to your crown.
[04:11.62]For a stone in a tin can
[04:14.68]Is wealth to the city man
[04:17.32]Who leaves his armour down.
