[00:58.07]The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
[01:05.78]Screaming she moans, "I've just been made"
[01:10.04]Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
[01:13.69]Says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"
[01:17.11]
[01:19.00]Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
[01:24.54]He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride

[05:09.01]
[05:12.26]Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
