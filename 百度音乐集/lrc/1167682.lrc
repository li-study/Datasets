[00:12.14]Title:Misty Morning
[00:16.86]Misty mornin', don't see no sun;
[00:24.39]I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
[00:32.32]There is one mystery - yea-ea-eah - I just can't express:
[00:39.84]To give your more, to receive your less.
[00:47.95]One of my good friend said, in a reggae riddim,
[00:55.41]Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim.
[01:02.98]The power of philosophy - yea-ea-eah - floats through my head
[01:11.09]Light like a feather, heavy as lead;
[01:18.99]Light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah.
[01:31.02]See no sun! Oh.
[01:37.85]Time has come, I want you -
[01:41.57]I want you to straighten out my tomorrow! Uh.
[01:48.29]I want - I want - I want you - (tomorrow).
[01:52.70]Oh, wo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
[01:55.91]I want you to straighten out my (tomorrow)!
[02:04.89]Misty (morning) mornin', don't see no sun;
[02:11.93]I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
[02:20.64]Mysteries I just can't express:
[02:27.48]How can you ever give your more to receive your less?
[02:35.84]Like my good friend said, in a reggae riddim:
[02:42.19]You can't jump - you can't jump in the water, if you can't swim.
[02:48.52]I want you (I want you) - I want you to straighten out my today -
[02:54.39]My tomorrow - my-my-my - my - my
[02:57.61](I want you to straighten out my tomorrow).
[03:02.11]On a misty morning, uh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow).
[03:05.70]Oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh!
[03:08.72](I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
[03:09.23]Straighten out my tomorrow - my tomorrow! Need some straightenin' out!
[03:11.17](I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
[03:17.92]Mist! Mm. (I want) Mist! (you to straighten out my tomorrow)
[03:24.23]Misty! Oh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow) - /fadeout/
