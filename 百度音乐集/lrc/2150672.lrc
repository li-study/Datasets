[00:22.00]You saw me standing by the wall,
[00:27.80]Corner of a main street
[00:31.36]And the lights are flashing on your window sill
[00:39.70]Take a chance
[00:41.31]Like all dreamers can't find another way
[00:48.32]You don't have to dream it all, just live a day
[00:56.91]Don't save a prayer for me now,
[01:01.74]Save it 'til the morning after
[01:04.76]No, don't say a prayer for me now,
[01:10.10]Save it 'til the morning after ...
[01:46.83]Pretty looking road,
[01:48.53]try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
[01:55.40]Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise,
[01:59.80]I'll melt the ice
[02:04.32]And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
[02:08.79]But fear is in your soul
[02:12.41]Some people call it a one night stand
[02:16.22]But we can call it paradise
[02:21.43]Don't save a prayer for me now,
[02:26.22]Save it 'til the morning after
[02:29.61]No, don't say a prayer for me now,
[02:34.76]Save it 'til the morning after ...
[03:10.79]Save A Prayer 'til the morning after ...
