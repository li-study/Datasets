[00:00.84]So you're with her
[00:03.03]and not with me
[00:05.28]I hope she's sweet
[00:07.21]and so pretty

[00:14.91]a little angel beside you
[00:20.04]So you're with her

[00:29.71]I hear your house
[00:33.35]is small and clean
[00:36.46]Oh how lovely with your homecoming queen
[00:40.76]Oh how lovely it must be
[00:46.58]When you see her sweet smile baby
[00:52.17]Don't think of me

[01:08.89]So you're with her
[01:11.92]and not with me
[01:14.13]I know she spreads sweet honey

[02:15.53]Don't think of me
[02:21.28]Does it bother you now all the mess I made
[02:27.96]Does it bother you now the clothes you told me not to wear
[02:33.75]Does it bother you now all the angry games we played
[02:37.95]Does it bother you now when I'm not there
[02:46.06]When you see her sweet smile baby
[02:52.19]Don't think of me
[02:54.77]When she lays in your warm arms
[03:02.55]Don't think of me
[03:06.80]And it's too late and it's too bad
