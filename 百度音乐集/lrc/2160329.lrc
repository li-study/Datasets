[00:05.43]
[00:06.85]Shadows fill an empty heart
[00:10.52]As love is fading,
[00:12.72]From all the things that we are
[00:16.47]But are not saying.
[00:18.65]Can we see beyond the scars
[00:22.19]And make it to the dawn?
[00:27.40]Change the colors of the sky.
[00:31.36]And open up to
[00:33.51]The ways you made me feel alive,
[00:37.20]The ways I loved you.
[00:39.56]For all the things that never died,
[00:43.15]To make it through the night,
[00:45.56]Love will find you.
[00:49.37]What about now
[00:52.26]What about today
[00:55.27]What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
[01:01.13]What if our love never went away
[01:06.96]What if it's lost behind words we could never find
[01:12.96]Baby, before it's too late,
[01:18.86]What about now
[01:21.30]
[01:26.97]The sun is breaking in your eyes
[01:30.55]To start a new day.
[01:32.88]This broken heart can still survive
[01:36.27]With a touch of your grace.
[01:38.74]Shadows fade into the light.
[01:42.47]I am by your side,
[01:44.87]Where love will find you.
[01:48.11]What about now?
[01:51.38]What about today?
[01:54.44]What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
[02:00.44]What if our love, it never went away
[02:06.19]What if it's lost behind words we could never find
[02:12.17]Baby, before it's too late,
[02:17.73]What about now
[02:21.08]Now that we're here,
[02:24.02]Now that we've come this far,
[02:27.75]Just hold on.
[02:32.25]There is nothing to fear,
[02:35.83]For I am right beside you.
[02:42.25]For all my life,
[02:47.84]I am yours.
[02:53.71]What about now
[02:56.41]What about today
[02:59.38]What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
[03:05.50]What if our love never went away
[03:11.23]What if it's lost behind words we could never find
[03:17.40]What about now
[03:20.34]What about today
[03:23.21]What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
[03:29.29]What if our love never went away
[03:35.08]What if it's lost behind words we could never find
[03:41.02]Baby, before it's too late,
[03:46.68]Baby, before it's too late,
[03:52.66]Baby, before it's too late,
[04:01.95]What about now?
