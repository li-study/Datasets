[00:03.03]One Moment In Time
[00:06.83]Whitney Houston
[00:09.92]
[00:14.71]Each day I live
[00:17.59]I want to be a day to give the best of me
[00:26.71]I'm only one,but not alone
[00:32.63]My finest day is yet unknown
[00:38.56]I broke my heart for every gain
[00:45.55]To taste the sweet
[00:47.45]I faced the pain
[00:51.00]I rist and fall,
[00:54.43]yet through it all
[00:57.75]this much remains
[01:00.25]I was one moment in time
[01:07.61]When I'm more than
[01:09.35]I thought I could be
[01:13.93]When all of my dreams
[01:16.77]are a heartbeat away
[01:19.83]And the answers are all up to me
[01:25.00]Give me one moment in time
[01:32.17]When I'm racing with destiny
[01:38.69]Then in that one moment of time
[01:44.46]I will feel, I will feel eternity
[01:53.72]
[01:57.80]I will live to be the very best
[02:03.95]I want it all, no time for less
[02:09.79]I've laid the plans
[02:13.03]Now lay the chance here in my hands
[02:18.56]Give me one moment in time
[02:25.96]When I'm more than
[02:27.66]I thought I could be
[02:32.29]When all of my dreams
[02:35.23]are a heartbeat away
[02:38.15]And the answers are all up to me
[02:43.33]Give me one moment in time
[02:50.51]When I'm racing with destiny
[02:57.16]Then in that one moment of time
[03:02.76]I will feel, I will feel eternity
[03:13.25]You're a winner for a lifetime
[03:19.35]If you seize that one moment in time
[03:25.24]Make it shine
[03:27.97]Give me one moment in time
[03:35.82]When I'm more than
[03:37.99]I thought I could be
[03:43.03]When all of my dreams
[03:46.15]are a heartbeat away
[03:49.57]And the answers are all up to me
[03:55.10]Give me one moment in time
[04:02.80]When I'm racing with destiny
[04:10.20]Then in that one moment of time
[04:16.18]I will be, I will be,
[04:22.15]I will be free
[04:29.60]
[04:30.97]I will be, I will be free
[04:41.03]
