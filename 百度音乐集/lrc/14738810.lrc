[00:13.52]词曲：杨秉音  编曲：曲世聪
[00:19.47]
[02:15.59][00:24.62]Will you remember the summer
[02:20.12][00:28.07]You left then came back
[02:25.64][00:34.60]Disappearing through and endless
[02:30.53][00:38.68]diamond shimmering sky
[02:34.30][00:42.22]Like a shooting star splitted the night
[02:42.61][00:51.87]
[02:47.64][00:54.76]I'm flying to be free passed the
[02:52.79][01:01.55]clouds till the rainbow's end
[02:58.28][01:05.57]Searching for you and trace above
[03:02.17][01:10.00]the halo of the street lamps
[03:06.65][01:13.71]
[03:07.59][01:15.63]Tears in my eyes
[03:11.27][01:19.54]Do not cry
[03:38.01][03:16.64][01:26.41]You lay a whisper in my dream
[03:48.29][03:27.63][01:37.22]I see an angel when you smile
[03:58.61][01:47.43]
