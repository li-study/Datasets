[00:13.81]Lay on the floor   Breathe it in deep
[00:19.78]Don't speak, don't say a word
[00:23.10]Just savoring   You're all that I have
[00:28.83]And all to hold on to
[00:32.01]You can't lead me on
[00:35.40]Come on, come on  Can't you feel it
[00:39.24]And start chasing dreams
[00:41.53]And don't let it go (?)
[00:47.28]And take me away
[00:49.19]Let's get out of this town
[00:52.67]Baby, run  We're unstoppable now
[00:58.25]On top of the world
[01:00.31]Sing it out loud
[01:02.10]And mean it and keep believing
[01:07.42]We've got the rest of our lives
[01:11.56]Let it ride
[01:16.56]Running away   Don't tell anyone
[01:23.06]We'll be the talk of the town
[01:26.36]We'll be the envy of everyone
[01:28.83]Dances to mixtapes and car tops
[01:33.80]So don't, don't, don't let this go
[01:39.10]And take me away
[01:41.32]Let's get out of this town
[01:44.17]Baby, run  We're unstoppable now
[01:49.88]On top of the world
[01:51.85]Sing it out loud
[01:53.91]And mean it and keep believing
[01:58.22]We've got the rest of our lives
[02:02.87]So let it ride
[02:11.89]The time of our lives  Let it ride
[02:30.49]
[02:54.74][02:30.33]take me away
[02:57.38][02:32.90]Let's get out of this town
[03:00.09][02:35.97]Baby, run  We're unstoppable now
[03:06.07][02:41.71]On top of the world   Sing it out loud
[03:09.47][02:45.28]And mean it and keep believing
[03:14.49][02:50.03]We've got the rest of our lives
