[00:33.92]That stupid bitch but I think
[00:35.65]Someone here is having no fun
[00:39.52]And now that you have found me
[00:40.94]I feel you’re gazing
[00:43.28]And every move I make is
[00:45.80]Driving you insane
[00:47.72]Baby
[00:50.35]You can go and tell your friends
[00:53.23]About my past and how you hate me
