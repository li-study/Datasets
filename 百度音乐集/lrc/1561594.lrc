[00:04.49]演唱：张悬
[00:06.04]
[00:33.70]为了想要得到自由
[00:37.32]我在我身上插上翅膀
[00:41.77]飞过高山　飞过河流
[00:45.73]才发现我的自由全都只是想像
[00:50.22]其实我都一直在逃避
[00:53.90]逃避全世界最难以面对的自己
[00:58.50]I just want to get away from me
[01:07.18]I just want to get away from me
[01:13.42]如此而已
[01:16.46]
[01:53.08]为了无法忍受寂寞
[01:56.93]我从你的手中要走爱情
[02:01.19]过了两年觉得累了
[02:05.14]我又在我身上插上翅膀
[02:09.41]下一次我要走到哪裡？
[02:13.33]逃避全世界最难以面对的自己
[02:17.86]I just want to get away from me
[02:26.26]I just want to get away from me
[02:32.47]如此而已
[02:36.08]
[02:38.90]Aiiii
[02:47.35]Aiiii　Aiiiii
[03:03.98]Hide　Hide away from me
[03:08.88]
[03:45.27]I just want to get away from me
[03:53.43]I just want to get away from me
[04:00.13]如此而已
[04:03.94]
[04:06.64]Aiiii
[04:14.78]Aiiii　Aiiiii
[04:31.69]Hide　Hide away from me
[04:39.89]Hide　我躲不掉我自己
[04:45.72]
