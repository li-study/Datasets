[00:48.87]
[00:59.03]Never hunger
[01:01.83]Never prosper
[01:02.66]I have fallen prey to failure
[01:10.38]Struggle within
[01:11.49]Triggered again
[01:12.77]Now the candle burns at both ends
[01:15.88]
[01:17.32]Twisting under schizophrenia
[01:21.94]Falling deep into dementia
[01:25.91]
[06:42.84][02:48.04][01:40.45]Old habits reappear
[06:46.53][02:54.25][01:42.86]Fighting the fear of fear
[06:50.27][02:57.95][01:47.59]Growing conspiracy
[03:00.86][01:51.30]Everyone's after me
[06:58.64][06:54.12][03:03.17][01:53.02]Frayed ends of sanity
[07:01.08][06:56.78][03:05.56][01:55.49]Hear them calling
[07:04.00][03:08.32][01:57.85]Hear them calling me
[02:02.08]
[02:10.42]Birth of terror
[02:11.64]Death of much more
[02:13.00]I'm the slave of fear, my captor
[02:17.65]Never warnings
[02:21.69]Spreading its wings
[02:23.09]As I wait for the horror she brings
[02:26.51]
[02:27.39]Loss of interest, question, wonder
[02:32.80]Waves of fear they pull me under
[02:39.82]
[03:12.91](solo)
[06:01.40]Into ruin
[06:03.75]I am sinking
[06:05.03]Hostage of this nameless feeling
[06:10.12]Hell is set free
[06:13.77]Flooded I'll be
[06:15.39]Feel the undertow inside me
[06:19.10]
[06:19.58]Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
[06:25.11]Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
[06:30.13]
[06:53.14]Myself is after me
[07:11.58]
