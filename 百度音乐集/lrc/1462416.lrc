[00:17.30]I had a dream, a crazy vision
[00:24.22]it may sound strange this intuition
[00:31.19]But it was true beyond description
[00:38.73]And somehow I knew it was real when I saw
[00:47.56]CHORUS: One sky above there is just one source of love
[00:59.96]If I've got one chance, one choice
[01:05.86]I'll sing it from the heart
[01:08.67]One song, one voice
[01:13.52]I've seen the fires of deep division
[01:20.63]The hearts of stone, the cold ambition
[01:27.79]But I have found my sacred mission
[01:35.11]To live in this world and still believe that there is
[01:43.84]CHORUS: One sky above there is just one source of love
[01:56.31]If I've got one chance, one choice
[02:02.36]I'll sing it from the heart
[02:05.07]One song, one voice
[02:11.30]A song, a song that heals
[02:17.38]A melody of reason and freedom
[02:25.10]With words that will speak for the weak
[02:30.48]the hopeful and the strong
[02:34.98]Sing it for everyone
[02:38.60]Cuz there is
[02:40.30]CHORUS: One sky above there is just one source of love
[02:52.62]If I've got one chance, one choice
[02:58.81]I'll sing it from the heart
[03:01.42]One song, one voice
[03:08.63]One sky above there is just one source of love  (Yes there is one sky above)
[03:16.14]One source of love
[03:21.39]If I got one chance, one choice
[03:27.39]Sing it from the heart
[03:29.70]One song, one voice
[03:38.55]Sing it with one song
[03:45.98]One voice
