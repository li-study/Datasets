[00:13.11]I know that it's late
[00:16.12]And maybe I shouldn't be so into you
[00:24.30]It's just that tonight
[00:28.43]I am so taken, I've fallen for you
[00:35.00]When I look in your eyes I can see
[00:41.48]A million possibilities
[00:46.90]And I know you'll be leaving me soon
[00:52.75]But tonight
[04:10.05][03:46.65][03:22.58][02:59.32][02:11.41][01:00.43]Come a little bit closer
[04:13.53][03:50.33][03:26.18][03:02.78][02:15.02][01:04.19]Let me hold you baby

[04:19.55][03:56.26][03:32.17][03:08.79][02:21.77][01:10.35]And we can try
[04:21.90][03:58.39][03:34.23][03:10.93][02:24.11][01:12.84]To forget tomorrow
[04:25.09][04:01.95][03:37.87][03:14.43][02:27.71][01:15.96]And make it last forever tonight
[01:24.54]So if you must go
[01:28.24]Know that I'll be missing you, wishing you closer
[01:35.29]So let's make the most of these
[01:39.67]Moments together, we'll never forget
[01:46.60]And it's breaking my heart 'cause I know
[01:52.19]That tomorrow you'll be miles away
[01:57.99]And I catch myself wanting so much more
[02:03.85]Tonight
[02:32.93]So if youâ€™re leaving me now
[02:36.77]Baby I don't know how
[02:39.78]I will ever get over you
[02:45.50]Because you opened my eyes
[02:48.70]To this love that's inside
[02:51.55]Oh baby, baby,don't ever, ever leave me
