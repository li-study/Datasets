[00:57.39]If you see me with a man
[00:59.53]Understand that you can't question me
[01:02.86]The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault
[01:06.16]It can't help your jealousy
[01:07.99]If you can handle the fact that
[01:10.35]What we have has got to be commitment free
[01:13.56]Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'
[01:17.01]Underneath the sheets

[01:51.41]It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
[01:53.85]Cause this is a physical lovin'
[01:55.60]Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
