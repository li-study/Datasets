[00:44.17]In my hands
[00:46.81]A legacy of memories
[00:52.50]I can hear you say my name
[01:00.27]I can almost see your smile
[01:09.02]Feel the warmth of your embrace
[01:17.29]But there is nothing but silence now
[01:25.45]Around the one I loved
[01:33.94]Is this our farewell?
[01:40.88]
[01:42.01]Sweet darling you worry too much, my child
[01:50.94]See the sadness in your eyes
[01:58.85]You are not alone in life
[02:05.19]Although you might think that you are
[02:12.06]
[02:15.18]Never thought
[02:20.38]This day would come so soon
[02:23.96]We had no time to say goodbye
[02:31.73]How can the world just carry on?
[02:40.34]I feel so lost when you are not at my sight
[02:48.66]But there's nothing but silence now
[02:56.86]Around the one I loved
[03:05.42]Is this our farewell?
[03:10.55]
[03:13.49]Sweet darling you worry too much, my child
[03:22.37]See the sadness in your eyes
[03:30.31]You are not alone in life
[03:36.74]Although you might think that you are
[03:44.26][04:18.31]
[04:20.04]So sorry your world is tumbling down
[04:28.87]I will watch you through these nights
[04:36.59]Rest your head and go to sleep
[04:43.06]Because my child, this is not our farewell.
[04:57.74]This is not our farewell.
