[00:12.49]
[00:17.21]I read your book
[00:23.37]And I find it strange
[00:29.70]That I know that girl and I know her world
[00:35.96]A little too well
[00:42.17]And I didn't know
[00:48.39]By giving my hand
[00:54.51]That I would be written down, sliced around,
[00:59.05]Passed down
[01:00.61]Among strangers hands
[01:06.83]Three days in Rome
[01:13.09]Where do we go
[01:18.83]I'll always remember
[01:24.92]Three days in Rome
[01:30.30]
[01:43.08]Never again
[01:49.27]Would I  see your face
[01:55.25]You carry a pen and a paper
[01:59.75]and no time and words you waste
[02:07.37]oh,You're a voyeur
[02:13.39]The worst kind of thief
[02:19.79]To take what happened to us
[02:22.86]To write down everything that went on
[02:26.75]Between you and me
[02:31.22]Oh,Three days in Rome
[02:40.40]And I stand alone
[02:43.44]I'll always remember
[02:49.07]Three days in Rome
[03:16.43]
[03:18.69]And what do I  get
[03:24.61]Do I get prevanch
[03:30.50]Why you let out
[03:34.43]I done out
[03:42.49]Sometimes will goes
[03:48.23]Sometimes will comes
[03:54.11]To learn by mistake,learn love
[04:00.05]Can't be undone
[04:05.46]Oh,three days in Rome
[04:12.37]I lay my heart down
[04:13.14]I lay my soul down alone
[04:17.64]I always remebmber
[04:23.61]Three days in Rome.
