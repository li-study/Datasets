[00:22.52]The president of the United States of America,
[00:25.98]Is Dead!
[00:30.24]
[00:30.32]I don\'t believe in the politics,
[00:33.25]Of chosen fools and hypocrites,
[00:35.61]Who walk a line that stretched so fine,
[00:38.12]Is death or glory had in mind?

[01:01.53]send in the clowns,
[01:02.94]the carnival of sins is now going to begin,
[01:06.37]
[01:15.24]It may be I\'m a pessimist,
[01:17.47]but I say we need an exorcist,
[01:19.74]the root of all evil standing tall,
[01:22.34]Under god and above us all,
[01:24.98]
[01:25.29]And here we go,
[01:25.81]I\'m getting desperation,
[01:26.97]all we know,
[01:27.95]Is confusion and frustration,
[01:29.53]Ditch your clothes,
[01:30.70]no vision of salvation
[01:32.18]
[01:32.64]It\'s too late there\'s no time, (it\'s too late there\'s no time)
[01:37.27]All for none, never was two, three, four
[01:39.85]

[02:33.38]yes to heaven he fled,
[02:34.52]was it something he said,
[02:35.65]because of who\'s in his bed,
[02:36.91]by who will we be led?
[02:38.36]by whose hand will we be fed?
