[00:22.27]Oh oh oh...
[00:25.42]
[00:32.79]Maybe you\'ve been pouring everything into this
[00:39.40]From a state of bliss it turns to agony,
[00:46.66]You can\'t predict this
[00:50.08]When it comes to it,
[00:52.06]You can\'t hide from it,
[00:54.00]but don\'t you surrender anything...
[00:58.75]
[01:00.45]Don\'t you know that, that patience is a virtue (yes it is)
[01:08.49]And life is a waiting game don\'t you know that?
[01:16.58]Peace must be nurtured
[01:21.73]and all the money in the world can\'t buy you nothing
[01:27.89](let me tell you that...)
[01:29.45]
[01:31.31]All these things happen, all these things happen for a reason
[01:41.76]So don\'t you go and throw it all away
[01:48.68]You\'ll get yours when the seasons change
[01:53.71]
[01:56.06]Oh oh oh...
[02:02.60]
[02:15.69]Hurts me to see you feel this way but it won\'t be always
[02:21.92]Don\'t you know everything got to change, oh...
[02:30.25]Feel like all your hope is gone,
[02:32.84]you can\'t carry on
[02:34.86]but there\'s nothing wrong
[02:38.01]
[02:38.95]You don\'t have to pretend with me
[02:42.16]Don\'t you know that, that patience is a virtue (yes it is)
[02:50.05]And life is a waiting game, don\'t you know that?
[02:59.17]peace must be nurtured
[03:05.36]and all the money in the world can\'t buy you nothing
[03:10.80](let me tell you that...)
[03:12.84]
[03:15.52]All these things happen
[03:17.60]All these happen for a reason
[03:20.48]So don\'t you go and throw it all away
[03:30.03]you\'ll get yours when the seasons change
