[00:02.40]In Too Deep
[00:04.44]Genesis
[00:07.11]Invisible Touch
[00:10.40]All that time I was searching,
[00:13.07]nowhere to run to,
[00:16.46]it started me thinking,
[00:19.90]Wondering what I could make of my life,
[00:26.17]who'd be waiting,
[00:28.72]Asking all kinds of questions,
[00:32.07]to myself,
[00:34.42]but never finding the answers,
[00:38.39]Crying at the top of my voice,
[00:44.24]no one listening,
[00:48.20]All this time,
[00:50.62]I still remember everything you said
[00:57.99]There's so much you promised,
[01:00.99]how could I ever forget.
[01:04.49]Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
[01:09.87]You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
[01:14.80]Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
[01:19.41]You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.
[01:25.72]So listen, listen to me,
[01:31.99]You must believe me,
[01:35.62]I can feel your eyes go thru me,
[01:39.84]But I don't know why.
[01:43.28]I know you're going,
[01:45.97]but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
[01:52.46]It's like we never knew each other at all,
[01:58.89]it may be my fault,
[02:01.12]I gave you too many reasons,
[02:04.43]beeing alone,
[02:07.72]when I didn't want to
[02:11.30]I thought you'd always be there,
[02:16.82]I almost believed you,
[02:20.87]All this time,
[02:23.15]I still remember everything you said,
[02:30.03]there's so much you promised,
[02:33.44]how could I ever forget.
[02:37.40]Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
[02:42.99]You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
[02:47.41]Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
[02:51.94]You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.
[02:57.62]So listen, listen to me,
[03:03.05]I can feel your eyes go thru me
[03:33.95]It seems I've spent too long
[03:37.46]Only thinking about myself
[03:45.14]Now I want to spend my life
[03:48.07]Just caring about somebody else.
[03:51.36]Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
[03:57.25]You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
[04:01.63]Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
[04:06.28]You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.
