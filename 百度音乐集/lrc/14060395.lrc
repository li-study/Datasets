You're only seventeen
Today or tomorrow
You expect a
Surprise
Full of erotic
The first that you can see
But you don't know
She's full of lies
When she passes you by
You believe that she's alright
Your eyes aren't
Seeing clear
When she can sign
She takes possession
You don't know
Her combat mission
Oh it's a dark fate - for you
Dark fate for you
Dark fate for you
Oh dark fate for you
Your fate is sealed
At that moment
When you meet her
Slow but sure
You feel so sad
Warlock
You can't go back
You're only seventeen
Today or tomorrow
You expect a
Surprise
Full of erotic
The first that you can see
But you don't know
She's full of lies
When she passes you by
You believe that she's alright
Your eyes aren't
Seeing clear
When she can sign
She takes possession
You don't know
Her combat mission
Oh it's a dark fate - for you
Dark fate for you
Dark fate for you
Oh dark fate for you
Your fate is sealed
At that moment
When you meet her
And slow but sure
You feel so sad
You can't go back
Slow but sure
You feel so sad
You can't go back
You're only seventeen
Today or tomorrow
You expect a
Surprise
