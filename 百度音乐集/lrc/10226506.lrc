[00:10.50]He was born in the summer of his 27th year
[00:16.50]Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
[00:23.50]He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
[00:28.50]You might say he found a key for every door
[00:33.50]
[00:34.50]When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
[00:40.50]On the road and hangin' by a song
[00:46.50]But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
[00:52.50]It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long
[00:56.50]
[00:58.50]But the Colorado rocky mountain high
[01:04.50]I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[01:10.50]The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
[01:19.50]Rocky mountain high
[01:25.50]Rocky mountain high
[01:32.50]He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
[01:37.50]He saw everything as far as you can see
[01:43.50]And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
[01:49.50]And he lost a friend but kept his memory
[01:53.50]
[01:55.50]Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
[02:01.50]Seeking grace in every step he takes
[02:06.50]His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
[02:12.50]The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
[02:16.50]
[02:18.50]And the Colorado rocky mountain high
[02:24.50]I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[02:30.50]You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
[02:39.50]Rocky mountain high
[02:45.50]Rocky mountain high
[02:52.50]Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
[02:57.50]Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
[03:03.50]Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
[03:09.50]More people, more scars upon the land
[03:13.50]
[03:15.50]And the Colorado rocky mountain high
[03:21.50]I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[03:27.50]I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
[03:36.50]Rocky mountain high
[03:41.50]It's Colorado rocky mountain high
[03:46.50]I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[03:52.50]Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
[04:01.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:07.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:13.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:19.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:24.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:30.50]Rocky mountain high
[04:36.50]
