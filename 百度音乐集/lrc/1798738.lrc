[00:01.50]One Step At A Time
[00:03.69]Jordin Sparks 
[00:05.39]
[00:12.57]Hurry up and wait
[00:17.16]So close, but so far away
[00:21.85]Everything that you've always dreamed of
[00:26.24]Close enough that you can taste
[00:28.93]But you just can't touch
[00:31.33]You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
[00:33.72]You wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
[00:36.12]You know you can if you get the chance
[00:38.51]In your face as the door keeps slamming
[00:40.81]Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
[00:43.01]And you're getting all kind impatient, waiting
[00:47.39]We live and we learn to take...
[00:49.69]One step at a time
[00:52.08]There's no need to rush
[00:54.08]It's like learning to fly
[00:56.67]Or falling in love
[00:59.66]It's gonna happen and it's
[01:01.86]Supposed to happen that we
[01:03.95]Find the reasons why
[01:07.24]One step at a time
[01:09.51]
[01:18.42]You believe and you doubt
[01:23.01]You're confused and got it all figured out
[01:27.90]Everything that you've always wished for
[01:32.09]Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
[01:35.08]If they only knew
[01:37.08]You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
[01:39.87]You wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
[01:41.96]You know you can if you get the chance
[01:44.16]In your face as the door keeps slamming
[01:47.55]Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
[01:48.95]And you're getting all kind impatient, waiting
[01:51.34]We live and we learn to take...

[02:10.00]Find the reasons why
[02:13.08]One step at a time
[02:15.72]
[02:16.58]When you can't wait any longer
[02:20.77]But there's no end in sight (When you need to find the strength)
[02:25.46]It's your faith that makes you stronger
[02:29.15]The only we get there is one step at a time
[02:37.37]
[02:42.23]Take one step at a time
[02:45.01]There's no need to rush
