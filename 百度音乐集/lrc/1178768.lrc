[00:00.25]
[00:04.83]I woke up 'round half-past ten
[00:06.92]Can't believe I'm late again
[00:10.30]Put down 'bout a quart of caffine
[00:12.56]To start my pulse and then
[00:15.18]I grapped my jeans off the floor
[00:17.01]and I hit the door
[00:18.26]Just the same old same
[00:21.32]It goes to show
[00:22.64]You never know
[00:24.00]When everything's about to change
[00:27.35]Just another day
[00:28.84]Started out like any other
[00:31.98]Just another girl
[00:35.35]who took my breath away
[00:37.37]Then she turned around
[00:41.41]She took me down and
[00:42.81]Just another day that I...
[00:47.06]Had the best day of my life
[00:50.31]
[00:51.10]Can't say exactly what it was
[00:53.07]She's not the usual type
[00:56.23]She wore a cowboy hat
[00:57.58]With her red Pranda boots
[00:59.06]And a Gwen Stefani smile
[01:01.66]Then she pulled out a pen
[01:02.92]and suprised me when
[01:04.10]She wrote her number on my hand
[01:06.81]Then she was gone
[01:08.10]But from now on
[01:09.44]I'm gonna be a different man
[01:12.66]Just another day
[01:15.20]started out like any other
[01:18.13]Just another girl
[01:20.27]who tooked my breath away
[01:23.18]Then she turned around
[01:26.49]She took me down
[01:29.05]Just another day that I......
[01:32.59]Had the best day of my life
[01:36.08]I guess it goes to show
[01:38.62]You never really know
[01:40.11]When everything's 'bout to change
[01:45.05]Just another day
[01:47.11]Started out like any other
[01:50.50]Just another girl
[01:52.50]who tooked my breath away
[01:55.19]Then she turned around
[01:59.10]She took me down
[02:01.19]Just another day that I......
[02:04.64]Had the best day of my life
[02:06.87]Just another day
[02:08.88]Started out like any other
[02:12.06]Just another girl
[02:14.37]who tooked my breath away
[02:17.40]Then she turned around
[02:20.81]She took me down
[02:23.06]Just another day that I......
[02:26.48]Had the best day of my life
[02:31.02]
[02:36.97]Had the best day of my life
[02:42.36]Had the best day of my life
