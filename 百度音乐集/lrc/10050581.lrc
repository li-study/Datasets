[00:11.42]As I walk this land of broken dreams
[00:16.34]I have visions of many things
[00:21.07]Love's happiness is just an illusion
[00:25.76]Filled with sadness and confusion.
[00:30.64]What becomes of the brokenhearted
[00:35.39]Who had love that's now departed?
[00:39.97]I know I've got to find
[00:42.19]Some kind of peace of mind, maybe
[00:49.62]The fruits of love grow all around
[00:54.25]But for me they come tumbling down.
[00:59.13]Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
[01:03.70]I can't stand this pain much longer
[01:08.50]I walk in shadows searching for light
[01:13.09]Cold and alone, no comfort in sight,
[01:17.88]Hoping and praying for someone to care
[01:22.52]Always moving and going nowhere
[01:27.35]What becomes of the brokenhearted
[01:32.08]Who had love that's now departed?
[01:36.79]I know I've got to find
[01:38.79]Some kind of peace of mind, baby
[01:46.16]I'm searching though I don't succeed,
[01:50.89]But someone look, there's a growing need.
[01:55.52]Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning,
[02:00.12]All that's left is an unhappy ending.
[02:05.07]Now what's become of the brokenhearted
[02:09.79]Who had love that's now departed?
[02:14.40]I know I've got to find
[02:16.53]Some kind of peace of mind
[02:19.27]I'll be searching everywhere
[02:21.25]Just to find someone to care.
[02:24.13]I'll be looking every day
[02:25.99]I know I'm gonna find a way
[02:28.46]Nothing's gonna stop me now
[02:30.73]I will find a way somehow
[02:33.99](What's become, what's become,
[02:38.47]What's become of the brokenhearted
[02:42.91]What's become, what's become,
[02:48.64]What's become of the brokenhearted)
[02:51.74]I knooow, ohh yeah....
