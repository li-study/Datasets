[00:01]Adia I do believe I've failed you
[00:07]Adia I know I've let you down
[00:13]Don't you know I tried so hard
[00:16]To love you in my way?
[00:21]It's easy....let it go...
[00:31]Adia, I'm empty since you left me
[00:37]I try to find a way to carry on
[00:43]I search myself and everyone
[00:46]To see where we went wrong
[00:49]There's no one left to finger
[00:52]There's no one left to blame
[00:55]There's no one left to talk to, honey
[00:58]And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
[01:03]'Cause we are born innocent
[01:10]Believe me Adia
[01:14]We are still innocent
[01:20]It's easy, we all falter
[01:26]Does it matter?
[01:30]Adia, I tought that we could make it
[01:37]I know I can't change the way you feel
[01:43]I leave you with your misery
[01:46]A friend who won't betray
[01:49]I'll pull you from your tower
[01:52]I'll take away your pain
[01:55]Show you all the beauty you possess
[01:59]If only you'd let yourself believe
[02:03]That we are born innocent
[02:10]Believe me Adia
[02:14]We are still innocent
[02:20]It's easy, we all falter
[02:26]Does it matter?
[02:47]'Cause we are born innocent
[02:54]Believe me Adia
[02:58]We are still innocent
[03:05]It's easy, we all falter
[03:11]Does it matter?
[03:13]Believe me Adia
[03:17]We are still innocent
[03:25]'Cause we are born innocent
[03:32]Believe me Adia
[03:36]We are still innocent
[03:42]It's easy, we all falter
[03:48]Does it matter?
