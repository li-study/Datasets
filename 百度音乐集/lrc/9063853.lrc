[00:12.68]Loneliness is always looking for a friend
[00:17.50]It found me once and it has been around since then
[00:22.68]Loneliness is never waiting by the door
[00:27.72]It sweeps right through and it will never be ignored
[00:32.83]Why, why was I chosen?
[00:37.91]Why am I left without?
[02:36.85][02:16.43][00:42.91]The Love of my life, the love that I need
[02:41.75][02:21.50][00:47.88]The love that they say is in life for free
[02:46.82][02:26.54][00:52.92]The love of dreams, the love that I want
[02:51.99][02:31.90][00:58.21]Loneliness knows me by name
[01:03.36]Loneliness knows everything I keep inside
[01:08.19]My endless thoughts in the silence of the night
[01:13.33]Loneliness is the one who made me see
[01:18.19]Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me
[01:23.88]Why, why was I chosen?
[01:28.89]Why am I left without?
[01:33.52]The Love of my life, the love that I need
[01:38.48]The love that they say is in life for free
[01:43.52]The love of dreams, the love that I want
[01:48.79]Loneliness knows me by name
[01:54.32]Less is more and that would be the vacant space
[01:58.77]The cried out tears and a never ending maze
[02:03.65]I have found what only loneliness provides
[02:08.88]A strength within knowing I will find
