[ti:Have You Ever Seen The Rain]
[ar:Creedence Clearwater Revival]

[00:14.00]Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm.
[00:21.00]I know, and it's been comin' for some time.
[00:30.00]When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day.
[00:38.00]I know, shinin' down like water.
[00:47.00]I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
[00:56.00]I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
[01:04.00]comin' down on a sunny day?
[01:12.00]Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard.
[01:19.00]I know, been that way for all my time.
[01:28.00]'Til forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow,
[01:35.00]I know, and it can't stop, I wonder.
[02:10.00][01:44.00]I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
[02:19.00][01:53.00]I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
[02:27.00][02:02.00]comin' down on a sunny day?
