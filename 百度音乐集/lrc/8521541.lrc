[00:00.82]Cold Brains-Beck
[00:11.26]
[00:26.20]Cold brains,
[00:27.74]Unmoved,
[00:29.32]Untouched,
[00:30.89]Unglued
[00:32.51]Alone at last
[00:38.66]No thoughts,
[00:40.24]No mind
[00:41.76]To rot
[00:43.39]Behind
[00:45.15]A trail of disasters
[00:51.24]A final curse
[00:54.34]Abandoned hearse
[00:57.34]We ride disowned
[01:00.51]Corroded to the bone
[01:09.60]The fields of green
[01:12.70]Are bent, obscene
[01:16.07]I lay upon the gravel
[01:22.06]A worm of hope
[01:25.24]A hangman's rope
[01:28.15]Pulls me one way or the other
[01:34.47]A final curse
[01:37.38]Abandoned hearse
[01:40.55]We write this song
[01:43.62]Corroded to the bone
[02:17.46]A bird of song
[02:20.35]Is heard no longer
[02:23.76]In the evacuated heavens
[02:29.26]The drain is drawn
[02:32.36]And drained and gone
[02:35.50]And on and on, it doesn't matter
[02:41.54]A final curse
[02:44.38]Abandoned hearse
[02:47.40]We ride this old
[02:50.50]Corroded to the bone
