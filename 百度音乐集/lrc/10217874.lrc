[00:02.50]Michael Jackson
[00:05.50]
[00:11.26]Looking out across the night time
[00:16.56]The city winks a sleepless eye
[00:21.32]Hear her voice shake my window
[00:26.91]Sweet seducing sighs
[00:30.45]
[00:31.60]Get me out into the night time
[00:37.04]Four walls won't hold me tonight
[00:41.95]If this town is just an apple
[00:47.24]Then let me take a bite
[00:50.67]
[00:51.31]If they say, why, why?
[00:54.85]Tell 'em that is human nature
[00:57.39]Why, why does he do me that way?
[01:01.54]If they say, why, why?
[01:05.01]Tell 'em that is human nature
[01:07.67]Why, why does he do me that way?
[01:11.67]
[01:12.83]Reaching out to touch a stranger
[01:18.33]Electric eyes are everywhere
[01:23.13]See that girl, she knows I'm watching
[01:28.53]She likes the way I stare
[01:32.00]
[01:32.63]If they say, why, why?
[01:35.90]Tell 'em that is human nature
[01:38.57]Why, why does he do me that way?
[01:42.94]If they say, why, why?
[01:46.39]Tell 'em that is human nature
[01:48.90]Why, why does he do me that way?
[01:53.62]I like livin' this way, I like lovin' this way
[01:58.20]
[02:14.38]Looking out across the morning
[02:20.13]The city's heart begins to beat
[02:25.08]Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
[02:30.51]I'm dreaming of the street
[02:33.94]
[02:34.49]If they say, why, why?
[02:38.11]Tell 'em that is human nature
[02:40.51]Why, why does he do me that way?
[02:44.69]If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
[02:51.09]Why, why does he do me that way?
[02:54.53]
[02:55.10]If they say, why, why? Cha cha cha
[03:01.19]Why, why does he do me that way?
[03:05.38]If they say why, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
[03:11.66]Why, why does he do me that way?
[03:15.78]If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
[03:22.02]Why, why does he do me that way?
[03:26.48]If they say, why, why? Da da da
[03:32.18]Why, why does he do me that way?
[03:37.06]I like livin' this way
[03:38.77]
