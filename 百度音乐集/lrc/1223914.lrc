[00:00.21]Hooo oa
[00:04.09]Uhhhh
[00:07.27]A yeah
[00:12.34]
[00:15.58]I had it all
[00:18.45]But I let it slip away
[00:23.09]Couldn't see I treated you wrong
[00:29.76]Now I wander around
[00:33.40]Feeling down and cold
[00:38.32]Trying to believe that you're gone
[00:43.69]
[00:45.34]Love takes time
[00:48.75]To heal then you're hurting so much
[00:51.76]Couldn't see that I was blind
[00:55.85]To let you go
[00:58.71]I can't escape the pain
[01:01.99]Inside
[01:03.77]'Cause love takes time
[01:08.84]I don't wanna be here
[01:12.56]I don't wanna be here
[01:14.96]Alone
[01:18.40]Uhhoo
[01:22.41]
[01:24.04]Losing my mind
[01:26.39]From this hollow in my heart
[01:31.34]Suddenly I'm so incomplete
[01:38.48]Lord I'm needing you now
[01:41.54]Tell me how to stop the rain
[01:46.19]Tears are falling down endlessly
[01:51.35]Ooh
[01:52.30]
[01:53.58]Love takes time
[01:57.38]To heal then you're hurting so much
[02:00.32]Couldn't see that I was blind
[02:04.58]To let you go
[02:07.31]I can't escape the pain
[02:10.47]Inside
[02:12.23]'Cause love takes time
[02:16.25]I don't wanna be here
[02:19.55]I don't wanna be here
[02:23.54]Alone
[02:26.88]Uhhoo
[02:27.70]
[02:29.26]You might say that it's over
[02:36.68]You might say that you don't care
[02:43.10]You might say you don't miss me
[02:48.05]You don't need me
[02:50.01]But I know that you do and I feel that you do
[02:54.40]Inside
[02:57.88]Ooh
[02:57.54]
[02:59.09]Love takes time
[03:01.90]To heal then you're hurting so much
[03:05.38]Couldn't see that I was blind
[03:09.45]To let you go
[03:12.53]I can't escape the pain
[03:15.79]Inside
[03:17.14]'Cause love takes time
[03:22.28]I don't wanna be here
[03:26.32]I don't wanna be here
[03:28.95]Alone
