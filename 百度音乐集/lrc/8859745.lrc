[00:47.68]I can feel the sands of time
[00:50.02]Passing through the hourglass
[00:52.30]And it shimmers in my eyes
[00:56.96]As I linger in the wake
[00:59.30]As eternity escapes
[01:01.80]I begin to realize
[01:05.31]
[01:06.09]We'll walk a thousand miles just to see for ourselves
[01:10.80]Look behind our eyes
[01:13.76]Find our hell
[01:15.84]And in the light of the sun we go
[01:18.17]Through rain and raging snow
[01:20.51]To find the things we do not know
[01:23.97]
[01:24.29]I will go
[01:26.51]Never laying low
[01:28.90]Just tell me how to breathe
[01:31.13]And I will make it so
[01:34.77]You must know
[01:37.08]That this is not for show
[01:39.40]And if you are not wise (it will)
[01:41.97]Be your demise
[01:46.32]
[02:13.89]Once I walked along a field
[02:16.20]Another nightmare in my mind
[02:18.60]And beheld the fearful symmetry
[02:23.20]Everything was beautiful
[02:25.49]Even things that were dead
[02:28.01]And I surged with violent imagery
[02:31.28]
[02:32.31]I walked a thousand miles just to see for myself
[02:37.01]Looked behind my eyes
[02:39.98]And found my hell
[02:41.47]
[02:41.92]And in the light of the sun we go
[02:44.32]Through rain and raging snow
[02:46.77]To find the things we do not know
[02:49.80]
[02:50.57]I will go
[02:52.74]Never laying low
[02:55.03]Just tell me how to breathe
[02:57.13]And I will make it so
[03:00.92]You must know
[03:03.21]That this is not for show
[03:05.56]And if you are not wise (it will)
[03:07.76]Be your demise
[03:11.37]
[03:49.28]We come to honor; to stand or die
[03:53.73]To pass the hours of our lives
[03:58.44]We burn the silence and all the lies
[04:02.99]To fuel the fire inside our eyes
[04:07.74]We all go!
[04:09.31]
[04:18.76]And in the light of the sun we go
[04:20.98]Through rain and raging snow
[04:23.57]To find the things we do not know
[04:26.85]
[04:27.27]I will go
[04:29.54]Never laying low
[04:31.88]Just tell me how to breathe
[04:34.06]And I will make it so
[04:37.67]You must know
[04:40.00]That this is not for show
[04:42.28]And if you are not wise (it will)
[04:44.44]Be your demise
[04:48.23]
[04:48.59]Come to honor
[04:50.53]Stand or die
[04:52.80]Fuel that fire in your eyes
