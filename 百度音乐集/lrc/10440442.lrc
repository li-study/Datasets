[00:06]Carrie
[00:12]
[00:25]When lights go down,
[00:29]I see no reason
[00:32]For you to cry.
[00:35]We've been through this before
[00:39]In every time,
[00:43]in every season,
[00:46]God knows I've tried
[00:50]So please don't ask for more.
[03:22][02:15][00:55]Can't you see it in my eyes
[03:26][02:19][01:00]This might be our last goodbye
[03:33][02:26][01:07]
[03:34][02:27][01:08]Carrie ..
[03:38][02:31][01:11]Carrie ..
[03:43][02:36][01:16]things they change my friend
[03:48][02:41][01:22]Carrie ..
[03:52][02:45][01:26]Carrie ..
[03:56][01:30]maybe we'll meet again somewhere again
[01:45]I read your mind,
[01:48]with no intentions
[01:51]Of being unkind,
[01:55]I wish I could explain
[01:59]It all takes time,
[02:02]a whole lot of patience
[02:06]If it's a crime,
[02:09]how come I feel no pain.
[02:49]maybe we'll meet again
[02:57]
[04:14]When lights go down
