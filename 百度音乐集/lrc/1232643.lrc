[00:00.71]It's not the pale moon that excites me
[00:12.90]That thrills and delights me
[00:22.48]Oh no
[00:26.41]It's just the nearness of you
[00:34.52]
[00:39.49]It isn't your sweet conversation
[00:48.31]That brings this sensation
[00:57.06]Oh no
[01:01.94]It's just the nearness of you
[01:09.76]
[01:12.44]When you're in my arms
[01:19.66]And I feel you so close to me
[01:32.20]All my wildest dreams
[01:38.65]Come true
[01:44.40]
[01:47.85]I need no soft lights to enchant me
[01:59.40]If you'll only grant me
[02:08.21]The right
[02:13.47]To hold you ever so tight
[02:22.12]And to feel in the night
[02:32.57]The nearness of you.
