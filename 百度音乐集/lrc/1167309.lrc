[00:03.37]Norah Jones
[00:04.88]
[00:08.32]Like a flower waiting to bloom
[00:18.68]Like a lightbulb in a dark room
[00:26.95]I'm just sitting here waiting for you
[00:33.14]To come home and turn me on
[00:38.82]
[00:43.37]Like the desert waiting for the rain
[00:52.66]Like a school kid waiting for the spring

[01:51.17]
[01:52.16]My hi-fi's waiting for a new tune
[02:00.48]The glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
[02:08.52]I'm just sitting here waiting for you
[02:14.00]To come on home and turn me on
