[00:24.52]It's a rainy night and it's over
[00:31.14]Tears are gonna fall any minute now.
[00:37.15]And I know that it's you I gotta get over
[00:43.81]I know I do but I don't know how.
[00:49.93]
[00:50.87]I pretend that I'm in control now
[00:56.40]I won't fall apart till I walk away.
[01:02.69]And I say to myself you're gonna be stronger
[01:09.23]I tell myself it's better this way.

[01:19.77]no matter how hard you try

[01:38.80]'cause you can't see tears in the rain.
[01:43.58]
[01:44.53]The time has come, I'm letting go now
[01:50.56]I put it all behind me and just turn the page.
[01:56.93]And I'll make you believe that it don't matter
[02:03.15]You'll never see it's all a charade.
