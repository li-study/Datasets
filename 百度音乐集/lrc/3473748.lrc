[00:00.00]    　 The journey
[00:07.35]
[00:08.65]　　 　　唱：911
[00:14.95]
[00:16.43]　Time waits for no one
[00:18.66]　Sure as the tide pulls the ocean
[00:22.52]　Sure as the path that's been chosen cannot be changed
[00:29.73]　In my life's destination
[00:33.81]　I searched for the explanation
[00:38.22]　For some kind of reason
[00:41.33]　For my sorrow and pain
[00:44.85]　But in my isolation
[00:50.37]　I learned to listen
[00:52.78]　To be thankful for the love that I'd been given
[00:59.44]
[00:59.62]　This is my journey
[01:03.28]　Journey through life
[01:06.99]　With every twist and turn I've laughed and cried
[01:12.67]　As the road unwinds
[01:14.53]　This is my journey
[01:18.23]　And I've learned to fight
[01:22.29]　To make me strong enough
[01:25.09]　To lift me up
[01:28.02]　To bring my dreams alive
[01:34.68]
[01:35.03]　In my desperation
[01:37.62]　I swore that never again
[01:41.30]　Would I hear all the laughter of my friends and my family
[01:49.28]　A million tears that I'd cried
[01:54.19]　Then began to dry
[01:57.59]　In the silence of the night time
[02:00.13]　I had came to realize
[02:04.18]　A sweet inspiration filled my horizon
[02:11.91]　Gave me the heart to go on and never would give in
[02:18.20]
[02:18.36]　This is my journey
[02:22.25]　Journey through life
[02:26.13]　With every twist and turn I've laughed and cried
[02:31.48]　As the road unwinds
[02:33.33]　This is my journey
[02:37.06]　And I've learned to fight
[02:40.92]　To make me strong enough
[02:43.87]　To lift me up
[02:46.64]　To bring my dreams alive
[02:53.33]
[02:54.41]　I'm going to love each moment of every day and night
[03:02.34]　I'll look back to the past with the sweetest smile
[03:09.71]　For now I realise
[03:12.66]　I've been given the key to life
[03:15.39]　I've been kissed by the angel by my side
[03:23.87]　Oh..Yeah...
[03:25.51]　This is my journey
[03:29.59]　Journey through life
[03:33.66]　With every twist and turn I've laughed and cried
[03:38.83]　As the road unwinds
[03:40.89]　This is my journey
[03:44.56]　And I've learned to fight
[03:48.63]　To make me strong enough
[03:51.58]　To lift me up
[03:54.35]　To bring my dreams alive
[04:01.74]　To bring my dreams alive
[04:09.14]　To bring my dreams alive......
