[00:01.22]Sarah Brightman - Child in a Manger
[00:02.62]
[00:06.02]Child in the manger, infant of Mary,
[00:16.43]Outcast and Stranger, Lord of us all,
[00:26.62]Child Who inherits all our transgressions,
[00:36.92]All our demerits upon Him fall.
[00:46.17]
[00:48.97]Once the most holy Child of salvation
[00:59.24]Gently and lowly lived here below.
[01:09.61]Now as our glorious mighty Redeemer,
[01:19.86]See Him victorious over each foe.
[01:29.01]
[01:45.62]Prophets foretold Him, Infant of wonder;
[01:55.70]Angels behold Him on His throne.
[02:06.27]Worthy our Savior of all our praises;
[02:16.67]Happy forever are His own.
[02:59.29]
