[00:08.19]She said "let it slide"
[00:10.02]All the things that I
[00:11.97]Have running through my mind
[00:14.17]Will all be gone in time
[00:16.68]Remember son
[00:18.42]All the things you've done
[00:20.65]And all the things you've lost
[00:22.86]And all the things you've won
[00:24.59]
[00:25.39]We're just trying to find some color in this
[00:30.50]Black and white world
[00:33.43]
[00:34.60]Tell me everything will be alright
[00:38.94]Walk this way with me into the night
[00:43.26]You can let it slide
[00:45.24]Baby just for the night
[00:46.80]Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes
[00:50.59]
[00:51.12]She said "take your time"
[00:52.86]Things will be just fine
[00:55.01]Don't bite the hand that feeds
[00:56.83]'Cause nothing's ever mine
[00:59.54]And just wait your turn
[01:01.46]And always try to learn
[01:03.54]To love the ones that don't show love in return
[01:07.71]
[01:08.26]We're just trying to find some color in this
[01:13.23]Black and white world
[01:16.87]
[01:17.60]Tell me everything will be alright
[01:21.72]Walk this way with me into the night
[01:26.10]You can let it slide
[01:28.04]Baby just for the night
[01:29.66]Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes
[01:33.11]
[01:36.10]When you're walking backwards
[01:40.33]Don't be afraid to close your eyes
[01:44.62]'Cause the truth is, darling
[01:47.43]That everything will be alright (alright)
[01:52.56]
[02:09.02]Tell me everything (tell me anything)
[02:13.35]Walk this way with me (just tell me everything)
[02:17.51]'Cause you can let it slide
[02:19.52]Baby just for the night
[02:21.34]Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes
[02:24.68]
[02:26.09]Tell me everything will be alright
[02:30.35]Walk this way with me into the night
[02:34.64]You can let it slide
[02:36.59]Baby just for the night
[02:38.22]Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes
[02:41.86]
[02:42.80]Oh yeah, everyone feels cheated sometimes
[02:46.87]Yeah we all feel a little fucked up sometimes
[02:51.75]
[03:39.50]The End
