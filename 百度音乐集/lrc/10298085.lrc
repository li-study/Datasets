[00:06.23][00:10.60][03:47.36][03:47.56]
[00:11.58]Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
[00:18.89]Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
[00:26.18]Mama, can you help me try to understand
[00:29.66]Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
[00:33.28]My daddy lived a lie
[00:34.96]Its just the price that he paid
[00:37.01]Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
[00:41.12][01:47.12][02:49.67]Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
[00:45.95][01:52.10][02:54.55]That gets me through the night
[00:48.20][01:54.44][02:56.88]I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
[00:53.24][01:59.43][03:01.80]I'm gonna live my life
[00:55.52][02:01.61][03:04.14]Shining like a diamond
[00:57.33][02:03.43][03:05.95]Rolling with the dice
[00:59.11][02:05.20][03:07.78]Standing on the ledge
[01:00.73][02:06.83][03:09.29]Just show the wind how to fly
[01:02.83][02:08.94][03:11.41]When the world gets in my face
[01:06.01][02:12.13][03:14.60]I say, have a nice day
[01:11.51][02:17.67][03:20.02][03:23.77][03:42.12][03:45.83]Have a nice day
[01:15.81]Take a look around you, nothings what it seems
[01:22.90]We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
[01:30.49]Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
[01:34.22]Everybody, brave enough to take a stand
[01:37.51]I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
[01:41.53]Looking for forgiveness
[01:43.07]What’s left to believe?
[02:46.00]Ohhh~
[03:27.94]Now when this world keeps trying, to drag me down
[03:31.53]I've gotta raise my hands
[03:33.36]Gonna stand my ground
[03:35.11]I say, hey, have a nice day
[03:47.38]
