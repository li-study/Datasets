[00:12.87]Miss independent
[00:15.29]Miss self-sufficient
[00:17.16]Miss keep your distance
[00:21.37]
[00:23.47]Miss unafraid
[00:26.01]Miss out of my way
[00:28.03]Miss don't let a man interfere, no
[00:33.30]
[00:34.31]Miss on her own
[00:36.84]Miss almost grown
[00:38.61]Miss never let a man help her off her throne
[00:43.30]So, by keeping her heart protected
[00:46.52]She'd never ever feel rejected
[00:49.33]Little miss apprehensive
[00:51.70]Said ooh, she fell in love
[00:54.41]
[00:54.84]What is the feelin' takin' over?
[00:57.70]Thinkin' no one could open my door
[01:00.28]Surprise...It's time
[01:02.89]To feel what's real
[01:05.73]What happened to Miss Independent?

[01:11.36]Goodbye, old you
[01:14.12]When love is true
[01:16.85]
[01:23.35]Misguided heart
[01:25.74]Miss play it smart
[01:27.27]Miss if you want to use
[01:29.13]that line you better not start, no
[01:33.72]But she miscalculated
[01:36.15]She didn't want to end up jaded
[01:38.52]And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
[01:43.09]So, by changing her misconceptions
[01:46.31]She went in a new direction
[01:49.01]And found inside she felt a connection
[01:52.06]She fell in love.
[01:54.69]What is the feelin' takin' over?
[01:57.30]Thinkin' no one could open my door (open my door)

[02:13.88]When love, when love is true
[02:17.20]When Miss Independence walked away
[02:22.84]No time for love that came her way
[02:28.15]She looked in the mirror and thought today
[02:33.66]What happened to miss no longer afraid?
[02:38.67]It took some time for her to see
[02:44.47]How beautiful love could truly be
[02:49.55]No more talk of why can't that be me
[02:54.72]I'm so glad I finally feel...
