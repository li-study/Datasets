[00:08.40]
[00:10.37]Come to me
[00:14.54]Before you say goodbye
[00:20.84]Hold me close
[00:24.59]Before I start to cry
[00:27.75]
[00:29.83]I will miss you more
[00:34.69]Than you can ever know
[00:39.66]So kiss me once again
[00:44.74]Before you go
[00:47.62]
[00:49.25]I long with all my heart
[00:55.60]For you to stay with me
[01:01.79]But I know
[01:05.29]That this can never be
[01:08.47]
[01:10.90]Only yesterday
[01:15.60]You said we'd never part
[01:19.74]And now you leave me forsaken
[01:23.65]Along with this ache in my heart
[01:28.50]
[01:31.16]Though our love is an ember
[01:34.65]My darling remember
[01:37.12]I love you so
[01:40.39]
[01:42.55]Just kiss me once again
[01:47.23]Before you go
[01:52.19]Before you leave me now
[01:57.27]Before you go
[02:00.75]
[02:02.72]Though our love is an ember
[02:05.99]My darling remember
[02:08.66]I love you so
[02:11.70]
[02:14.39]Just kiss me once again
[02:19.23]Before you go
[02:23.65]Before you leave me now
[02:28.94]Before you go
[02:39.37]
