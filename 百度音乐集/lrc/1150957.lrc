[00:00.00]Sheryl Crow - Wildflower
[00:10.18]
[00:12.18]Quiet EYES
[00:15.75]You have always been my wildflower
[00:21.64]Showing up wherever beauty's lost its way
[00:28.61]Your heart must break
[00:32.34]
[00:35.62]I was free
[00:39.12]Until I heard the song you sang me
[00:45.65]Pulling me away from everything I knew
[00:52.16]To be with you
[00:55.90]
[00:57.43]And everything I know just fades away
[01:02.97]And every time you go it hurts me so
[01:08.84]I don't know why WHEN I know we're free
[01:20.84]Free to fly
[01:24.53]
[01:34.22]Here we are
[01:37.71]Burning faster than the CLOSEST star
[01:43.56]Falling back down to the Earth
[01:46.84]I love you so it sometimes hurts
[01:53.28]
[01:57.56]Closer still
[02:01.10]You will find me standing on the hill
[02:06.95]Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide
[02:14.02]Now, come inside
[02:18.05]
[02:19.17]And everything I know just fades away
[02:24.95]And every time you go it hurts me so
[02:30.82]I don't know why WHEN I know we're free
[02:42.77]Free to fly
[02:46.79]
[03:05.93]And everything I know just fades away
[03:11.77]And where the wildflower grows it picks its space
[03:17.61]And that's the way it is when nature plays its lovely hand
[03:29.31]We'll understand everything
[03:40.63]
[03:42.34]Everything, everything
[03:50.96]
