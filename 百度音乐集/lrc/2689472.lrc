[00:25.00]A black swan
[00:27.00]Is born that night
[00:29.00]The misty pond
[00:31.00](Has) got a new king
[00:35.00]Got a new king
[00:39.00]So what can we do
[00:41.00]With our lives
[00:43.00]When it all begins
[00:47.00]It\'s hard and
[00:48.00]It\'s cruel
[00:49.00]Will grace die in pain?
[00:51.00]Will light ever rise again?
[00:55.00]
[00:58.00]I\'m trapped in darkness
[01:03.00]Still I reach out for the stars
[01:07.00]I\'m moving in silence
[01:11.00]I leave it all far behind
[01:13.00]
[01:21.00]Oh at dawn
[01:23.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[01:29.00]Oh at dawn
[01:31.00]I\'ll pray at the edge of thorns
[01:37.00]Oh at dawn
[01:39.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[01:44.00]
[02:03.00]Let us march on
[02:05.00]To the fields of sacrifice
[02:09.00](I\'m) wondering why
[02:13.00]I\'ll carry on
[02:17.00]Will I betray myself to rise
[02:23.00]In the silence
[02:24.00]It\'s time to explain
[02:28.00]Search for truth in lies
[02:33.00]Useful lies
[02:36.00]Needless love\'s damned
[02:38.00]What can we do with our lives
[02:40.00]When it all begins
[02:46.00]Come follow me
[02:47.00]And you will see
[02:48.00]How it will be
[02:49.00]When all the pain is gone away
[02:53.00]Oh at dawn
[02:55.00]I\'ll pray at the edge of thorns
[03:01.00]Oh at dawn
[03:03.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[03:09.00]Oh at dawn
[03:11.00]I\'ll pray at the edge of thorns
[03:17.00]Oh at dawn
[03:19.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[03:25.00]
[04:15.00]Let us march on
[04:17.00]Though there\'s no hope at our side
[04:23.00]Let us be brave
[04:25.00]Though by glory we are denied
[04:30.00]But don\'t you think
[04:31.00]It\'s time for us
[04:32.00]To bring to an end
[04:35.00]Come play the song of death
[04:40.00]The wisdom in us both
[04:42.00]Will make it
[04:43.00]Special guaranteed
[04:45.00]Come play the song of death
[04:51.00]I\'m lost in the depths of his eyes
[04:53.00]I can\'t flee
[04:54.00]Inner pain caused insanity
[04:57.00]It\'s deep within
[04:59.00]The fear and the hunger
[05:01.00]Enslaved and denied
[05:03.00]By my love and my enemies
[05:05.00]I\'m the illgotten son
[05:08.00]
[05:14.00]Oh at dawn
[05:16.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[05:22.00]Oh at dawn
[05:24.00]I\'ll pray at the edge of thorns
[05:30.00]Oh at dawn
[05:32.00]I\'ll face the edge of thorns
[05:38.00]
