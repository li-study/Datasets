[00:06.51]
[00:06.85]How I remember sleepless nights
[00:12.75]When we would read by candlelight,
[00:19.74]And on the windowpane outside
[00:25.69]A new world made of snow;
[00:30.19]
[00:30.80]A million feathers falling down,
[00:35.92]A million stars that touch the ground,
[00:43.05]So many secrets to be found
[00:49.42]Amid the falling snow.
[00:54.21]
[00:55.52]Maybe I am falling down.
[00:59.95]Tell me should I touch the ground?
[01:04.72]Maybe I won't make a sound
[01:09.82]In the darkness all around.
[01:17.92]
[01:19.65]The silence of a winter's night
[01:24.47]Brings memories I hold inside;
[01:31.54]Remembering a blue moonlight
[01:37.81]Upon the fallen snow.
[01:42.68]
[02:06.63]Maybe I am falling down.
[02:11.00]Tell me should I touch the ground?
[02:15.75]Maybe I won't make a sound
[02:20.84]In the darkness all around.
[02:29.15]
[02:30.76]I close my window to the night.
[02:35.73]I leave the sky her tears of white.
[02:42.75]And all is lit by candlelight
[02:49.08]Amid the falling snow.
[02:55.28]And all is lit by candlelight
[03:01.58]Amid the falling snow.
