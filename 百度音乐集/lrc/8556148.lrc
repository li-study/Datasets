[00:03.70]Album: Wonderland
[00:11.65][00:20.57][03:13.33][03:21.37]
[00:21.31]When everything is going wrong
[00:23.54]And things are just a little strange
[00:26.29]Cos' for so long now
[00:27.81]You've forgotten how to smile
[00:33.51]And overhead the skies are clear
[00:35.43]But it still seems to rain on you
[00:38.53]And your only friends
[00:39.99]All have better things to do
[00:44.24][00:50.35][01:26.94][01:33.05][02:29.45][02:35.67]When you're down and lost
[00:47.61][01:30.32][02:32.92]And you need a helping hand
[00:53.20][01:35.91][02:38.46]Along the way
[00:55.65][01:46.05][02:13.50][02:48.61]Oh, just tell yourself
[00:57.26][01:47.67][02:09.05][02:15.15][02:50.21][02:56.25][03:02.37]I, I'll be OK
[01:04.01]Now things are only getting worse
[01:05.96]And you need someone to take the blame
[01:09.07]When your lover's gone
[01:10.45]There's no-one to share the pain
[01:16.25]You're sleeping with the TV on
[01:18.10]And you're lying in an empty bed
[01:21.19]All the alcohol in the world
[01:23.43]Would never help me to forget
[01:38.36]Just try a little harder
[01:41.46][02:44.04]Try your best to make it
[01:43.70][02:46.16]Through the day
[01:54.06][01:57.20][02:00.17]You're not alone
[01:55.75][01:58.72](You're not alone)
[02:07.75]Just tell yourself
[02:19.61]Won't you tell yourself
[02:21.25]I, I...
[02:41.01]Try a little harder
