[00:27.00]There's the moon asking to stay
[00:31.06]Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
[00:37.86]Though it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
[00:49.23]My fading voice sings of love,
[01:00.31]But she cries to the clicking of time,
[01:08.40]Of time
[01:12.01]
[01:12.78]Wait in the fire...
[01:28.42]
[01:57.39]And she weeps on my arm
[02:01.31]Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
[02:05.94]Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow,oh my love
[02:20.04]And the rain is falling and I believe
[02:26.65]My time has come
[02:31.01]It reminds me of the pain I might leave
[02:37.97]Leave behind
[02:41.03]
[02:42.28]Wait in the fire...
[02:57.33]
[04:09.85]And I feel them drown my name
[04:13.82]So easy to know and forget with this kiss
[04:20.98]But I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
[04:35.30]
[04:43.81]Wait in the fire...
