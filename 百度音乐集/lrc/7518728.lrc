[00:06.06]leave night ,
[00:08.59]Not a sound from the pavement
[00:12.89]Has the moon lost her memory
[00:17.32]She is smiling alone
[00:22.55]In the lamplight
[00:25.50]The withered leaves collect at my feet
[00:31.32]And the wind begins to moan
[00:38.81]Memory,
[00:41.34]all alone in the moonlight
[00:45.54]I can drink of  the old days
[00:49.63]Life was beautiful then
[00:54.75]I remember the time I knew what happiness was
[01:03.79]Let the memory live again
[01:11.56]Every street lamp seems to beat
[01:17.91]A fatalistic warning
[01:24.95]Someone mutters
[01:27.85]and the street lamp sputters
[01:32.32]and Soon it will be morning
[01:40.03]Daylight
[01:42.77]I must wait for the sunrise
[01:46.59]I must think of a new life
[01:50.96]and I mustn't give in
[01:55.46]When the dawn comes
[01:58.33]Tonight will be a memory too
[02:03.91]And a new day will begin
[02:25.10]Burnt out ends of smoky days
[02:32.81]The stale court smell of morning
[02:39.14]A street lamp dies
[02:42.11]Another night is over
[02:47.10]Another day is dawning
[02:54.64]Touch me,
[02:57.28] It is so easy to leave me
[03:01.79]All alone with the memory
[03:06.26]Of my days in the sun
[03:11.40]If you'll touch me,
[03:14.77]You'll understand what happiness is Look,
[03:22.08]a new day has begun...
