[03:25.28][02:45.97][01:24.69][00:43.58]She comes in colors ev'rywhere,
[03:28.48][02:49.18][01:28.00][00:46.83]She combs her hair
[03:30.68][02:51.35][01:30.17][00:49.03]She's like a rainbow,
[03:34.19][02:55.01][01:33.83][00:52.68]Coming, colors in the air
[03:37.18][02:58.05][01:36.82][00:55.79]Oh, everywhere, she comes in colors
[03:43.03][03:03.95][01:42.24][01:00.78]
[02:28.09]Have you seen her dressed in blue?
[02:33.09]See the sky in front of you
[02:37.55]And her face is like a sail,
[02:39.78]Speck of white so fair and pale
[02:41.95]Have you seen a lady fairer?
[03:08.24]Have you seen her all in gold?
[03:12.60]Like a queen in days of old
[03:16.88]She shoots her colors all around
[03:19.15]Like a sunset going down
[03:21.23]Have you seen a lady fairer?
[04:09.75]She's like a rainbow,
[04:13.18]Coming, colors in the air
[04:16.27]Oh, everywhere, she comes in colors
