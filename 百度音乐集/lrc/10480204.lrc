[00:00.00]Brand New Day
[00:04.50]Sting
[00:14.50]
[01:00.13]How many of you people out there
[01:02.04]Been hurt in some kind of love affair
[01:04.27]And how many times did you swear
[01:06.26]That you'd never love again
[01:07.69]
[01:09.32]How many lonely, sleepless nights?
[01:11.23]How many lies, how many fights?
[01:13.15]And why would you want to
[01:14.28]Put yourself through all of that again?
[01:16.36]
[01:18.39]"Love is pain," I hear you say
[01:20.50]Love has a cruel and bitter way of
[01:22.42]Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
[01:27.41]How could it be that what you need the most
[01:29.69]Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
[01:31.72]You never want to feel so sad and lost again
[01:34.64]
[01:36.71]One day you could be looking
[01:38.41]Through an old book in rainy weather
[01:40.67]You see a picture of her smiling at you
[01:42.87]When you were still together
[01:44.94]Or you could be walking down the street
[01:47.43]And who should you chance to meet
[01:49.62]But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
[01:53.06]
[01:54.09]Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey
[01:56.88]I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
[01:59.27]We're starting up a brand new day
[02:02.15]
[02:03.81]Turn the clock all the way back
[02:06.00]I wonder if she'll take me back
[02:08.21]I'm thinking in a brand new way
[02:11.29]
[02:13.03]Turn the clock to zero, sister
[02:14.82]You'll never know how much I missed her
[02:17.47]I'm starting up a brand new day
[02:22.06]Turn the clock to zero, boss
[02:24.25]The river's wide, we'll swim across
[02:26.65]We're starting up a brand new day
[02:29.82]
[02:31.38]It could happen to you,
[02:33.27]Just like it happened to me,
[02:35.56]There's simply no immunity
[02:37.41]There's no guarantee.
[02:39.60]I say love's such a force if you find yourself in it
[02:44.41]You need some time for reflection
[02:45.93]You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
[02:49.52]Wait a minute, wait a minute
[02:51.82]Wait a minute, wait a minute
[02:54.14]Turn the clock to zero, honey
[02:56.18]I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
[02:58.43]We're starting up a brand new day
[03:03.26]Turn the clock to zero, Mac
[03:05.43]I'm begging her to take me back
[03:07.80]I'm thinking in a brand new way
[03:11.28]
[03:12.44]Turn the clock to zero, boss
[03:14.52]The river's wide, we'll swim across
[03:17.00]We're starting up a brand new day
[03:21.56]Turn the clock to zero buddy
[03:23.69]Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
[03:26.09]Started up a brand new day
[03:29.15]
[03:30.43]I'm the rhythm in your tune
[03:32.64]I'm the sun and you're the moon
[03:35.03]I'm the bat and you're the cave
[03:37.16]You're the beach and I'm the wave
[03:39.40]I'm the plow and you're the land
[03:41.85]You're the glove and I'm the hand
[03:43.81]I'm the train and you're the station
[03:46.27]I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah
[03:50.15]
[04:07.25]I'm the present to your future
[04:09.25]You're the wound and I'm the suture
[04:11.45]You're the magnet to my pole
[04:13.70]I'm the devil in your soul
[04:16.12]You're the pupil I'm the teacher
[04:18.31]You're the church and I'm the preacher
[04:20.72]You're the flower I'm the rain
[04:22.80]You're the tunnel I'm the train
[04:24.99]Stand up all you lovers in the world
[04:29.86]Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
[04:34.19]Stand up all you lovers in the world
[04:39.27]Starting up a brand new day
[04:42.18]
[04:43.60]You're the crop to my rotation
[04:45.96]You're the sum of my equation
[04:48.14]I'm the answer to your question
[04:50.40]If you follow my suggestion
[04:52.77]We can turn this ship around
[04:54.91]We'll go up instead of down
[04:57.24]You're the pan and I'm the handle
[04:59.61]You're the flame and I'm the candle
[05:01.68]Stand up all you lovers in the world
[05:05.27]
