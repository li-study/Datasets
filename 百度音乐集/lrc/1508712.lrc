[00:05.63]Parachutes
[00:06.92]
[00:08.44]Pearl Jam lyrics
[00:10.00]
[00:11.55]Why deny
[00:15.37]All the troubles when combined
[00:20.78]with the missing links
[00:23.06]It don't feel like
[00:26.95]Home now,...
[00:30.21]
[00:30.76]The you're gone
[00:32.27]All the troubles
[00:35.41]Suddenly explained infinitum
[00:40.65]You're always wishing and
[00:43.50]Never here at home.
[00:47.50]
[00:48.47]You
[00:50.79]All the dreams we shared and
[00:54.99]Lights we turned on
[00:59.75]But the house is getting dark
[01:04.14]
[01:04.48]Ans I don't want to know your past
[01:10.42]But together share the dawn
[01:15.33]And I won't need
[01:22.37]
[01:23.04]Nothing else
[01:24.41]Cause when we're dead
[01:26.15]We would've had it all
[01:32.08]
[01:33.01]And died
[01:36.11]I would've fallen from the sky
[01:38.89]Til you
[01:40.83]Parachutes have opened now
[01:46.18]
[01:51.73]Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
[01:57.37]Come so low with the kneeling
[02:02.35]Please know that
[02:06.12]I got
[02:08.34]
[02:09.10]All the feelings I'm needing
[02:13.26]Before my light goes out
[02:17.93]As the doors are closing now
[02:22.55]
[02:23.45]And far away will be my home
[02:28.77]And to grasp this, I don't know
[02:33.30]And I don't need
[02:40.60]
[02:41.25]Further back and forth, A wave will break on me today
[02:52.50]And love,... wish the world could go again with love
[02:59.42]One can't seem to have enough
[03:05.22]And war,... break the sky and tell me what it's for
[03:19.05]And love,... what a different life
[03:24.82]Had I not found this love with you
