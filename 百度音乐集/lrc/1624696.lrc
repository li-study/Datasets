[00:04.05]《Girl All The Bad Guys Want 》
[00:06.00]
[00:11.90]8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin'
[00:15.39]To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me.
[00:19.00]Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring,
[00:22.54]She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means.
[00:26.70]And when she walks,
[00:29.03]All the wind blows and the angels sing.
[00:33.17]She doesn't notice me!
[00:36.06]Cause she is watchin' wrestling
[00:38.05]Creamin' over tough guys
[00:39.65]Listenin' to rap metal
[00:41.47]Turntables in her eyes
[00:43.19]It's like a bad movie
[00:45.10]She is lookin' through me
[00:46.89]If you were me, then you'd be
[00:48.80]Screamin' "Someone shoot me!"
[00:50.57]As I fail miserably,
[00:52.37]Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.
[00:56.72]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[01:03.08]She likes the godsmack and I like agent orange
[01:06.57]Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
[01:10.27]She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
[01:13.57]She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have
[01:18.13]And when she walks,
[01:20.20]All the wind blows and the angels sing.
[01:24.68]She'll never notice me!
[01:27.57]Cause she is watchin' wrestling
[01:29.30]Creamin' over tough guys
[01:31.17]Listenin' to rap metal
[01:32.92]Turntables in her eyes
[01:34.74]She likes 'em with a mustache
[01:36.44]Racetrack season pass
[01:38.45]Drivin' in a Trans-Am
[01:40.20]Does a mullet make a man?
[01:42.04]It's like a bad movie
[01:44.04]She is lookin' through me
[01:45.69]If you were me, then you'd be
[01:47.50]Screamin' "Someone shoot me!"
[01:49.30]As I fail miserably,
[01:51.12]Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.
[01:55.27]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[01:58.91]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[02:02.56]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[02:09.91]There she goes again
[02:12.09]With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
[02:16.78]She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
[02:21.07]All I wanted was to see her naked!
[02:26.06]Now I am watchin' wrestling
[02:27.67]Tryin' to be a tough guy
[02:29.53]Listenin' to rap metal
[02:31.27]Turntables in my eyes
[02:33.06]I can't grow a mustache
[02:34.78]And I ain't got no season pass
[02:36.74]All I got's a moped...moped....moped.....
[02:40.94]It's like a bad movie
[02:42.61]She is lookin' through me
[02:44.35]If you were me, then you'd be
[02:46.20]Screamin' "Someone shoot me!"
[02:48.07]As I fail miserably,
[02:49.86]Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.
[02:53.93]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[02:57.68]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[03:01.29]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[03:04.93]She's the girl all the bad guys want! (There she goes again)
[03:08.93]She's the girl all the bad guys want!
[03:12.26]She's the girl all the bad guys want! (There she goes again)
