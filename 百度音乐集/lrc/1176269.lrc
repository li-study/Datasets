[00:31.78]blue, blue caravan
[00:36.32]winding down to the valley of lights
[00:41.99]my true love is a man
[00:46.82]who would hold me for 10,000 nights
[00:51.39]
[00:52.09]in the wild, wild wailing wind
[00:57.59]he's a house in the soft yellow moon
[01:01.91]so blue, blue caravan
[01:08.30]won't you carry me down to him, soon?
[01:13.47]
[01:33.32]blue, blue caravan
[01:38.11]won't you drive away all of these tears?
[01:43.67]my true love is a man
[01:48.72]that I haven't seen in years
[01:53.37]
[01:53.87]he said:
[01:54.15]"go where you have to
[01:56.74]for I belong to you until my dying day,"
[02:03.68]so like a fool, blue caravan, I believed him
[02:11.33]and I walked away
[02:26.75]
[02:33.66]oh, my blue, blue caravan
[02:38.31]oh, the highway is my great wall
[02:43.76]my true love is man
[02:49.41]who never existed at all
[02:53.81]
[02:55.39]oh, he was a beautiful fiction
[03:00.15]I invented to keep out the cold
[03:05.35]and now my blue, blue caravan
[03:10.84]I can feel my heart growing old
[03:15.63]oh, my blue, blue caravan
[03:20.99]I can feel my heart growing old...
