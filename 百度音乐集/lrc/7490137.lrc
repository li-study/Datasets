[00:08.97]
[00:10.76]I, I'm so in love with you
[00:18.57]Whatever you want to do
[00:23.57]Is all right with me
[00:29.65]'Cause you make me feel so brand new
[00:39.30]And I want to spend my life with you
[00:47.57]
[00:48.84] Since, since we've been together
[00:57.02] Loving you forever
[01:01.87] Is what I need
[01:07.58] Let me be the one you come running to
[01:16.93] I'll never be untrue
[01:22.95]
[03:00.10][01:26.29] Let's, let's stay together
[03:08.81][01:34.90] Lovin' you whether, whether
[03:13.14][01:39.71] Times are good or bad, happy or sad
[01:44.66]
[01:58.75] Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
[02:03.89] Why, why some people break up
[02:11.74] Then turn around and make up
[02:17.07] I just can't see
[02:22.50] You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
[02:32.51] Staying around you is all I see
[02:39.77] (Here's what I want us to do)
[02:42.04]Let's, we oughta stay together
[02:49.63] Loving you whether, whether
[02:54.81] Times are good or bad, happy or sad
