[00:49.97]show me show me show me
[00:51.05]how you do that trick
[00:53.06]the one that makes me scream
[00:55.38]she said
[00:56.53]the one that makes me laugh
[00:58.79]she said
[00:59.62]and threw her arms around my neck
[01:02.40]
[01:02.86]show me how you do it
[01:05.51]and i promise you
[01:07.02]i promise that i'll run away with you
[01:11.08]i'll run away with you
[01:16.38]
[01:40.33]spinning on that dizzy edge
[01:43.43]i kissed her face and kissed her head
[01:46.49]and dreamed of all the different ways i had
[01:49.85]to make her glow
[01:52.74]why are you so far away?
[01:55.57]she said
[01:56.43]why won't you ever know that i'm in love with you?
[02:01.90]that i'm in love with you?
[02:03.83]
[02:05.40]you
[02:07.06]soft and only
[02:08.52]you
[02:10.11]lost and lonely
[02:11.62]you
[02:13.18]strange as angels
[02:14.80]dancing in the deepest oceans
[02:17.91]twisting in the water
[02:20.36]you're just like a dream...
[02:23.45]you're just like a dream...
[02:25.82]
[02:46.93]daylight licked me into shape
[02:50.06]i must have been asleep for days
[02:53.18]and moving lips to breathe her name
[02:56.23]i opened up my eyes
[02:59.50]and found myself alone
[03:01.59]alone
[03:02.37]alone
[03:03.20]above a raging sea
[03:05.86]that stole the only girl i loved
[03:08.71]and drowned her deep inside of me
[03:11.88]
[03:12.32]you
[03:13.83]soft and only
[03:15.35]you
[03:16.91]lost and lonely
[03:18.51]you
[03:20.04]just like heaven
