[00:15.00]Dance Of Death
[00:23.04]Edited By AF
[00:31.09]Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
[00:36.64]'bout a thing that I saw
[00:41.57]One night wandering in the everglades
[00:46.36]I'd one drink but no more
[00:50.99]I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
[00:55.96]Gazing up at the stars
[01:00.99]Not aware of a presence so near to me
[01:04.65]Watching my every move
[01:09.46]Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
[01:14.48]As something rushed me from the trees
[01:18.71]Took me to an unholy place
[01:23.67]And that is where I fell from grace
[01:29.12]Then they summoned me over to join in with them
[01:33.21]To the dance of the dead
[01:37.33]In to the circle of fire I followed them
[01:41.71]In to the middle I was led
[01:52.02]As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
[01:56.15]But still I wanted to go
[02:02.77]And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
[02:09.42]As I walked onto the coals
[02:15.49]And I felt I was in a trance
[02:18.81]And my spirit was lifted from me
[02:26.56]And if only someone had the chance
[02:30.07]To witness what happened to me
[02:36.53]And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
[02:41.28]All had death in their eyes
[02:47.52]Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
[02:51.84]They had ascended from hell
[03:31.39]As I danced with the dead
[03:33.48]my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
[03:38.86]Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead
[03:46.43]Until the time came to reunite us both
[03:50.23]My spirit came back down to me
[03:55.02]I didn't know if I was alive or dead
[03:57.80]As the others, all joined in with me
[04:18.07]By luck then a skirmish started
[04:18.66]And took the attention away from me
[04:21.83]When they took their gaze from me
[04:22.76]Was the moment that I fled
[04:25.67]I ran like hell faster than the wind
[04:26.92]But behind I did not glance
[04:29.72]One thing that I did not dare
[04:31.01]Was to look just straight ahead
[06:15.42]When you know that your time has come around
[06:17.31]You know you'll be prepared for it
[06:22.11]Say your last goodbyes to everyone
[06:25.74]Drink and say a prayer for it
[07:12.21]When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
[07:13.82]And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
[07:15.99]When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
[07:17.55]And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
[08:06.96]To this day I guess I'll never know
[08:11.76]Just why they let me go
[08:16.89]But I'll never go dancing no more
[08:21.54]'Til I dance with the dead
