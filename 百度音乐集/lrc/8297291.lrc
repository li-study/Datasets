[00:08.58]Disco dancing with the lights down low
[00:14.21]Beats are pumping on the stereo
[00:20.06]Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
[00:25.50]Your sayin' crank the bass I gotta get some more
[00:32.21]Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
[00:35.12]Got a feelin' its a mixed up sign
[00:37.97]I can see it in my own reflection
[00:40.85]Something funnies goin' on inside my mind
[00:43.90]Don't know what its pushin' me higher

[01:06.83]Out to the electric night
[01:09.28]Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
[01:12.52]The beat goes around and round
[01:15.16]Its the sound of the under
[01:17.54]Sound of the underground
[01:24.33]Chain reaction running through my veins
[01:30.02]Pumps the bass line up into my brains
[01:35.66]Screws my mind until I lose control
[01:41.13]And when the building rocks I know Its got my soul
[01:47.87]Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
