[00:18.83]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[00:24.27]It must have been something you said
[00:27.45]I just died in your arms tonight
[00:31.62]
[00:41.84]I keep looking for something
[00:44.08]I can\'t get broken hearts lie all around me
[00:48.94]And i don\'t see an easy way to get out of this
[00:56.65]Her diary it sits on the bedside table
[01:00.53]The curtains are closed
[01:02.48]The cats in the cradle who would\'ve thought
[01:05.69]That a boy like me could come to this
[01:09.27]
[01:10.39]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[01:17.66]It must\'ve been something you said
[01:20.87]I just died in your arms tonight
[01:25.61]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[01:31.61]
[01:33.03]It must\'ve been some kind of kiss i should\'ve walked away
[01:40.96]i should\'ve walked away
[01:42.57]
[01:53.88]Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
[01:58.17]On the surface i\'m a name on a list i try to be discreet
[02:05.38]But then blow it again
[02:08.60]I\'ve lost and found
[02:10.98]It\'s my final mistake she\'s loving by proxy
[02:14.83]No give and all take \'cos i\'ve been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.
[02:22.92]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[02:30.27]It must\'ve been something you said
[02:33.48]I just died in your arms tonight
[02:39.12]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[02:45.38]It must\'ve been some kind of kiss i should\'ve walked away
[02:53.59]i should\'ve walked away
[02:56.62]It was a long hot night she made it easy
[03:00.54]She made it feel right
[03:03.12]But now it\'s over the moment has gone
[03:06.28]I followed my hands not my head
[03:09.16]I know i was wrong
[03:11.20]
[03:25.71]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[03:31.27]It must\'ve been something you said
[03:34.55]I just died in your arms tonight
[03:40.41]Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
[03:46.46]It must\'ve been some kind of kiss i should\'ve walked away
[03:54.57]i should\'ve walked away
