[00:10.85]Here's a lullaby, for anyone who wants to fly,
[00:19.02]from their hometown where people drown,
[00:24.20]and where the townies die.
[00:30.14]This old library, has thirty books and one dictionary.
[00:37.36]But thats ok, no one reads anyway,
[00:41.75]we all watch tv.
[00:49.61]So here's your lullaby.
[00:54.03]No girl, don't cry.
[00:58.44]Just rest your head and go to bed,
[01:04.78]your time will come to fly...
[01:10.69]away.
[01:12.20]Never today, just dream your life away.
[01:20.78]Sleep
[01:52.07]All the dogs will die.
[01:55.89]They just can't seem to stay alive.
[02:00.26]Cause in this town, our cop shoots them down.
[02:05.13]And we just let him go and sigh.
[02:10.61]Please god, please.
[02:14.27]Whats happened to our dreams?
[02:19.52]We're losing hope, so we invest in dope
[02:23.46]to feel our vacant feelings
[02:30.61]So here's your lullaby.
[02:35.37]no boy, don't cry.
[02:42.79]Just rest your head and go to bed,
[02:44.97]your time will come to fly...
[02:49.59]away.
[02:51.52]Never today, just dream your life away.
[03:02.78]Sleep
