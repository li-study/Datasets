[00:08.37]I love that how she breathes booze in the mornin'
[00:10.73]Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
[00:14.22]I made a fatal mistake letting her drink again
[00:17.52]Well who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
[00:20.51]And if you could put dumb in a shotglass
[00:22.42]I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
[00:24.51]And we please don't have enough
[00:26.32]I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her,
[00:27.60]'Cause she could do better than me
[00:29.31]She'll come around eventually
[00:32.92]'Cause baby girl's a queen
[00:35.00]And a queen is just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
[00:38.72]And she's made me a fiend
[00:40.78]I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose
[00:45.48]Oh no,
[00:46.73]She's at the bottom of that bottle
[00:50.29]She's only one more swallow
[00:53.74]From being, you know, so hollow
[00:56.30](Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[00:57.49]Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
[00:59.31]She's only one more swallow
[01:10.34]From being, you know, so hollow
[01:11.87]I find it funny she can never find her car keys
[01:14.50]Immediately after telling me she can't take it
[01:17.30]She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
[01:20.33]And slurs her words because she's never not inebrieated
[01:23.14]And the front page that I'd read
[01:25.23]Let the girl go, you know you can do better
[01:26.91]It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her
[01:29.35]Is the reason you sweat her,
[01:30.53]Don't let her take advantage of you
[01:32.24]Like the other girls let her
[01:33.66]You better cut your losses now buddy.
[01:35.74]'Cause baby girl's a queen
[01:38.01]And a queen's a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
[01:41.73]And she's made me a fiend
[01:43.96]I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose
[01:48.44]Oh no,
[01:49.71]She's at the bottom of that bottle
[01:53.25]She's only one more swallow
[01:56.29]From being, you know, so hollow
[01:59.67](Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[02:00.63]Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
[02:05.27]She's only one more swallow
[02:08.31]From being, you know, so hollow
[02:12.62]Drown yourself,
[02:14.73]It's not worth keeping me
[02:17.42]Just put it down right now,
[02:20.24]When bow out gracefully
[02:23.81]('Cause baby girl's a queen
[02:26.28]The queen's the part with a bunch of fancy moves
[02:29.17]And she's made me a fiend
[02:32.75]I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose)
[02:48.46]Oh no,
[02:50.33]She's at the bottom of that bottle
[02:53.37]She's only one more swallow
[02:56.34]From being, you know, so hollow
[02:59.43](Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[03:00.65]Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
[03:05.33]She's only one more swallow
[03:08.55]From being, you know, so hollow
[03:11.47](Hey! Hey! Hey!...)
