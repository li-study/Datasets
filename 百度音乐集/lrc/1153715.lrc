[01:27.28]She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
[01:32.95]In the language that i will never will forget
[01:38.45]I hear her calling
[01:40.11]Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me
[01:42.58]And when she started moving closer and closer
[01:44.85]Does she know that i want her, i want her
[01:47.46]I wanna be with her tonight
