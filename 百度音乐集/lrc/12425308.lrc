[00:27.49]
[00:43.38]The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
[00:47.51]And I'm a house of cards
[00:50.85]Your the kinda reckless that should send me run
[00:55.09]But I kinda know that I won't get far
[00:59.16]
[01:00.20]And you stood there in front of me just
[01:04.34]Close enough to touch
[01:08.51]Close enough to hope you couldn't
[01:12.02]See what I was thinking of
[01:14.39]
[01:14.83]Drop everything now

[01:28.77]Whenever you smile
[01:31.53]Get me with those green eyes

[01:36.91]Give me something that'll haunt me
[01:39.25]When you're not around
[01:41.19]I see Sparks Fly
[01:45.60]Whenever you smile
[01:51.91]
[01:58.46]My mind forgets to remind me
[02:02.55]You're a bad idea
[02:06.80]You touch me once and it's
[02:09.10]Really something you find I'm even better
[02:12.50]Than you imagined I would be
[02:14.91]
[02:15.20]I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
[02:18.44]But with you I know it's no good
[02:22.62]And I could wait patiently but

[03:25.07]And watch the lights go wild
[03:28.84]Just keep on keepin your eyes on me
[03:33.34]It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
[03:37.73]And lead me up the staircase
[03:41.57]Won't you whisper soft and slow
[03:46.21]I'm captivated by you baby
[03:50.62]Like a firework show
[03:53.03]
