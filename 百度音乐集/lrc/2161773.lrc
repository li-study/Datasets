[00:01.99]Photograph
[00:02.02]
[00:02.09]Look at this photograph,
[00:05.02]everytime I do it makes me laugh.
[00:08.10]How did our eyes get so red,
[00:11.38]and what the hell is on Joey's head.
[00:14.78]And this is where I grew up,
[00:17.98]I think the present owner fixed it up.
[00:21.33]I never knew we ever went without,
[00:24.47]the second florr was high for sneaking out.
[00:27.85]And this is where I went to school,
[00:31.12]most of the time had better things to do.
[00:34.39]Criminal record says I broke in twice,
[00:37.58]I must have done it half a dozen times.
[00:41.14]I wonder if its too late,
[00:44.20]should I go back and try to graduate.
[00:47.51]Life's better now than it was back then,
[00:50.87]if I was them I wouldn't let me in!
[00:54.16]Oh oh oh... Oh God I!
[00:57.43]
[00:59.30]Every memory of lookin' out the back door,
[01:01.93]I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
[01:06.01]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[01:09.69]Good-bye good-bye.
[01:12.45]Every memory of walkin' out the front door,
[01:15.07]I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for,
[01:18.72]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[01:23.02]Good-bye good-bye.
[01:26.15]
[01:39.29]We used to listen to the radio,
[01:43.51]and sing along to every song we'd know.
[01:46.71]We said someday we'd find out how it feels,
[01:50.00]to sing to more than just the steering wheel.
[01:53.51]Kim's the first girl I kissed,
[01:56.60]I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
[01:59.89]She's had a couple of kids since then,
[02:03.09]I haven't seen her since god knows when!
[02:06.87]Oh oh oh... Oh God I!
[02:10.48]
[02:11.59]Every memory of lookin' out the back door,
[02:14.37]I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
[02:17.99]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[02:22.03]Good-bye good-bye.
[02:24.87]Every memory of walkin' out the front door,
[02:27.41]I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for,
[02:31.33]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[02:35.20]Good-bye good-bye.
[02:37.95]
[02:45.52]I miss that town,
[02:48.15]I miss the faces,
[02:51.16]cant erase, cant replace it
[02:52.06]I miss it now
[02:54.91]I can't believe it,
[02:56.61]So hard to stay,
[02:57.59]So hard to leave it.
[02:58.53]
[02:59.66]If I could relive those days,
[03:02.40]I know the one thing that would never change.
[03:06.14]
[03:07.82]Every memory of lookin' out the back door,
[03:10.55]I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor,
[03:13.50]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[03:18.04]Good-bye good-bye.
[03:20.85]Every memory of walkin' out the front door,
[03:23.49]I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for,
[03:27.28]It's hard to say it, time to say it,
[03:31.06]Good-bye good-bye.
[03:34.30]
[03:35.86]Look at this photograph,
[03:38.51]everytime I do it makes me laugh.
[03:41.86]Everytime I do it makes me...
