[00:10.77]Westlife - Where We Are
[00:15.99]
[00:29.00]Stay, stay where you are
[00:33.80]I don't let me go, don't let me go
[00:37.19]We made it this far
[00:40.01]
[00:40.95]Oh baby stop, stop right there
[00:46.45]I don't walk away, don't walk away
[00:49.93]Into thin air
[00:52.61]
[00:53.43]We survived a crash
[00:56.22]Made it through the wreckage
[00:59.58]Standing here at last
[01:02.71]So perfectly written
[01:05.90]
[01:06.55]Now where we are
[01:10.62]Is where we're suppose to be
[01:13.26]Where we are
[01:17.12]Keeps the breath in me
[01:19.55]Where we've been
[01:23.46]We've risen from the deep
[01:26.18]Where we're now no one can tear us apart
[01:31.32]That's where we are
[01:35.81]
[01:39.57]Don't, don't turn around
[01:44.11]We gotta let, we got to let
[01:47.58]Go of the past now
[01:51.36]Oh feel me by your side
[01:57.05]We're out of danger
[02:00.11]No reason to hide
[02:03.18]
[02:03.83]We survived the storm
[02:06.71]Made it through the hurricane
[02:09.91]Standing here at last
[02:13.03]Dry despite the rain
[02:15.90]
[02:16.76]And now where we are
[02:21.01]Is where we're suppose to be
[02:23.67]Where we are
[02:27.53]Keeps the breath in me
[02:30.05]Where we've been
[02:33.95]We've risen from the deep
[02:36.41]Where we're now no one can tear us apart
[02:41.82]That's where we are
[02:45.85]
[02:54.90]That's where we are
[03:03.53]
[03:09.04]Stay, stay where you are
[03:15.47]
[03:18.00]Where we are
[03:21.91]Is where we're suppose to be
[03:24.42]Where we are
[03:28.30]Keeps the breath in me
[03:30.79]Where we've been
[03:34.68]We've risen from the deep
[03:37.21]Where we're now no one can tear us apart
[03:42.72]That's where we are
[03:47.04]
[03:49.30]That's where we are
[03:53.99]
