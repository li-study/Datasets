[00:00]Save The Best For Last
[00:07]Vanessa Williams
[02:55][00:14]Sometimes the snow comes down in June
[03:01][00:20]Sometimes the sun goes around the moon
[00:25]I see the passion in your eyes
[00:30]Sometimes it's all a big surprise
[00:35]Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
[00:41]You'd tell me this was love
[00:45]It's not the way I hoped or how I planed
[00:51]Somehow it's enough
[00:55]And now we are standing face to face
[01:00]Isn't this world a crazy place
[03:06][01:05]Just when I thought that chance had passed
[03:09][01:10]You go and save the best for last
[01:22]All of the nights you came to me
[01:27]When some silly girl had set you free
[01:32]You wonder how you make it through
[01:37]I wonder what was wrong with you
[01:42]Cause how could you give your love to some one else
[01:48]And share your dreams with me
[01:52]Sometimes the very thing you are looking for
[01:59]Is the one thing you can't see
[02:03]But now we are standing face to face
[02:08]Here isn't the world a crazy palce
[02:13]Just when I thought that chance had passed
[02:17]You go and save the best for last
[02:42]Sometimes the very thing you are looking for
[02:49]Is the one thing you can't see
[03:20]You went and save the best for last
