[00:15.34]For you, there'll be no more crying,
[00:25.86]For you, the sun will be shining,
[00:36.16]And I feel that when I'm with you,
[00:41.45]It's alright, I know it's right
[00:57.81]
[00:58.12]To you, I'll give the world
[01:07.87]To you, I'll never be cold
[01:17.56]'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,
[01:22.94]It's alright, I know it's right.
[01:33.68]
[01:33.98]And the songbirds are singing,
[01:38.24]Like they know the score,
[01:43.66]And I love you, I love you, I love you,
[01:48.38]Like never before.
[02:00.50]
[02:15.26]And I wish you all the love in the world,
[02:25.15]But most of all, I wish it from myself.
[02:35.54]
[02:35.79]And the songbirds keep singing,
[02:40.56]Like they know the score,
[02:46.46]And I love you, I love you, I love you,
[02:51.90]Like never before, like never before.
