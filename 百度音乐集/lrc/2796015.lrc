[00:16.90]We walked to the sea, just my father and me
[00:24.73]And the dogs played around on the sand.
[00:33.26]Winter cold cut the air, hanging still everywhere
[00:41.32]Dressed in gray did he say hold my hand?
[00:51.58]I said love?s easier when it?s far away
[00:59.68]We sat and watched the distant lights.
[01:06.40]We?re two ships that pass in the night
[01:14.46]And we smile when we say it?s alright.
[01:22.91]We?re still here, it?s just that we?re out of sight
[01:30.85]Like those ships that pass in the night.
[01:55.29]There?s a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky.
[02:03.09]There?s another that rides far behind.
[02:11.23]And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide
[02:18.97]Ways apart as we drift on through time.
[02:28.94]He said it?s harder now you?re far away
[02:36.49]We only read you when you write.
[02:43.34]We?re two ships that pass in the night
[02:51.44]We both smile when we say it?s alright.
[02:59.31]We?re still here, oh it?s just that we?re out of sight
[03:07.29]Like those ships that pass in the night.
[03:17.50]We?re two ships that pass in the night
