[01:15.08][01:03.03][00:19.41][00:07.41]Hallelujah, hallelujah,
[03:41.28][01:10.33][00:14.77]God bless the child who suffers
[00:28.92]God bless the young without mothers
[03:40.74][03:32.48][02:51.25][02:31.63][02:23.81][02:17.50][01:56.44][01:43.35][01:29.05][01:01.71][00:48.55][00:34.11]
[00:35.42]This child is homeless,
[00:38.85]That child's on crack
[00:42.29]One plays with a gun,
[00:43.66]While the other takes a bullet in his back
[00:49.28]This boy's a beggar,
[00:52.70]That girl sells her soul
[00:56.20]They both work the same street,
[00:59.20]The same hell hole
[01:24.02]Let every man help his brother
[01:30.56]Some are born addicted and some are just thrown away
[01:37.39]Some have daddies who make them play games they don't want to play
[02:38.75][01:43.39]But with hope and faith
[01:47.59]We must understand
[02:45.20][01:51.03]All God's children need is love
[02:48.21][01:54.18]And us to hold their little hands
[02:11.48]This boy is hungry, he ain't got enought to eat
[02:18.26]That girl's cold and she ain't got no shoes on her feet
[02:24.96]When a child's spirit's broken
[02:28.35]And feels all hope is gone
[02:31.72]God help them find the strength to carry on
[02:41.87]Yea, we can understand
[03:33.54][03:20.07][03:06.70]Hallelujah, hallelujah
[03:13.80]Let us all love one another
[03:27.26]Make all our hearts bilnd to color
[03:48.14]
[03:48.15]The End
