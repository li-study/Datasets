[00:08.73]I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
[00:13.01]I feel so far away from where I've been
[00:17.30]I got my eggs, and my pancakes too
[00:21.06]Got my maple syrup, everything but you
[00:25.73]I break the yolks and make a smiley face
[00:29.57]I kinda like it in my brand new place
[00:32.78]I wipe the spots off of the mirror, dont leave the keys in the door
[00:37.40]I never put wet towels on the floor anymore cause
[00:42.17]Dreams last so long, even after youre gone
[00:50.56]I know, you love me and soon you will see
[00:57.78]You were meant for me and I was meant for you
[01:07.26]I called my momma, she was out for a walk
[01:10.66]Consoled a cup of coffee but it didnt wanna talk
[01:14.45]So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
[01:19.17]More hearts being broken or people being used
[01:23.71]Put on my coat in the pouring rain
[01:27.98]I saw a movie it just wasnt the same
[01:31.27]cause it was happy or I was sad and
[01:36.22]It made me miss you oh so bad cause
[01:40.46]Dreams last so long, even after youre gone
[01:48.98]I know, you love me and soon you will see
[01:55.99]You were meant for me and I was meant for you
[02:05.04]I go about my business, Im doing fine
[02:08.70]Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
[02:13.80]Same old story, not much to say
[02:18.20]Hearts are broken every day
[02:31.19]I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
[02:35.88]I know you hate it when I leave the light on
[02:39.00]I pick up a book and turn the sheets down and then
[02:43.92]Take a deep breath and a good look around
[02:48.02]Put on my pjs and hop into bed
[02:52.41]Im half alive but I feel mostly dead
[02:55.53]I try and tell myself itll be all right
[02:59.98]I just shouldnt think anymore tonight cause
[03:04.79]Dreams last so long, even after youre gone
[03:13.26]I know, you love me and soon you will see
[03:20.15]You were meant for me and I was meant for you
[03:28.40]Yeah, you were meant for me and I was meant for you
