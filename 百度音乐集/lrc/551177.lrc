[00:11.04]Daddy always said
[00:13.49]These are the 88 keys to pain
[00:19.98]And daddy always said
[00:22.53]Rinse down the hurt before it stains
[00:29.10]But daddy never said that after this not much remains
[00:38.26]If only he told her to play her life instead of shame
[00:47.28]When the lights go down
[00:49.67]And the world's asleep
