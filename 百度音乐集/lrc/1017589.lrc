[00:00.00]3 Doors Down - Running Out Of Days
[00:12.55]
[00:14.55]There's too much work and I'm spent
[00:20.59]There's too much pressure and I admit
[00:26.57]I got no time to move ahead
[00:32.47]Have you heard one thing that I've said
[00:36.30]
[00:38.63]And all these little things in life
[00:42.02]they all create this haze
[00:50.20]There's too many things to get done,
[00:53.92]and I'm running out of days
[00:57.37]
[01:08.68]And I can't last here for so long
[01:14.56]I feel this current it's so strong
[01:20.48]It gets me further down the line
[01:26.40]It gets me closer to the line
[01:32.04]
[01:32.57]And all these little things in life
[01:35.94]they all create this haze
[01:44.16]There's too many things to get done,
[01:47.84]and I'm running out of days
[01:52.34]
[02:17.70]All these little things in life
[02:21.11]they all create this haze
[02:29.25]There's too many things to get done,
[02:33.13]and I'm running out of days
[02:36.11]
[02:41.63]Will all these little things in life
[02:44.99]they all create this haze
[02:53.60]And now I'm running out of time
[02:57.09]I can't see through this haze
[03:00.25]My friend tell me why it has to be this way
[03:11.28]There's too many things to get done,
[03:15.10]and I'm running out of days
[03:18.50]
