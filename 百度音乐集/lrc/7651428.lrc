[00:17.83]Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
[00:22.34]Flowing into the night
[00:26.99]People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
[00:31.20]Taxi light shines so bright
[00:35.95]But I don’t need no friends
[00:44.78]As long as I gaze on waterloo sunset
[00:48.99]I am in paradise
[00:52.19]
[00:55.34]Every day I look at the world from my window
[01:04.00]But chilly, chilly is the evening time
[01:08.05]Waterloo sunset’s fine
[01:11.58]
[01:15.91]Terry meets julie, waterloo station
[01:20.18]Every friday night
[01:24.74]But I am so lazy, don’t want to wander
[01:29.61]I stay at home at night
[01:33.94]But I don’t feel afraid
[01:42.57]As long as I gaze on waterloo sunset
[01:46.94]I am in paradise
[01:51.88]
[01:53.50]Every day I look at the world from my window
[02:01.84]But chilly, chilly is the evening time
[02:06.76]Waterloo sunset’s fine
[02:09.08]
[02:14.07]Millions of people swarming like flies ’round waterloo underground
[02:22.82]But terry and julie cross over the river
[02:27.36]Where they feel safe and sound
[02:32.18]And they don’t need no friends
[02:40.76]As long as they gaze on waterloo sunset
[02:45.23]They are in paradise
[02:48.24]
[03:02.92]Waterloo sunset’s fine
