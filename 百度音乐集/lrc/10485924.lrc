[00:08.35]I'm not in love with the modern world
[00:08.88]I'm not in love with the modern world
[00:15.60]I was a torch driving the savages back to the trees
[00:24.23]Modern world has more ways
[00:32.70]And I don't mention it since it's changed
[00:33.05]While the people go out and the people come home again
[00:51.89]It's gotta last to build up your eyes
[00:55.88]And a lifetime of red skies
[00:59.77]And from my bed saying your haunted hissing in my bed
[01:08.11]Modern world don't ask why
[01:12.04]Cause modern world build things high
[01:17.76]Now they house canyons filled with life
[01:40.95]Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you
[01:44.66]You just bring me down
[01:50.23]Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you
[01:50.25]You just bring me down
[01:56.90]Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you
[02:06.38]You just bring me down
[02:06.99]Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you
[02:07.52]You just bring me down
