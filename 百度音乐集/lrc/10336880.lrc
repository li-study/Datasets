[00:02.00]Tina Turner - What's Love Got To Do With It
[00:07.00]
[00:19.73]You must understand how the touch of your hand
[00:24.53]Makes my pulse react
[00:28.91]That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
[00:34.72]Opposites attract
[00:36.73]It's physical
[00:40.61]Only logical
[00:45.83]You must try to ignore that it means more than that
[00:51.02]
[00:52.50]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[00:56.88]What's love but a second hand emotion?
[01:01.75]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[01:06.44]Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[01:11.23]
[01:11.93]It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
[01:15.91]When you're close to me
[01:20.76]If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
[01:25.61]I've got cause to be
[01:28.64]There's a name for it
[01:32.34]There's a phrase that fits
[01:37.55]But whatever the reason you do it for me
[01:43.14]
[01:44.01]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[01:48.37]What's love but a second hand emotion?
[01:53.23]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[01:57.96]Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[02:03.41]
[02:21.11]I've been takin' on a new direction
[02:26.14]But I have to say
[02:30.96]I've been thinkin' about my own protection
[02:35.48]It scares me to feel this way
[02:40.04]
[02:41.01]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[02:46.02]What's love but a second hand emotion?
[02:51.03]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[02:55.58]Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[03:00.31]
[03:01.72]Got to do, got to do with it
[03:04.72]What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion?
[03:09.42]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[03:13.83]Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[03:18.86]
[03:20.74]Huh, got to do with it
[03:27.69]What's love got to do, got to do with it?
[03:32.80]Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[03:37.37]What's love?
[03:39.52]Got to do it
[03:42.11]Got to do it
[03:45.43]What's love?
[03:47.26]
