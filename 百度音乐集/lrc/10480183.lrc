[00:08.48]<We'll be together>
[00:09.29]Ashley Tisdale
[00:10.11]
[00:13.53]I’m not alone
[00:16.48]Even when we’re apart
[00:19.39]I feel you in the air， yeah
[00:25.39]I’m not afraid
[00:28.49]I know what you’re thinking
[00:30.79]I can hear you everywhere
[00:37.45]Some people say it’ll never happen
[00:40.53]We’re just wasting time
[00:43.41]But good things come when you least expect them
[00:46.73]So I don’t really mind
[00:49.94]We’ll be together
[00:52.01]Come whatever
[00:53.68]I’m not just staring at the stars
[00:55.63]Just remember
[00:58.96]That no one else can tell us who we are
[01:02.12]We’ll be together
[01:04.39]So don’t ever stop listening to your heart
[01:09.28]’Cause I can’t turn mine off
[01:27.03]I can’t pretend
[01:29.82]This is a rehearsal for the real thing
[01:35.36]Because it’s not， and
[01:38.97]I know we’re young
[01:42.41]But I can’t help feeling what I’m feeling
[01:47.92]And I won’t stop
[01:51.20]Some things are meant to be and they’ll be there
[01:54.45]When the time is right
[01:57.55]Even though I know that...I swear
[01:59.77]I wish it was tonight
[02:03.76]We’ll be together
[02:05.75]Come whatever
[02:07.43]I’m not just staring at the stars
[02:10.35]Just remember
[02:12.43]That no one else can tell us who we are
[02:16.12]We’ll be together
[02:17.92]So don’t ever stop listening to your heart
[02:20.17]’Cause I can’t turn mine off
[02:28.80]We’ll be together
[02:30.89]Come whatever
[02:32.56]I’m not just staring at the stars
[02:35.59]Just remember
[02:37.58]That no one else can tell us who we are
[02:41.25]We’ll be together
[02:43.43]So don’t ever stop listening to your heart
[02:48.41]’Cause I can’t turn mine off
[03:18.22]I’m not alone
[03:21.19]Even when we’re apart
[03:25.23]I feel you in the air， yeah
