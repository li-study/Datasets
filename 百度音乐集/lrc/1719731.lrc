[01:24.02]Until you wake up
[01:24.87]You people need a shake up
[01:25.33]You take up so much time
[01:26.41]Worrying, Scurrying,
[01:29.36]Here, there,
[01:30.59]Losing your hear
[01:32.05]No money to spare
[01:33.61]No love to share
[01:35.39]No wonder you appear under pressure from here
[01:38.39]You look fresh, yeah
[01:39.97]But all I got is dirt in my hear
[01:40.92]My nightmares manifest,
[01:42.83]But I can escape
[01:45.25]Yours is in your chest
[01:47.79]With no formal shape
[01:50.24]The tape is running
[01:50.81]I push the button to send
[01:52.00]Upon each other we all depend

[01:56.19]Whoever asks my name
[01:57.03]Or where I came from
[01:57.86]People fear contamination
[02:00.48]If they chary too long
[02:02.35]I carry a strong
[02:03.79]Sin of despair
[02:05.54]It's in the air
[02:06.61]I'm broken and hard to repair
[02:07.44]I may mistaken be
[02:10.54]But I patiently wait
[02:12.10]On the pad to humanity
[02:13.61]I sit at the gates

[03:24.68]Dirty, Cold, Hurting, Soul,
[03:25.41]Down the river
[03:28.71]My liver in bad condition
[03:31.01]Like my skin
[03:32.20]Rain falling, once again
[03:34.06]I'm in my bed
[03:35.23]Hurt the time in
[03:36.69]I'm gonna struggle for air
[03:38.19]There's hair in my food
[03:40.29]When I get it usually someone already half ate it
[03:42.58]Touch it, not to let it
[03:43.48]Get me down
[03:47.38]But my head starting to pad
[03:47.71]People go round, and round and round
[03:52.11]
[03:52.36]From one I get a cigarette
[03:52.94]A little more love found
[03:55.00]But the ground is still wet
[03:55.55]My chief are chattering
[03:58.84]And there's a spattering of seeds
[03:59.09]Sometimes I lose all feeling in my feet
[04:00.00]When I sleep I'll do my deep in the mainstream
[04:00.53]But unaccountably my heart was growing
[04:02.36]Small and mean
[04:03.62]A hurry past
[04:04.46]Ridged people I pretend I haven't seen
[04:04.90]But there's money in my pocket
[04:05.50]And my clothes are clean?
