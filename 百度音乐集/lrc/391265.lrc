[00:28.30]When the time gets near for me to show my love
[00:34.11]The longer I stayed away for
[00:38.26]Hiding from a word I need to bear now
[00:43.00]Don't think I'll hear it again
[01:47.81][00:47.37]But the nights were always warm with you
[01:52.10][00:52.21]Holding you right by my side
[01:56.98][00:56.72]But the morning always comes too soon
[02:01.38][01:00.85]Before I even close my eyes
[03:21.37][03:02.62][02:06.93][01:06.02]All I do each night is pray
[03:25.92][03:07.15][02:11.79][01:11.25]Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
[03:30.49][03:11.85][02:16.19][01:16.02]All I do each night is think
[03:35.17][03:16.61][02:20.87][01:20.46]Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within
[03:39.21]... ... ... ...
[01:26.24]
[01:27.95]If you can't forgive the past
[01:31.38]I'll understand that
[01:33.83]Can't understand why I did this to you
[01:38.38]And all of the days and the nights so I'll regret it
[01:43.58]I never showed you my love
[02:25.40]Surely we must be in sight
[02:30.08]Of the dream we long to be live
[02:34.75]Of you stop and close your eyes
[02:37.34]You'll picture me inside
[02:40.05]I'm so cold and all alone
[02:44.15]
