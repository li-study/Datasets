[00:01.82]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:05.36]    C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:10.31]    Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
[00:12.53]    Get taps on your toes and get gone
[00:14.59]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:18.97]
[00:20.02]    Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
[00:22.13]    But he's got the dirtiest job in town
[00:24.26]    Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
[00:26.61]    On the windy corner of the dirty street
[00:28.86]    Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
[00:31.04]    How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
[00:33.44]    He grinned as he raised his little head
[00:35.28]    Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
[00:37.19]
[00:39.19]    Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:41.32]    C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:46.24]    Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
[00:48.48]    It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
[00:50.73]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[00:54.21]
[01:14.40]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[01:18.95]    C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
[01:22.92]    Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
[01:25.22]    Get taps on your toes and get gone
[01:27.40]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[01:32.66]
[01:33.03]    Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
[01:35.00]    And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
[01:37.51]    Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
[01:39.31]    He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
[01:41.45]    He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
[01:43.66]    I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
[01:45.56]    He said I like it with a big wide grin
[01:48.09]    Kept on a poppin' and he said again
[01:50.10]
[01:50.74]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
[01:55.81]    C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
[01:58.99]    It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
[02:01.21]    Does a million dollars worth of good for you
[02:03.34]    Get rhythm when you get the blues
