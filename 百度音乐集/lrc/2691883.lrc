[00:16.83]Can't get the stink off
[00:19.50]He's been hanging round for days
[00:25.31]Comes like a comet
[00:27.68]Suckered you but not your friends
[00:33.42]One day he'll get to you
[00:36.20]Teach you how to be a holy cow
[00:42.46]You do it to yourself
[00:45.07]You do
[00:46.32]And that's what really hurts
[00:48.56]Is you do it to yourself
[00:50.30]Just you
[00:51.79]You and no-one else
[00:59.54][00:54.17]You do it to yourself
[01:06.42]Don't get my sympathy
[01:09.09]Hanging out the 15th floor
[01:14.57]You've changed the locks 3 times
[01:17.26]He still comes reeling through the door
[01:22.89]One day I'll get to you
[01:25.32]Teach you how to get to purest hell
[02:35.18][01:31.60]You do it to yourself
[02:37.24][01:34.10]You do
[02:38.64][01:35.58]And that's what really hurts
[02:41.03][01:37.77]Is you do it yourself
[02:42.72][01:39.49]Just you
[02:44.23][01:41.27]You and no-one else
[02:51.27][02:46.44][01:48.70][01:43.30]You do it to yourself
