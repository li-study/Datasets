[00:00.00]Emmy the Great - City Song
[00:01.00]
[00:04.32]The city called me so I came
[00:08.11]It isn't mine to question what it said
[00:12.44]I sleep until the point when I'm awake
[00:16.75]I walk until there's nothing left to trek
[00:21.15]And everyone is looking for an answer
[00:25.47]And everyone is waiting for a break
[00:29.38]I came and I was bored of it soon after
[00:32.57]But I had nowhere to go and so I stayed
[00:40.57]I dreamed a lifetime of this place
[00:44.28]It seemed an awful thing to waste
[00:49.52]
[00:53.55]Well the morning fills my mouth up with decay
[00:58.57]I like it, it reminds me how you taste
[01:02.59]Sometimes I feel you rising up behind me like the wind
[01:06.99]But I still try to look away
[01:10.45]What will you look like when you're old?
[01:14.10](What will you look like when you're old?)
[01:15.95]What will I do if I don't know you?
[01:18.38](What will I do if I don't know you?)
[01:20.17]I guess that I decided not to ask the day I took the road
[01:26.56]Down to the city as it called
[01:30.48]Sun making silhouettes of gauze
[01:34.87]I don't remember you at all
[01:37.78]
[01:46.55]The city called me and I came
[01:52.35]It isn't mine to question why
[01:56.76]Sometimes the clouds will rise ahead, I hear your name
[02:00.82]It's like a choir in the sky
[02:04.70]What will you look like when you're old?
[02:08.23](What will you look like when you're old?)
[02:09.91]What will I do if I don't know you?
[02:11.56](What will I do if I don't know you?)
[02:13.82]I guess that I decided not to know the day I took the road
[02:19.24]Down to the city as it called
[02:23.54]Sun making silhouettes of gauze
[02:27.65]I don't remember you at all
[02:35.30]
[02:45.99]They pulled a human from my waist
[02:50.73]It had your mouth, it had your face
[02:54.66]I would have kept it if I'd stayed.
[03:03.68]
