[00:01.53]Long Live
[00:06.30]Taylor Swift
[00:11.30]
[00:17.25]I said remember this moment,
[00:21.96]In the back of my mind
[00:26.57]The time we stood with our shaking hands
[00:30.53]The crowds and stands went wild
[00:34.47]
[00:36.20]We were the Kings and the Queens
[00:41.00]And they read off our names
[00:45.45]The night you danced like you knew our lives
[00:49.29]Would never be the same
[00:53.23]
[00:55.01]You held your head like a hero
[00:59.69]On a history book page
[01:04.33]It was the end of a decade
[01:09.17]But the start of an age
[01:12.17]
[01:15.16]Long live the walls we crashed through
[01:18.98]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[01:23.32]I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[01:28.04]And bring on all the pretenders
[01:31.49]One day we will be remembered
[01:35.88]
[01:37.42]I said remember this feeling
[01:41.99]I passed the pictures around
[01:46.53]Of all the years that we stood there
[01:49.88]On the side-lines wishing for right now
[01:54.99]
[01:56.16]We are the Kings and the Queens
[01:59.83]You trade your basevall cap for a crown
[02:05.55]When they gave us our trophies
[02:09.04]And we help them up for our town
[02:15.00]And the cynics were outraged
[02:19.64]Screaming this is absurd
[02:24.28]Cause for a moment a band of theives
[02:28.06]In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[02:34.71]
[02:35.44]Long live the walls we crashed through
[02:38.94]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[02:43.39]I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[02:48.06]And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[02:53.00]
[02:54.06]Long live all the mountains we moved
[02:57.54]I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[03:02.40]I was screaming long live the look on your face
[03:07.09]And bring on all the pretenders
[03:10.30]One day we will be remembered
[03:14.72]
[03:18.19]Hold on to spinning around
[03:22.35]Confetti falls to the ground
[03:26.82]May these memories break our fall
[03:35.02]
[04:14.06]Will you take a moment?
[04:18.56]Promise me this
[04:22.60]That you'll stand by my forever
[04:26.26]But if God forbid fate should step in
[04:30.58]
[04:31.98]And force us into a goodbye
[04:36.73]If you have children some day
[04:41.77]When they point to the pictures
[04:46.25]Please tell them my name
[04:51.65]Tell them how the crowds went wild
[04:56.29]Tell them how our hope it shined
[05:00.55]
[05:01.69]Long live the walls we crashed through
[05:05.72]I had the time of my life with you
[05:10.60]Long, long live the walls we crashed through
[05:14.49]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[05:19.29]And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[05:23.82]And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[05:29.25]Saying long live all the mountains we moved
[05:32.08]I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[05:38.80]And long, long live, the look on your face
[05:42.57]And bring on all the pretenders
[05:46.03]One day 
[05:47.33]
[05:50.57]We will be remembered
[05:52.87]
