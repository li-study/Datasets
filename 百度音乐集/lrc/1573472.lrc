[00:30.00]Sappy pathetic little me
[00:36.00]That was the girl I used to be
[00:43.00]You had me on my knees
[00:52.00]I'd trade you places any day
[00:58.00]I'd never thought you could be that way
[01:04.00]But you looked like me on Sunday
[02:13.00][01:15.00]You came in with the breeze
[02:18.00][01:20.00]On Sunday morning
[02:20.00][01:23.00]You sure have changed since yesterday
[02:24.00][01:26.00]Without any warning
[02:27.00][01:29.00]I thought I knew you
[02:29.00][01:31.00]I thought I knew you
[02:33.00][01:34.00]I thought I knew you well...so well
[01:49.00]You're trying my shoes on for a change
[01:56.00]They look so good but fit so strange
[02:02.00]Out of fashion, so I can't complain
[02:47.00]I know who I am, but who are you?
[02:50.00]You're not looking like you used to
[02:53.00]You're on the other side of the mirror
[02:56.00]So nothing's looking quite as clear
[03:00.00]Thank you for turning on the lights
[03:03.00]Thank you, now you're the parasite
[03:06.00]I didn't think you had it in you
[03:09.00]And now you're looking like I used to!
[03:12.00]You came in with the breeze
[03:16.00]On Sunday morning
[03:18.00]You sure have changed since yesterday
[03:22.00]Without any warning
[03:25.00]And you want me badly
[03:28.00]You cannot have me
[03:31.00]I thought I knew you
[03:34.00]But I've got a new view
[03:37.00]I thought I knew you well...oh well
