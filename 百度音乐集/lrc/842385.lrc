[00:13.90]You'd think I would know
[00:16.96]All the answers to the questions before I get old
[00:26.42]But I've spent too much time thinking
[00:29.39]And I've spent too much time doing
[00:32.08]It's time to go
[02:56.56][02:32.02][01:44.78][00:41.43]And I need fun, fun, fun
[03:02.19][02:38.64][01:50.57][00:47.15]In my life, life, life
[03:08.48][02:44.41][01:56.50][00:53.12]And I need life, life, life
[03:14.25][02:50.34][02:02.42][00:59.38]In my fun, fun, fun

[01:23.64]And I saw something written on a car
[01:28.71]It said "The less you own the more freedom you have"
[01:33.17]The less you own the more freedom you have
[01:35.87]So I went home and I threw it all away
