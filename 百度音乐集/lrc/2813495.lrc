[00:18.26]I wake up every morning
[00:20.28]I stumble out of bed
[00:22.22]Stretching and yawning
[00:24.22]Another day ahead
[00:26.19]It seems to last forever
[00:28.19]And time goes slowly by
[00:30.15]'Till babe and me's together
[00:32.17]Then it starts to fly
[00:33.79]
[00:34.16]'Cause the moment that he's with me
[00:36.13]Time can take a flight
[00:38.11]The moment that he's with me
[00:40.04]Everything's all right
[00:42.27]Night-time is the right time
[00:44.19]We make love
[00:45.97]Then it's his and my time
[00:48.20]We take off
[00:51.44]
[00:52.83]My baby takes the morning train
[00:56.68]He works from nine 'til five and then
[01:00.65]He takes another home again
[01:04.57]To find me waiting for him
[01:08.00]
[01:08.70]My baby takes the morning train
[01:12.58]He works from nine 'til five and then
[01:16.49]He takes another home again
[01:20.57]To find me waiting for him
[01:24.04]
[01:24.44]He takes me to a movie
[01:25.99]Or to a restaurant
[01:28.05]To go slow dancing
[01:30.06]Anything I want
[01:32.16]Only when he's with me
[01:34.37]I catch a light
[01:35.99]Only when he gives me
[01:38.02]Makes me feel all right
[01:41.33]
[01:42.62]My baby takes the morning train
[01:46.55]He works from nine 'til five and then
[01:50.46]He takes another home again
[01:54.43]To find me waiting for him
[01:57.97]
[01:58.58]All day I think of him
[02:01.92]Dreaming of him constantly
[02:06.35]I'm crazy mad for him
[02:09.37]And he's crazy mad for me
[02:14.41]When he steps off the train
[02:17.85]I'm makin' a fool,a fight
[02:21.88]Work all day to earn his pay
[02:25.75]So we can play all night
[02:32.04]
[02:32.64]My baby takes the morning train
[02:36.28]He works from nine 'til five and then
[02:40.26]He takes another home again
[02:44.28]To find me waiting for him
[02:47.73]
[02:48.41]My baby takes the morning train
[02:52.32]He works from nine 'til five and then
[02:56.22]He takes another home again
[03:00.18]To find me waiting for him
[03:03.75]
[03:04.26]My baby takes the morning train
[03:08.18]He works from nine 'til five and then
