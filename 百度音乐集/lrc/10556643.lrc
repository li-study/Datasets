[00:00.00]Avril Lavigne - Unwanted
[00:11.00]
[00:22.66]All that I did was walk over
[00:27.86]Start off by shaking your hands
[00:30.96]That's how it wents
[00:35.48]I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight
[00:40.55]
[00:49.19]Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:55.74][00:53.37]I wanted to know you
[01:57.67][00:55.45]I wanted to show you
[03:05.20][02:46.81][02:00.28][00:58.32]You don't know me
[03:05.99][02:48.11][02:01.23][00:59.13]Don't ignore me
[03:06.96][02:49.29][02:02.50][01:00.28]You don't want me there
[03:08.38][02:50.66][02:03.82][01:01.62]You just shut me out
[03:13.85][02:56.07][02:09.09][01:06.77]You don't know me
[03:14.72][02:57.00][02:10.10][01:08.06]Don't ignore me
[03:15.87][02:58.20][02:11.30][01:09.19]If you had your way
[03:17.21][02:59.59][02:12.45][01:10.53]You'd just shut me up
[03:33.59][03:24.49][03:19.66][03:02.37][02:20.02][02:15.43][01:13.41]Make me go away
[01:18.56]
[01:33.59]No, I just don't understand why
[01:39.80]You won't talk to me
[01:42.12]It hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
[01:48.58]Don't talk words against me
[02:25.09][01:52.27]
[02:27.51]I tried to belong
[02:24.57]It didn't seem wrong
[02:30.11]My headaches
[02:35.65]It's been so long
[02:37.17]I'll write this song
[02:38.92]If that's what it take
[03:38.26]
