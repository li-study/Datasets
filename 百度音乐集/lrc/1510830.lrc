[00:06.00]My love, there's only in my life,
[00:15.00]the only thing that's right.
[00:21.00]My first love,
[00:25.00]you're every breath that I take, that I take.
[00:30.00]You're every step I make.
[00:37.00]And I, I want to share all my love with you,
[00:51.00]no one else will do.
[00:56.00]And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes),
[01:01.00]there tell me how much you care.
[01:07.00]Oh yes, you will always be my endless love.
[01:28.00]Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one,
[01:37.00]our lives have just begun.
[01:44.00]Forever, I'll hold you close in my arms.
[01:53.00]I can't resist your charms.
[01:59.00]And love (oh love),
[02:03.00]I'll be a fool for you.
[02:09.00]I'm sure you know I don't mind (oh you know I don't mind)
[02:19.00]Cause you, you mean the world to me.
[02:29.00]Oh I know (I know)
[02:33.00]I've found (I've found) in you my endless love.
[02:52.00]Oh...
[03:09.00]Oh and love (oh love), I'll be that fool for you.
[03:20.00]I'm sure
[03:25.00]you know I don't mind (oh you know I don't mind) Oh I don't mind
[03:31.00]And yes, you'll be the only one.
[03:41.00]Cause no one can deny this love I have inside.
[03:51.00]And I'll give it all to you
[03:57.00]my love (my love, my love) my endless love.
