[00:03.56]Love Should
[00:08.54]Moby
[00:13.64]
[00:24.38]So we in sleep in bed
[00:26.88]We never make
[00:29.45]Holding close to love
[00:32.08]Love should fade
[00:34.27]Holding on to this
[00:35.91]Is the best thing we'll ever do
[00:43.36]Morning sun is sweet and soft on your eyes
[00:48.25]Oh my love, you always leave me surprised
[00:52.96]Before my heart starts to burst
[00:56.03]With all my love for you
[02:37.61][02:18.79][01:22.50][01:03.75]I know how it rains
[02:42.30][02:23.51][01:27.18][01:08.33]I know how it
[02:45.46][02:26.77][01:30.66][01:10.65]I never could feel this way
[02:49.42][02:30.56][01:34.33][01:15.42]For anyone but you
[02:54.21]
[01:39.62]So it takes some time
[01:42.26]And slip away
[01:44.50]Holding on to love
[01:47.14]Love should stay
[01:49.20]Holding on to you
[01:51.33]Is the best thing I'll ever do
[01:58.40]Evening sun is sweet and soft in your face
[02:03.34]I never ever leave this place
[02:07.65]I feel my heart starts to burst
[02:11.21]With all my love for you
