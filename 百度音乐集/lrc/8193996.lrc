[00:00.00]One for My Baby
[00:00.01]Robbie Williams
[00:00.02]
[00:14.24]It's quarter to three
[00:17.89]there's no one in the place
[00:21.27]Except you and me
[00:28.29]So set 'em up Joe
[00:32.07]I got a little story
[00:35.64]I think you should know
[00:38.40]
[00:42.81]We're drinking my friend
[00:46.65]to the end
[00:48.92]Of a brief episode
[00:54.25]
[00:56.49]Make it one for my baby
[01:02.23]And one more for the road
[01:05.94]
[01:12.47]I got the routine
[01:15.93]put another nickel
[01:19.79]In the machine
[01:27.33]Feelin' so bad
[01:31.03]won't you make the music
[01:34.10]Easy and sad
[01:39.66]
[01:41.94]I could tell you a lot
[01:46.33]but it's not
[01:48.40]In a gentleman's code
[01:54.30]
[01:54.95]Just make it one for my baby
[02:01.53]And one more for the road
[02:04.98]
[02:11.64]You'd never know it
[02:14.06]but buddy I'm a kind of poet
[02:17.49]And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
[02:22.85]
[02:25.69]And when I'm gloomy
[02:29.63]won't you listen to me
[02:33.93]Till it's talked away
[02:42.93]Well that's how it goes,
[02:48.12]and Joe I know your gettin
[02:51.70]Anxious to close
[02:56.09]
[02:59.02]And thanks for the cheer
[03:02.96]I hope you didn't mind
[03:05.81]My bending your ear
[03:13.04]
[03:13.81]But this torch that I found
[03:17.63]it's gotta be drowned
[03:20.35]Or it's soon might explode
[03:26.38]
[03:27.57]Make it one for my baby
[03:33.62]And one more for the road
[03:37.64]
[03:39.44]The long
[03:42.93]It's so long
[03:47.15]The long
[03:57.32]And winding road
[04:00.78]
