[00:19.19]There’s talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
[00:27.98]Great expectations, everybody’s watching you
[00:37.24]People you meet, they all seem to know you
[00:45.92]Even your old friends treat you like you’re something new
[00:55.05]Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
[01:03.79]Everybody loves you, so don’t let them down
[01:12.64]You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
[01:22.07]Hopeless romantics, here we go again
[01:30.91]But after awhile, you’re lookin’ the other way
[01:38.53]It’s those restless hearts that never mend
[01:49.18]Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
[01:58.20]Will she still love you when you’re not around?
[02:08.97]
[02:24.34]There’s so many things you should have told her,
[02:33.15]but night after night you’re willing to hold her,
[02:38.69]Just hold her, tears on your shoulder
[02:46.34]There’s talk on the street, it’s there to remind you
[02:55.19]that it doesn’t really matter
[02:57.91]which side you’re on.
[03:04.10]You’re walking away and they’re talking behind you
[03:11.23]They will never forget you ’til somebody new comes along
[03:21.94]Where you been lately? There’s a new kid in town
[03:30.83]Everybody loves him, don’t they?
[03:35.33]Now he’s holding her, and you’re still around
[03:42.05]Oh, my, my
[03:44.97]There’s a new kid in town
[03:54.45]Just another new kid in town
[04:04.65]Ooh, hoo
[04:06.78]Everybody’s talking ’bout the new kid in town
[04:13.62]Ooh, hoo
[04:15.55]Everybody’s walking’ like the new kid in town
[04:21.55]There’s a new kid in town
[04:26.05]There’s a new kid in town
[04:28.72][04:24.27]I don’t want to hear it
[04:39.25][04:34.67][04:30.61]There’s a new kid in town
[04:43.43]There’s a new kid in town
[04:47.66]There’s a new kid in town
[04:51.98]There’s a new kid in town
