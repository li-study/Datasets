[00:08.22]Title: Spinning The Wheel
[00:29.06]Spin the wheel
[01:04.04]Five o'clock in the morning
[01:06.57]You ain't home
[01:08.76]I can't help thinking that's strange
[01:15.94]Baby I just want you to know
[01:21.63]I won't go through it again
[01:27.83]Yes, those clouds are closing in
[01:32.38]And I will not accept this as a part of my life
[01:38.08]I will not live in fear
[01:41.15]Of what may be
[01:46.14]And the lessons I have learned ...
[01:47.97]I would rather be alone than watch you
[01:51.73]Spinning that wheel for me
[01:55.94]You've got a thing about danger
[01:57.95]Ain't you getting what you want from me
[02:01.88]You've got a thing about strangers
[02:04.32]Baby that's what we used to be
[02:07.82]You've got a thing about danger baby
[02:10.72]I guess the hungry just can't see
[02:17.53]One of these days
[02:18.95]You're gonna bring some home to me
[02:46.33]Six o'clock in the morning you ain't home
[02:51.15]I can't help thinking that's strange
[02:59.36]It seems that everybody takes their chances
[03:02.87]These days
[03:07.51]Oh yeah, we're standing in the rain
[03:14.86]And I will not accept this as a part of my life ...
[04:06.48]How can you love me
[04:09.90]When you are playing with my life
[04:14.71]You say give me time and I'll do better I swea
[04:21.96]Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair
[04:34.64]And I don't want to go back there
