[01:17.32]Sits in his basement from midnight 'til four
[01:20.12]Painting pictures that nobody sees from his days in the war
[01:25.07]The canvas is painted bright red, red
[01:29.55]He heats up the shower, he paces the hall
[01:32.63]He'll scrub for an hour or more but he won't get it all
[01:37.44]The paint in his fingernail beds
[01:41.56]

[02:57.82]But it's just so
[02:59.68]High
[03:00.92]And I'm so
