[00:00.00]Vanessa Carlton - White Houses
[00:00.12]Album: Harmonium
[00:01.22][00:01.79][03:38.96][03:41.05]
[00:02.50]Crashed on the floor when I moved in
[00:05.91]This little bungalow with some strange new friends
[00:09.36]Stay up too late, and I'm too thin
[00:12.97]We promise each other it's til the end
[00:16.48]Now we're spinning empty bottles
[00:18.33]It's the five of us
[00:20.11]With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust
[00:23.69]I can't resist the day
[00:27.01]No, I can't resist the day
[00:30.84]Jenny screams out and it's no pose
[00:34.39]'Cause when she dances she goes and goes
[00:37.87]Beer through the nose on an inside joke
[00:41.38]I'm so excited, I haven't spoken
[00:45.01]And she's so pretty, and she's so sure
[00:48.19]Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her
[00:51.95]The summer's all in bloom
[00:55.51]The summer is ending soon
[00:58.62]It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone
[01:03.82][01:44.48]But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
[01:11.55]Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
[01:15.02]I come undone at the things he said
[01:18.51]And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
[01:21.83]We were all in love and we all got hurt
[01:25.66]I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat
[01:29.13]The smell of gasoline in the summer heat
[01:32.23]Boy, we're going way too fast
[01:36.13]It's all too sweet to last
[01:39.31]It's alright
[01:41.04]And I put myself in his hands
[01:50.52]Love, or something ignites in my veins
[01:55.15]And I pray it never fades in white houses
[02:01.91]My first time, hard to explain
[02:09.04]Rush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain
[02:15.98]On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think
[02:23.04]He's my first mistake
[02:45.37]Maybe you were all faster than me
[02:48.77]Give each other up so easily
[02:52.10]These silly little wounds will never mend
[02:55.60]I feel so far from where I've been
[02:58.76]So I go, and I will not be back here again
[03:04.25]I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses
[03:09.94]I lie, put my injuries all in the dust
[03:14.67]In my heart is the five of us
[03:18.48][03:28.99][03:32.20]In white houses
[03:20.60]And you, maybe you'll remember me
[03:25.38]What I gave is yours to keep
[03:35.79]In white houses
