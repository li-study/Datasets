[00:38.22]You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
[00:44.94]They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
[00:48.31]They tell me your passion's gone away
[00:51.74]And I don't need no carryin' on
[00:58.50]You stand in the line just to hit a new low
[01:05.11]You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
[01:11.94]You tell me your life's been way off line
[01:15.37]You're falling to pieces everytime
[01:18.79]And I don't need no carryin' on
[01:23.95]Cause you had a bad day
[01:25.63]You're taking one down
[01:27.28]You sing a sad song just to turn it around
[01:30.47]You say you don't know
[01:32.21]You tell me don't lie
[01:33.96]You work at a smile and you go for a ride
[01:37.14]You had a bad day
[01:39.06]The camera don't lie
[01:40.82]You're coming back down and you really don't mind

[01:46.01]yeahh
[02:02.73]Well you need a blue sky holiday
[02:06.20]The point is they laugh at what you say
[02:09.49]And I don't need no carryin' on
[02:14.51]You had a bad day

[02:42.73]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
[02:46.29]And the whole thing turns out wrong
[02:49.06]You might not make it back and you know
[02:52.03]That you could be well oh that strong
[02:55.06]And I'm not wrong
