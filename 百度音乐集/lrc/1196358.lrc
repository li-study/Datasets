[00:08.32]Title: Look After You
[00:09.41]
[00:13.25]If I don\'t say this now I will surely break
[00:18.94]As I\'m leaving the one I want to take
[00:24.74]Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
[00:30.81]My heart has started to separate
[00:36.86]
[00:37.37]Oh, oh,
[00:40.47]Be my baby
[00:43.27]Ohhhhh
[00:45.68]Oh, oh
[00:52.80]Be my baby
[00:56.11]I\'ll look after you
[01:00.08]
[01:08.86]There now, steady love, so few come and don\'t go
[01:14.65]Will you won\'t you, be the one I always know
[01:19.99]When I\'m losing my control, the city spins around
[01:25.81]You\'re the only one who knows, you slow it down
[01:31.87]
[01:32.89]Oh, oh
[01:35.83]Be my baby
[01:38.75]Ohhhhhh
[01:43.61]Oh, oh
[01:48.17]Be my Baby
[01:51.37]I\'ll look after you
[01:56.90]And I\'ll look after you
[02:02.97]
[02:12.19]If ever there was a doubt
[02:18.39]My love she leans into me
[02:24.12]This most assuredly counts
[02:29.67]She says most assuredly
[02:35.91]
[02:37.24]Oh, oh
[02:40.45]Be my baby
[03:05.27]Ohhhhhh
[02:56.00]Oh, oh
[03:01.85]be my baby
[02:43.34]I\'ll look after you
[02:54.50]
[03:10.93]It\'s always have and never hold
[03:14.36]You\'ve begun to feel like home
[03:23.56]What\'s mine is yours to leave or take
[03:26.11]What\'s mine is yours to make your own
[03:35.71]
[03:35.29]Oh, oh
[03:39.03]Be my baby
[04:19.02][03:55.15][03:42.08]Ohhhhh
[04:00.82][03:46.78]Oh, oh
[04:16.40][04:03.65][03:51.29]Be my baby
