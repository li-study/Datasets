[00:00.00]歌曲：Hungry Like The Wolf
[00:04.92]歌手：David Cook
[00:09.48]
[00:13.64]Dark in the city
[00:15.26]night is a wire
[00:17.16]Steam in the subway
[00:18.78]earth is a fire
[00:19.93]Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do
[00:27.91]Woman you want me
[00:29.45]give me a sign
[00:31.45]And catch my breathing even closer behind
[00:34.15]Do-do do do, do do do,
[00:36.31]do do do, do do do, do do
[00:39.59]
[00:42.33]In touch with the ground
[00:44.60]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
[00:48.17]Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
[00:51.54]And I'm hungry like the wolf
[00:55.44]Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
[00:58.75]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
[01:02.43]Mouth is alive with juices like wine
[01:05.73]And I'm hungry like the wolf
[01:10.51]
[01:14.16]Stalked in the forest
[01:15.65]too close to hide
[01:17.64]I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
[01:20.30]Do-do do do, do do do,
[01:22.08]do do do, do do do, do do
[01:28.38]High blood drumming on our skin it's so tight
[01:31.93]You feel my heat
[01:32.87]I'm just a moment behind
[01:34.69]Do-do do do, do do do,
[01:36.39]do do do, do do do, do do
[01:40.43]
[01:43.08]In touch with the ground
[01:45.04]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
[01:48.56]Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
[01:51.88]And I'm hungry like the wolf
[01:55.64]Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
[01:59.02]I howl and I whine I'm after you
[02:02.85]Mouth is alive all running inside
[02:06.17]And I'm hungry like the wolf
[02:12.70](Hungry like the wolf，Hungry like the wolf，Hungry like the wolf)
[02:17.12]Burning the ground I break from the crowd
[02:20.63]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
[02:24.04]I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found
[02:27.50]And I'm hungry like the wolf
[02:31.28]Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
[02:34.81]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
[02:38.40]Mouth is alive with juices like wine
[02:41.75]And I'm hungry like the wolf
