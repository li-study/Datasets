[00:07.96]
[00:13.64]<I. Reflection>
[02:55.96]
[03:04.66]Cunning, Baffling, Powerful
[03:06.75]Been beaten to a pulp
[03:09.06]Vigorous, Irresistable
[03:11.21]Sick and tired and laid low
[03:13.18]Dominating, Invincible
[03:15.72]Black-out, loss of control
[03:17.43]Overwhelming, Unquenchable
[03:19.51]I'm powerless, have to let go
[03:21.34]
[03:21.84]I can't escape it
[03:23.92]It leaves me frail and worn
[03:26.02]Can no longer take it
[03:28.12]Senses tattered and torn
[03:29.92]
[03:30.30]Hopeless surrender
[03:32.41]Obsession's got me beat
[03:34.49]Losing the will to live
[03:36.67]Admitting complete defeat
[03:38.41]
[03:57.61]Fatal Descent
[04:02.45]Spinning around
[04:06.82]I've gone too far
[04:12.35]To turn back round
[04:15.98]
[04:17.27]Desperate attempt
[04:22.19]Stop the progression
[04:27.15]At any length
[04:32.13]Lift this obsession
[04:36.12]
[04:37.42]Crawling to my glass prison
[04:39.98]A place where no one knows
[04:43.33]My secret lonely world begins
[04:47.08]
[04:49.58]So much safer here
[04:51.84]A place where I can go
[04:55.25]To forget about my daily sins
[04:59.72]
[05:00.14]Life here in my glass prison
[05:02.40]A place I once called home
[05:05.91]Fall in nocturnal bliss again
[05:09.68]
[05:12.01]Chasing a long lost friend
[05:14.30]I no longer can control
[05:17.60]Just waiting for this hopelessness to end
[05:21.95]
[06:14.43]<II. Restoration>
[06:14.99]
[06:16.48]Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
[06:20.01]A shattered glass prison wall behind me
[06:23.77]Fight - past walking through the ashes
[06:27.57]A distant oasis before me
[06:30.81]
[06:46.49]Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
[06:49.74]Begging God to please stop the insanity
[06:54.06]Help me - I'm trying to believe
[06:57.15]Stop wallowing in my own self pity
[07:00.71]
[07:01.60]"We've been waiting for you my friend
[07:04.68]The writing's been on the wall
[07:08.79]All it takes is a little faith
[07:12.03]You know you're the same as us all"
[07:14.79]
[07:16.58]Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
[07:27.44]Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
[07:38.70]Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone
[07:47.25]
[08:05.03]Enter the door
[08:05.85]Desperate
[08:06.79]Fighting no more
[08:07.75]Help me restore
[08:09.00]To my sanity
[08:10.17]At this temple of hope
[08:11.62]
[08:12.47]I need to learn
[08:13.34]Teach me how
[08:14.18]Sorrow to burn
[08:15.01]Help me return
[08:15.94]To humanity
[08:17.64]I'll be fearless and thorough
[08:19.17]To enter this temple of hope
[08:20.05]
[08:34.66]Believe
[08:35.62]Transcend the pain
[08:36.84]Living the life
[08:37.85]Humility
[08:39.17]Opened my eyes
[08:40.19]This new odyssey
[08:41.81]Of rigorous honesty
[08:43.19]
[08:43.46]Serenity
[08:44.36]I never knew
[08:45.21]Soundness of mind
[08:46.23]Helped me to find
[08:47.51]Courage to change
[08:48.70]All the things that I can
[08:50.46]
[08:51.89]"We'll help you perform this miracle
[08:55.19]But you must set your past free
[08:59.12]You dug the hole, but you can't bury your sole
[09:02.51]Open your mind and you'll see"
[09:04.97]
[09:06.00]Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
[09:17.72]Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
[09:28.83]Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone
[09:37.50]
[12:48.54]<III. Revelation>
[12:49.49]
[12:51.19]Way off in the distance I saw a door
[12:55.25]I tried to open
[12:58.59]I tried forcing with all of my will and still
[13:02.55]The door wouldn't open
[13:05.16]
[13:06.17]Unable to trust in my faith
[13:08.90]I turned and walked away
[13:13.41]I looked around, felt a chill in the air
[13:16.11]Took my will and turned it over
[13:19.98]
[13:20.81]The glass prison which once held me is now gone
[13:24.75]A long lost fortress
[13:28.17]Armed only with liberty
[13:31.26]And the key of my willingness
[13:34.84]
[13:35.49]Fell down on my knees and prayed
[13:40.17]"Thy will be done"
[13:42.93]I turned around, saw a light shining through
[13:46.46]The door was wide open
[13:50.13]
