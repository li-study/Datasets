[00:17.58]I don't see you like you don't call me back.
[00:27.37]But you kiss me when you're drunk.

[00:45.20]
[00:46.18]Don't you put your lips up to my mouth
[00:49.03]and tell me you can't stay.
[00:51.00]Don't slip your hand under my shirt
[00:53.30]and tell me it's okay.
[00:55.40]Don't say it doesn't matter
[00:57.32]cause it's gonna matter to me.
