[00:00.00]Will Young - Evergreen
[00:14.05]
[00:16.05]Eyes, like a sunrise
[00:22.62]Like a rainfall
[00:24.54]Down my soul
[00:29.89]And I wonder,
[00:32.74]I wonder why you look at me like that
[00:36.93]What you're thinking,
[00:38.77]What's behind
[00:42.23]Don't tell me but it feels like love
[00:49.47]
[03:21.03][02:52.41][02:01.44][00:50.09]I'm gonna take this moment
[03:25.12][02:56.09][02:05.07][00:53.68]And make it last forever
[03:28.21][02:59.56][02:08.52][00:57.23]I'm gonna give my heart away
[03:30.97][03:02.41][02:11.42][01:00.17]And pray we'll stay together
[03:35.19][03:06.64][02:15.62][01:04.31]'Cause you're the one good reason
[03:38.95][03:10.47][02:19.41][01:08.11]You're the only girl that I need
[03:42.76][03:14.28][02:23.25][01:11.96]'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen
[03:50.42][02:30.82][01:19.48]I'm gonna take this night
[04:00.17][03:52.60][02:32.99][01:21.70]And make it Evergreen
[04:05.61][03:57.50][02:36.87][01:25.86]
[01:27.22]Touch, like an angel
[01:33.91]Like velvet to my skin
[01:41.06]And I wonder,
[01:44.08]I wonder why you wanna stay the night
[01:48.18]What you're dreaming
[01:50.08]What's behind
[01:53.35]Don't tell me but it feels like love
[02:00.66]
[02:39.83](We can make it last forver more)
[02:43.89](Don't tell me, but it feels like love)
