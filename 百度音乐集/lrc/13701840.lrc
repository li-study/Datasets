[00:34.30]summer in the city, i'm so lonely lonely lonely
[00:40.67]so i went to a protest just to rub up against strangers
[00:47.65]and i did feel like coming but i also felt like crying

[00:59.10]
[01:01.43]and the castrated ones stand in the corner smoking
[01:07.70]they want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
[01:14.67]at the site of a beautiful woman they feel nothing but
[01:21.42]anger, her skin makes them sick in the night nauseaous, nauseaous, nauseaous

[01:34.79]i've been hallucinating you, babe, at the backs of other women
[01:41.94]and i tap on their shoulder and they turn around smiling
[01:48.43]but there's no recognition in their eyes
[01:54.23]
