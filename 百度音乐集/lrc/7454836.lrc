[00:00.00]sitting on the dock of the bay
[00:12.32]Sittin in the morning sun
[00:16.35]I`ll be sittin' when the evening comes
[00:23.14]Watching the ships roll in
[00:27.96]And I'll watch 'em roll away again
[00:34.11]I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
[00:38.62]Watching the time roll away
[00:44.62]Sittin' on the dock of the bay
[00:48.83]Wasting time.
[00:55.61]I left my home in Georgia
[01:00.79]And I headed for the Frisco bay
[01:06.64]I've got nothing to live for
[01:11.05]Look like nothings gonna come my way
[01:16.49]I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
[01:21.53]Watching the time roll away
[01:27.64]Sittin' on the dock of the bay Wasting time
[01:39.67]Look like nothings gonna change
[01:44.91]Everthing seems to stay the same
[01:50.21]I can't do what ten people tell me to do
[01:55.76]So I guess I'll just remain the same
[03:32.52]Sittin' here resting my bones
[03:41.37]Cause this loneliness won't leave me alone
[03:43.03]10000 miles from home
[03:44.00]Just to make this dock my home
[03:45.44]So I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
[03:46.96]Watching the time roll away, ooh
[03:48.03]Sittin on the dock of the bay Wastin' time
