[00:13.20]
[00:27.72]Cheers
[00:29.69]Thanks for everything
[00:32.02]You hung me out by my heart
[00:39.27]You're just so selfish jean
[00:42.50]Yes you are
[00:46.19]
[00:48.39]Hey you
[00:50.91]Threw it all away
[00:53.17]By holding everything in
[01:00.00]Hey Jean don't rock the boat
[01:03.42]When you can't swim
[01:06.61]
[01:09.26]With a perfect understanding
[01:11.84]of the finer things in life
[01:14.39]A quite alarming knack of knowing
[01:18.02]when to twist the knife
[01:20.16]Oooooooooh
[01:24.57]Selfish Jean
[01:27.02]
[01:29.58]Here's to you
[01:31.80]Who read everything
[01:35.32]Left it out on the shelf
[01:42.68]There's no one else to blame
[01:45.47]Except yourself
[01:49.62]
[01:51.05]Well a perfect combination
[01:53.46]of good etiquet and charm
[01:56.77]You keep the chocolate biscuits
[01:58.58]wired to a car alarm
[02:01.78]Oooooooooh
[02:06.60]Selfish Jean
[02:10.17]
[02:12.29]Well i'm standing on my own
[02:14.37]And this house is not a home
[02:16.92]It's so sad to see you go
[02:19.31]Things are high, things are low
[02:21.84]And it's good to know you know
[02:24.59]If you've got nowhere to go
[02:27.20]Well you could spend the night with me
[02:29.86]There will be no guarantee that I'll be here
[02:34.67]
[02:35.68]In the morning
[02:39.01]Or any time that you call
[02:46.04]I hear you snoring Jean
[02:47.89]Through the wall
[02:52.51]
[02:53.46]So hey
[02:57.95]Here's to everything
[03:01.09]To peace and love in our time
[03:08.08]Ah Jean the slate is clean
[03:10.54]I guess we're fine
[03:14.95]
[03:16.25]Well I don't expect a miracle
[03:18.98]Not asking you to change
[03:21.67]If you can see me happy
[03:22.72]Well just look the other way
[03:26.09]Oooooooooh
[03:31.18]Selfish Jean
[03:34.99]
[03:37.33]Heeeaaaaaah
[03:41.75]Selfish Jean
[03:44.56]
