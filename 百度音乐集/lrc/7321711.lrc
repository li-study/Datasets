[00:10.79]
[00:24.53]一天一天 重覆上演
[00:28.16]奔跑着却没有终点
[00:30.69]付出一切 拼凑一片
[00:33.97]我期待生活有所改变
[00:36.58]可笑的他们 冷漠的脸
[00:40.42]事不关己的语言
[00:42.70]我拼了命 奋力向前
[00:46.47]把明天都实现
[00:48.86]我祈祷我能遇见
[00:54.53]所谓完美的世界
[00:58.02]
[00:59.52]Is this all I've been waiting for
[01:05.78]Is this all I've been searching for
[01:11.55]我在追寻什么东西
[01:14.57]原来不过都只是空气
[01:17.09]So is this all I've been waiting for
[01:22.51]Waiting for waiting for
[01:24.50]
[01:30.85]半开的眼 半醒的眠
[01:33.87]思绪被困在梦里面
[01:36.71]我想看见 却看不见
[01:39.93]是否已经到了极限
[01:42.61]我祈祷我能遇见
[01:48.45]所谓完美的世界
[01:51.73]
[01:53.57]Is this all I've been waiting for
[01:59.45]Is this all I've been searching for
[02:05.52]我在追寻什么东西
[02:08.60]原来不过都只是空气
[02:11.14]So is this all I've been waiting for
[02:16.52]Waiting for waiting for
[02:18.54]
[02:47.55]Is this all I've been waiting for
[02:53.74]Is this all I've been searching for
[02:59.56]我在追寻什么东西
[03:02.62]原来不过都只是空气
[03:05.03]So is this all I've been waiting for
[03:10.49]Waiting for waiting for
[03:11.62]Is this all I've been waiting for
[03:17.71]Is this all I've been searching for
[03:23.53]我在追寻什么东西
[03:26.54]原来不过都只是空气
[03:28.98]So is this all I've been waiting for
[03:34.47]Waiting for , waiting for
[03:36.41]
