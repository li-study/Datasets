[00:02.00]B.B. King - Blues Before Sunrise
[00:04.00]
[00:08.86]I have the blues before sunrise
[00:15.77]With tears standin' in my eyes
[00:22.57]I have the blues before sunrise
[00:29.63]Tears standin' in my eyes
[00:35.69]It's such a miserable feelin'
[00:41.56]A feelin' I do despise
[00:45.87]
[00:49.51]Seems like everybody
[00:56.64]Everybody's down on me
[01:05.60]Seems like everybody
[01:11.62]Everybody's down on me
[01:18.50]I am gonna cast my problems
[01:23.57]Down in the deep blue sea
[01:27.50]
[02:08.57]Oh, today's been such a long lonesome day
[02:23.10]Today's been, day's been
[02:29.55]Such a long lonesome day
[02:36.54]I've been just sittin' here thinkin'
[02:41.56]With my mind a million miles away
[02:47.00]
[02:49.59]The blue starts rollin'
[02:56.58]And they stopped in the front of my door
[03:03.03]Blues are rollin'
[03:09.59]And they stopped at my front door
[03:15.93]I'm gonna change my way of livin'
[03:20.95]And I ain't gonna worry no more, no more
[03:28.29]
