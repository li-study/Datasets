[00:09.60]All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two,
[00:16.94]Had no intention to do the things we've done.
[00:27.73]Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
[00:35.16]But then we're two of a kind, we move as one.
[00:44.32]We're an all time high, we'll change all that's gone before.
[00:53.41]Doing so much more than falling in love.
[01:02.53]On an all time high, we'll take on the world and wait.
[01:11.67]So hold on tight, let the flight begin.
[01:22.53]I don't want to waste a waking moment, I don't want to sleep.
[01:29.96]I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you.
[01:40.75]In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
[01:48.18]My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true.
[01:57.22]We're an all time high, we'll change all that's gone before.
[02:06.55]Doing so much more than falling in love.
[02:15.49]On an all time high, we'll take on the world and wait.
[02:24.60]So hold on tight, let the flight begin.
[02:33.95]So hold on tight, let the flight begin.
[02:42.87]We're an all time high~
