[00:49.89]The big wheel keeps on turning
[00:54.40]On a simple line day by day
[00:59.58]The earth spins on its axis
[01:04.56]One man struggle while another relaxes
[01:08.28]
[01:09.20]There's a hole in my soul like a cavity
[01:13.56]Seems like the world is out to gather just by gravity
[01:19.36]The wheel keeps turning the sky's rearranging
[01:24.30]Look my son the weather is changing
[01:28.25]
[01:29.09]I'd like to feel that you could be free
[01:33.78]Look up at the blue skies beneath a new tree
[01:37.85]Sometime again
[01:39.41]You'll turn green and the sea turns red
[01:44.55]My son I said the power of axis over my head
[01:51.65]The big wheel keeps on turning
[01:56.35]On a simple line day by day
[02:01.51]The earth spins on its axis
[02:06.50]One man struggle while another relaxes
[02:10.40]
[02:11.33]We sang about the sun and danced among the trees
[02:15.88]And we listened to the whisper of the city on the breeze
[02:20.93]Will you cry in the most in a lead-free zone
[02:26.34]Down within the shadows where the factories drone
[02:31.09]On the surface of the wheel they build another town
[02:36.01]And so the green come tumbling down
[02:40.91]Yes close your eyes and hold me tight
[02:45.82]And i'll show you sunset sometime again
[02:51.00]The big wheel keeps on turning
[02:55.89]On a simple line day by day
[03:01.05]The earth spins on its axis
[03:05.98]One man struggle while another relaxes
[03:09.95]
[03:35.57]As a child's silent prayer my hope hides in disguise
[03:40.43]While satellites and cameras watch from the skies
[03:45.42]An acid drop of rain recycled from the sea
[03:50.41]It washed away my shadow burnt a hole in me
[03:55.40]And all the king's men cannot put it back again
[04:00.25]But the ghetto sun will nurture life
[04:05.27]And mend my soul sometime again
[04:17.04]
[04:57.52][04:37.59][04:17.87]The big wheel keeps on turning
[05:02.28][04:42.43][04:22.59]On a simple line day by day
[05:07.34][04:47.56][04:27.77]The earth spins on its axis
[05:12.50][04:52.62][04:32.81]One man struggle while another relaxes
[05:16.21][04:56.46][04:36.35]
