[00:00.57]Home
[00:06.28]Vanessa Carlton
[00:13.73]
[00:16.00]Some people live in a house on a hill
[00:23.72]And they wish they were someplace else
[00:31.52]There's nobody there when the evening is still
[00:39.44]Secrets with no one to tell
[00:45.51]
[00:47.07]And some I have known
[00:50.57]Have a ship where they sleep
[00:54.94]With sounds of rocks on the coast
[01:02.66]They sail over oceans five fathoms deep
[01:10.65]They can't find what they want the most
[01:17.84]
[01:18.36]And even now
[01:22.30]When I'm alone
[01:26.21]I've always known
[01:29.98]With you
[01:31.63]I am home
[01:32.90]
[01:33.97]And some live in towns
[01:37.27]Cardboard shack on concrete
[01:41.69]All blustered, and bustling life
[01:49.22]They search for the color
[01:53.05]You can never quite see
[01:56.79]Cause it's all white on white
[02:02.47]
[02:05.20]And even now
[02:09.06]When I'm alone
[02:12.94]I've always known
[02:16.79]With you
[02:18.36]I am home
[02:20.15]
[02:20.86]And even now
[02:24.94]When I'm alone
[02:28.68]I've always known
[02:32.39]With you
[02:33.96]I am home
[02:34.99]
[02:52.01]For me it's a glimpse
[02:55.80]And a smile on your face
[02:59.84]A touch of your hands
[03:03.70]An honest embrace
[03:06.57]
[03:07.65]For where I lay, it's you I keep
[03:11.78]This changing world
[03:13.40]And i fall asleep
[03:15.42]With you all I know is
[03:19.26]I'm coming home
[03:22.18]Coming home
