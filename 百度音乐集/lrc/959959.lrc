[00:21.83]I catch a paper boy
[00:24.39]But things don't really change
[00:26.87]I'm standing in the wind
[00:29.49]But I never wave bye-bye
[00:31.78]
[00:34.88]But I try
[00:38.21]I try
[00:39.84]
[00:45.21]There's no sign of life
[00:47.63]It's just the power to charm
[00:50.06]I'm standing in the rain
[00:52.69]But I never wave bye-bye
[00:55.02]
[02:15.58][00:58.21]But I try

[02:34.96][01:17.38]Church on Time terrifies me
[02:37.50][01:20.10]Church on Time makes me party
[02:40.06][01:22.66]Church on Time puts my trust in God and Man
[02:45.31][01:28.04]God and Man no confessions
[02:47.87][01:30.51]God and Man no religion
[02:50.34][01:33.01]God and Man don't believe in Modern Love
[02:55.07][01:38.07]
[02:02.78]It's not really work
[02:05.13]It's just the power to charm
[02:07.61]I'm standing in the rain
[02:10.26]But I never wave bye-bye
