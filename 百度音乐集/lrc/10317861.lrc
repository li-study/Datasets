[00:00.00]Tom Traubert’s Blues - Waltzing Matilda
[00:05.00]Tom Waits
[00:10.00]
[00:23.00]Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
[00:30.00]I've got what I paid for now
[00:37.20]See you tomorrow
[00:40.00]hey Frank, can I borrow
[00:43.78]a couple of bucks from you, to go
[00:51.92]Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[00:58.77]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[01:05.26]
[01:08.18]I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
[01:14.22]And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
[01:22.01]No one speaks English, and everything's broken
[01:28.19]and my Stacys are soaking wet
[01:33.74]To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[01:43.36]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[01:49.94]
[01:51.82]Now the dogs are barking
[01:56.06]And the taxi cab's parking
[01:59.85]A lot they can do for me
[02:06.61]I begged you to stab me
[02:10.04]You tore my shirt open
[02:13.28]And I'm down on my knees tonight
[02:20.13]Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
[02:26.91]In your silhouette window light
[02:33.11]To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[02:42.01]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[02:49.02]
[02:51.21]Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
[02:58.68]And the one-armed bandit knows
[03:05.48]And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs
[03:12.20]And the girls down by the strip-tease shows, to go
[03:21.20]Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[03:27.88]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[03:34.84]
[03:36.95]No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
[03:44.29]That the streets aren't for dreaming now
[03:51.80]And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
[03:57.98]They want a piece of the action anyhow go
[04:06.87]Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[04:13.67]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[04:20.25]
[04:22.80]And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor
[04:30.17]And the old men in wheelchairs know
[04:37.03]And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
[04:43.59]And she follows wherever you may go
[04:52.19]Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
[04:59.17]You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
[05:06.10]
[05:08.44]And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace
[05:16.60]And a wound that will never heal
[05:23.64]No prima donna, the perfume is on
[05:30.22]An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
[05:37.47]And goodnight to the street sweepers
[05:41.36]The night watchman flame keepers
[05:45.08]And goodnight to Matilda too
