[00:07.50]Somethings wrong 'cause my mind is fading
[00:11.50]And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
[00:15.50]Temperatures dropping at the rotten qasis
[00:18.50]Stealing kisses from the leperous faces
[00:30.50]Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees
[00:34.50]Mouthwash jukebox gasoline
[00:38.50]Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets
[00:42.50]Smiling eyes ripping out of his sockets
[00:49.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[00:53.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[00:57.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[01:01.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind.
[01:13.50]Love machines on the sympathy crutches
[01:17.50]Discount orgies on the dropout buses
[01:20.50]Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses
[01:25.50]Coming to town with the brief case blues
[01:32.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[01:36.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[01:40.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[01:44.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind.
[02:03.50]Somethings wrong 'cause my mind is fading
[02:07.50]Ghetto-blasting disintegrating
[02:11.50]Rock 'n' roll, know what I'm saying
[02:15.50]And everywhere I look there's a devil waiting
[02:26.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[02:30.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[02:34.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind,
[02:38.50]Got a devil's haircut in my mind.
