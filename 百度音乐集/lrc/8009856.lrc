[00:16.39]Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
[00:23.05]You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
[00:29.84]I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
[00:36.87]And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
[00:44.14]This is getting serious
[00:51.42]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[00:56.53]Don't say what you're about to say
[01:03.58]Look back before you leave my life
[01:10.57]Be sure before you close that door
[01:17.61]Before you roll those dice
[01:24.74]Baby think twice
[01:31.76]Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
[01:41.04]For the fire and the faith that was you and me
[01:47.97]Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
[01:55.61]'Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
[02:03.03]But baby this is serious
[02:10.10]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[02:15.12]Don't say what you're about to say
[02:22.07]Look back before you leave my life
[02:29.22]Be sure before you close that door
[02:36.26]Before you roll those dice
[02:43.33]Baby think twice
[02:59.95]Baby this is serious
[03:07.30]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[03:16.12]Don't say what you're about to say
[03:23.15]Look back before you leave my life
[03:30.09]Be sure before you close that door
[03:36.92]Before you roll those dice
[03:44.80]Don't do what you're about to do
[03:51.62]My everything depends on you
[03:58.41]And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
[04:05.32]Before you roll those dice
[04:12.68]Baby think twice
