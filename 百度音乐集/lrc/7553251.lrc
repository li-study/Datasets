[00:18.53]I think I’ll just fall to pieces
[00:24.41]If I don’t find something else to do
[00:30.69]This sadness never ceases
[00:36.77]Woman, I’m still in love with you
[00:40.58]
[00:42.55]My head, it keeps on reeling
[00:47.76]It’s got me in a crazy spin
[00:53.91]Oh, Darling, darling, darling, darling
[01:00.18]Is this the end?
[01:03.77]
[01:06.21]Still in love with you
[01:09.66]
[01:14.01]So people say time has a way of healing
[01:19.95]And it can dry all the tears from your eyes
[01:26.02]Oh but darling they don`t tell you
[01:29.12]About this empty feeling
[01:32.77]And I can not disguise it
[01:36.09]
[01:38.13]After all that we’ve been through
[01:43.78]I try my best but it’s no use
[01:49.60]I`ll always keep on loving you
[01:55.46]Is this the end?
[01:59.57]
[02:01.82]Still in love with you
[02:05.44]

[02:44.25]
[03:28.58]Now that it’s all over
[03:33.86]Woman, there’s something I think you should know
[03:39.38]Baby, baby, you might think it over
[03:45.60]Just one more time before you go
[03:50.46]
[03:51.60]Call on me baby
[03:56.75]If there’s anything I can do for you
[04:03.01]Call on me baby, baby
[04:09.30]Help me see it through
[04:13.23]
[04:16.51]I’m still in love with you
[04:21.82]
