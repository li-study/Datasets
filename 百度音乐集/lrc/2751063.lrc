[01:12.35][00:00.07]These lonely nights
[07:05.56][00:08.22]Turn to lonely days for me at home
[08:29.89][07:04.31][01:12.89][00:10.83]I don't wanna go there again
[08:01.01][00:47.00]I'm already overdrawn from loving you too long
[16:21.05][15:29.26][15:23.47][15:06.33][13:40.01][11:21.43][10:57.59][07:27.16][07:09.79][07:02.18][06:02.34][00:51.19]
[13:27.21][04:17.30][00:57.40]We're one, two of a kind
[01:23.59]When I'm away from you a part of me is empty
[02:41.06]Underneath the cover
[16:08.37][02:44.25]
[02:54.24]Hopes and dreams to free us
[03:31.88]to see us through
[16:29.15][03:48.64]'Cause I'd miss your everything
[11:21.44][03:56.57]I don't mind if I stay up all night
[04:36.74]So I say to you keep me rock steady
[14:39.40][04:57.62]I'd miss your everything
[08:01.89][05:21.23]We're two of a kind
[05:34.07]When I'm away from you a part of me is dying

[06:38.11]作詞：JACK BLADES
[06:50.75]So I say to you I'll keep on trying
[13:25.96][09:41.07][08:38.19][06:55.40]So don't turn out the light
[06:58.71]Tell me if you think I've got it right this time
[06:58.72]With miles and miles between us
[07:17.82]Or a love affair gone mad
[08:46.90]編曲：TAK MATSUMOTO / AKIHITO TOKUNAGA
[09:01.52]Cause I feel I'm going under
[11:19.04]Oh oh, listen baby
[11:23.56]作曲：TAK MATSUMOTO
[13:42.82][11:41.56]If you would only come and see me
[15:46.20][12:49.69]It all could be so easy
[13:56.69]But I hate to see you so sad
[15:44.26]
[16:46.33]All could be so easy
[17:08.23]I've got to see us through yeah yeah
