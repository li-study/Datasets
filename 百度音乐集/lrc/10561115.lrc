
[00:07.97]Lord I don't know which way I am going
[00:17.13]Which way river gonna flow
[00:24.67]It's just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
[00:33.37]Still got such a long way to go
[00:41.93]Still got such a long way to go
[00:49.80]
[00:49.99]Then that light, it's your eye
[00:58.58]I move, I swim,
[01:00.66]And found somewhere the streets are made of gold
[01:06.45]But it's fly, split the skies
[01:15.10]But that's all right, sometimes, sunlight I'm streaming to the holes
[01:23.23]
[01:23.46]Oooohhh ooohh
[01:57.55]
