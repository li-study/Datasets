[00:02.00]Tina Turner - Goldeneye
[00:45.00]
[00:46.94]ee reflections on the water
[00:52.62]More than darkness in the depths
[00:57.06]See him surface and never a shadow
[01:01.52]On the wind I feel his breath
[01:06.00]
[01:06.84]Golden eye, I found his weakness
[01:11.07]Golden eye, he'll do what I please
[01:15.94]Golden eye, no time for sweetness
[01:20.47]But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees
[01:24.80]
[01:25.60]You'll never know, how I watched you from the shadows as a child
[01:34.78]You'll never know, how it feels to be the one who's left behind
[01:44.92]You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried
[01:53.07]But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side
[02:03.85]
[02:06.51]See him move through smoke and mirrors
[02:12.15]Feel his presence in the crowd
[02:16.80]Other girls they gather around him
[02:21.58]If I had him I wouldn't let him out
[02:25.99]
[02:26.96]Golden eye, not lace or leather
[02:31.07]Golden chain, take him to the spot
[02:35.62]Golden eye, I'll show him forever
[02:40.27]It will take forever to see what I've got
[02:44.64]
[02:45.58]You'll never know, how I watched you from the shadows as a child
[02:55.76]You'll never know, how it feels to get so close and be denied
[03:04.99]It's a gold and honey trap, I've got for you tonight
[03:12.72]Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss, now I've got you in my sight
[03:24.59]
[03:25.58]With a golden eye
[03:31.02]Golden, golden eye
[03:35.79]With a golden eye
[03:40.36]Golden eye
[03:45.39]
