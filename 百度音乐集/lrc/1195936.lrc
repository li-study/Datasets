[00:19.57]Title: The Unforgettable Fire
[00:40.75]Ice
[00:42.75]Your only rivers run cold
[00:46.42]These city lights
[00:49.65]They shine as silver and gold
[00:53.56]Dug from the night
[00:56.91]Your eyes as black as coal
[01:03.70]
[01:11.92]Walk on by
[01:13.79]Walk on through
[01:15.98]Walk 'til you run
[01:18.30]And don't look back
[01:20.75]For here I am
[01:26.83]
[01:29.12]Carnival
[01:31.57]The wheels fly and the colors spin
[01:35.35]Through alcohol
[01:38.74]Red wine that punctures the skin
[01:42.72]Face to face
[01:45.83]In a dry and waterless place
[01:42.51]
[01:54.24]Walk on by
[01:55.71]Walk on through
[01:57.31]So sad to besiege your love so head on
[02:04.37]Stay this time
[02:07.89]Stay tonight in a lie
[02:11.64]I'm only asking but I...
[02:15.71]I think you know
[02:20.81]Come on take me away
[02:23.69]Come on take me away
[02:27.41]Come on take me home
[02:32.02]Home again
[02:37.36]
[03:21.31]And if the mountain should crumble
[03:24.77]Or disappear into the sea
[03:29.33]Not a tear, no not I
[03:33.16]
[03:33.61]Stay in this time
[03:37.13]Stay tonight in...
[03:40.60]Ever after, this love in time
[03:46.58]And if you save your love
[03:51.04]Save it all
[03:53.45]
[03:54.64]Don't push me too far
[03:57.86]Don't push me too far
[04:02.88]Tonight
[04:08.57]Tonight
[04:12.00]Tonight...
[04:45.97]End
