[00:00.00]Sophie Zelmani - Our Love
[00:04.26]
[00:09.20]To leave somebody like you made me crazy
[00:14.85]
[00:18.31]Sometimes you don't wanna know what hearts can do
[00:23.61]
[00:27.50]To leave you was the way to get happy
[00:32.80]
[00:36.09]To leave your love was what I had to do
[00:41.58]
[00:45.70]I know that some places some moments will throw light upon our faces
[00:51.47]
[00:54.60]But there will be no time I wish I had no scar
[00:59.90]
[01:03.75]And those little hands were holding together
[01:09.61]
[01:12.85]That's our love
[01:14.28]
[01:21.47]That's our love
[01:24.44]
[01:26.19]That's our love
[01:29.24]
[01:40.47]To save her from you was a thought too hard to imagine
[01:46.48]
[01:50.05]And I understand that some feelings really are gone
[01:55.57]
[01:59.05]But maybe you can feel it when we are hugging
[02:04.82]
[02:07.85]That is something he's left I wouldn't mind to stay strong
[02:14.39]
[02:17.18]And we've got a heart that won't ever leave us broken
[02:23.31]
[02:26.04]That's our love
[02:27.55]
[02:30.31]That's our heart
[02:32.54]
[02:34.63]That's our love
[02:36.90]
[02:39.53]That's our love
[02:41.75]
[02:52.94]That's our love
[02:55.25]
[02:57.78]That's our love
[03:00.00]
[03:07.65]The End
