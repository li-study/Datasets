[00:26.29]Mother doesn't know where love has gone
[00:33.04]She says it must be youth
[00:35.33]That keeps us feeeling strong
[00:40.11]See it in her face, that's turned to ice
[00:46.18]And when she smiles she shows
[00:48.45]The lines of sacrifice
[00:52.65]And now i know what they're saying
[00:56.34]When the sun begins to fade
[01:01.41]And we made our love on wasteland
[01:07.14]And through the barricades
[01:12.95]Father made my history
[01:18.03]He fought for what he thought
[01:22.08]Would set us somehow free
[01:25.60]He tought me what to say in school
[01:31.87]I learned off by heart
[01:34.68]But now that's torn in two
[01:38.63]And now i know what they're saying
[01:42.16]In the music of the parade
[01:45.78]We made our love on wasteland
[01:52.49]And through the barricades
[02:08.82]Born on different sides of life
[02:15.50]We feel the same
[02:17.17]And feel all of this strife
[02:22.03]So come to me when i'm asleep
[02:28.93]We'll cross the line
[02:30.99]And dance upon the street
[02:34.95]And now i know what they're saying
[02:38.28]When the drums begin to fade
[02:43.58]We made our love on wasteland
[02:48.88]And through the barricades
[02:55.12]Oh, turn around and i'll be there
[03:00.16]There's a scar through my heart
[03:02.03]But i'll bare it again
[03:06.36]I thought?we were the human race
[03:10.38]But we were just another border-line-case
[03:14.98]And the stars reach down and tell us
[03:17.82]That there's always one escape
[03:24.85]I don't know where love has gone
[03:30.54]And in this trouble land
[03:32.83]Desperation keep us strong
[03:37.23]Fridays child is full of soul
[03:43.56]With nothing left to lose
[03:46.54]There's everything to go
[03:50.37]And now i know what they're are saying
[03:54.98]It's a terrible beauty we've made
[03:58.75]So we make our love on?wasteland
[04:04.29]And through the barricades
[04:09.07]Now i know what they're are saying
[04:11.90]As hearts go to their graves
[04:17.11]We made our love on?wasteland
[04:25.06]And through the barricades.
