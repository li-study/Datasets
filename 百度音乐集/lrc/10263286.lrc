[00:10.99]Carpenters

[00:12.56]We've only just begun to live
[00:21.14]White lace and promises
[00:26.47]A kiss for luck and we're on our way
[00:31.90]We've only begun
[00:34.83]Before all the rising sun we fly,
[00:43.44]So many roads to choose
[00:49.07]We start our walking and learn to run.
[00:54.53]And yes! We've just begun.
[01:01.86]Sharing horizons that are new to us
[01:07.35]Watching the signs along the way
[01:12.58]Talking it over just the two of us
[01:18.07]Working together day to day
[01:23.09]Together.
[01:27.08]And when the evening comes we smile
[01:35.68]So much of life ahead
[01:41.14]We'll find a place where there's room to grow
[01:46.60]And yes! We've just begun.
