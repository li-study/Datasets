[00:21.14]The sky is red, i don't understand,
[00:23.33]Past midnight i still see the land.
[00:25.78]People are sayin' the woman is damned,
[00:28.14]She makes you burn with a wave of her hand.
[00:35.66]The city's a blaze, the town's on fire.
[00:38.20]The woman's flames are reaching higher.
[00:40.65]We were fools, we called her liar.
[00:43.14]All i hear is
[00:46.90]burn!
[01:04.62]I didn't believe she was devil's sperm.
[01:06.63]She said, curse you all, you'll never learn!
[01:09.26]When i leave there's no return.
[01:11.70]The people laughed till she said,
[01:13.89]burn!
[01:19.14]Warning came, no one cared.
[01:21.33]Earth was shakin', we stood and stared.
[01:23.87]When it came no one was spared.
[01:26.84]Still i hear
[01:29.90]burn!
[01:48.82]You know we had no time,
[01:53.48]We could not even try.
[01:58.41]You know we had no time.

[03:29.82]The sky is red, i don't understand,
[03:32.18]Past midnight i still see the land.
[03:34.72]People are sayin' the woman is damned,
[03:36.82]She makes you burn with a wave of her hand.
[03:44.17]Warning came, no one cared.
[03:46.27]Earth was shakin, we stood and stared.
[03:48.80]When it came no one was spared.
[03:51.26]Still i hear
[03:54.84]burn!
