[00:01.25]Good Is Good
[00:04.94]Sheryl Crow
[00:08.83]
[00:15.23]Good is good and bad is bad
[00:19.78]But you don't know which one you had
[00:28.70]She put your books out on the sidewalk
[00:33.80]Now they're blowin round
[00:37.48]But they don't help you when you're down
[00:42.17]Love's on your list of things to do
[00:45.83]
[00:48.10]To bring your good luck back to you
[00:55.56]If you think that everything's unfair
[01:00.87]Would you care if you're the last one standing there
[01:09.06]And every time you hear the rolling thunder
[01:15.10]You turn and run before the lightening strikes
[01:22.00]And does it ever make you stop and wonder
[01:29.33]If all your good times have passed you by
[01:32.28]
[01:39.27]I dont hold no mystery
[01:45.23]But I can show you how to turn the key
[01:49.86]Cause all I know is where I started
[01:56.83]I was so downhearted
[01:59.54]And that's not where you want to be
[02:06.30]And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
[02:10.70]You turn and run before the lightening strikes
[02:16.49]If you could find a rock to crawl right under
[02:24.01]and let your good times pass you by
[02:29.79]When the day is done and the world is sleeping
[02:34.95]And the moon is on its way to shine
[02:40.51]All your friends are gone
[02:45.28]You've got a soul worth keeping
[02:48.45]You feel you don't belong but you don't know why
[02:54.03]And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
[03:00.29]
[03:03.14]You turn and run before the lightening strikes
[03:08.24]And does it ever make you stop and wonder
[03:14.33]If all your good times have passed you by
[03:20.14]Everytime you hear the rolling thunder
[03:24.14]And you turn and run before the lightening strikes
[03:31.01]Does it ever make you stop and wonder
[03:36.88]
[03:40.33]If all your good times have passed you by
[03:43.46]When the day is done and the world is sleeping
[03:49.15]And the moon is on its way to shine
[03:55.76]All your friends are gone
[03:58.44]You've got a soul worth keeping
[04:02.04]You feel you don't belong but you don't know why
[04:06.93]
