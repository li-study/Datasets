[00:00.00]John Mayer - Daughters
[00:21.60]
[00:23.60]I know a girl
[00:27.67]She puts the color inside of my world
[00:34.91]She's just like a maze
[00:39.10]Where all of the walls all continually change
[00:45.18]
[00:46.36]I've done all I can
[00:50.58]To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
[00:57.74]Now I'm starting to see
[01:02.07]Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
[01:06.99]
[01:09.40]Fathers be good to your daughters
[01:15.24]Daughters will love like you do
[01:20.87]Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
[01:26.40]So mothers be good to your daughters too
[01:32.13]
[01:43.83]Oh you see that skin
[01:48.62]It's the same she's been standing in
[01:54.54]Since the day she saw him walking away
[02:00.05]Now she's left cleaning up the mess he made
[02:04.90]
[02:06.63]Fathers be good to your daughters
[02:12.50]Daughters will love like you do
[02:18.22]Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
[02:23.71]So mothers be good to your daughters too
[02:29.38]
[02:30.37]Boys you can break
[02:35.25]Find out how much they can take
[02:39.80]Boys will be strong and boys soldier on
[02:45.34]But boys would be gone
[02:47.58]without warmth of a woman's good, good heart
[02:56.68]
[03:06.06]On behalf of every man, looking out for every girl
[03:11.23]You are the god and the weight of the world
[03:16.87]
[03:18.26]So fathers be good to your daughters
[03:24.10]Daughters will love like you do
[03:29.72]Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
[03:35.30]So mothers be good to your daughters too
[03:41.18]So mothers be good to your daughters too
[03:46.79]So mothers be good to your daughters too
[03:53.21]
