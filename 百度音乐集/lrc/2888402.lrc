[00:47.84]‘Cause everything that they say
[00:49.88]It tells me to go away

[00:56.16]It tells me to stay
[00:58.77]
[01:08.18]They say they can smell the drama

[01:59.70]
[02:03.02]They say you’re like a Monday morning
[02:06.14]I say you’re like a Friday night
[02:09.36]I don’t get their point
[02:11.89]Anytime is a good time for being with you
[02:15.49]
[02:16.26]This heart is a stone
[02:19.09]No one will ever break it
[02:22.46]This heart is a stone
