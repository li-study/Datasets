[00:13.00]You go to my head
[00:20.00]You linger like a haunting refrain
[00:27.00]And I find you spinning round
[00:30.00]In my brain
[00:34.00]Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
[00:43.00]You go to my head
[00:48.00]Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
[00:55.00]And I find the very mention of you
[01:03.00]Like the kicker in a tulip or two
[01:12.00]The thrill of the thought
[01:15.00]That you might give a thought
[01:19.00]To my plea, casts a spell over me
[01:25.00]Still I say to myself
[01:30.00]Get ahold of yourself
[01:34.00]Can't you see that it never can be
[01:40.00]You go to my head with a smile
[01:47.00]That makes my temperature rise
[01:53.00]Like a summer with a thousand Julys
[02:00.00]You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
[02:09.00]Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
[02:17.00]Hasn't a ghost of a chance
[02:22.00]In this crazy romance
[02:28.00]You go to my head, you go to my head
