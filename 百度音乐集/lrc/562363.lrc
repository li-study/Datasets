[00:06.14]the saltwater room
[00:13.14]Owl City
[00:23.56]
[00:35.10]I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
[00:43.83]Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
[00:47.87]staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
[00:52.20]I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
[01:00.84]Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
[01:04.80]Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
[01:09.35]You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
[01:17.70]Running into the dark underground
[01:20.70]All the subways around create a great sound
[01:26.24]To my motion fatigue: farewell
[01:32.26]With your ear to a seashell
[01:35.08]You can hear the waves in underwater caves
[01:39.93]As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
[01:44.67]
[01:54.40]Time together is just never quite enough
[01:59.00]When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
[02:02.87]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[02:07.29]We need time, only time
[02:11.76]When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
[02:15.77]If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
[02:19.76]So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
[02:24.81]All the time, all the time
[02:28.49]
[02:28.73]Can you believe that the crew has gone
[02:34.46]and wouldn't let me sign on?
[02:37.20]All my islands have sunk in the deep,
[02:41.17]so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
[02:45.50]I feel as if I were home some nights
[02:51.18]when we count all the ship lights
[02:54.07]I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
[02:58.34]We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
[03:03.42]
[03:04.69]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[03:11.53]Time together is just never quite enough
[03:18.21]When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
[03:22.32]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[03:26.49]We need time, only time
[03:31.87]When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
[03:35.29]If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
[03:39.13]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[03:44.36]All the time, all the time
[03:54.82]
[04:05.40]Time together is just never quite enough
[04:10.06]When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
[04:13.74]What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[04:17.67]So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
[04:26.26]All the time
