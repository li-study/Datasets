[00:40.78]If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
[00:49.27]Drying in the colour of the evening sun
[00:54.69]Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
[01:00.84]But something in our minds will always stay
[01:06.58]Perhaps this final act was meant
[01:09.46]To clinch a lifetime's argument
[01:12.11]That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
[01:17.75]For all those born beneath an angry star
[01:23.49]Lest we forget how fragile we are
[01:27.00]On and on the rain will fall
[01:33.95]Like tears from a star, like tears from a star
[01:40.72]On and on the rain will say
[01:45.56]How fragile we are, how fragile we are
[02:37.61]On and on the rain will fall
[02:42.48]Like tears from a star, like tears from a star
[02:48.56]On and on the rain will say
[02:53.71]How fragile we are, how fragile we are
[03:00.00]How fragile we are, how fragile we are
