[00:12.91]What's wrong with live
[00:15.49]I don't know
[00:20.13]C'mon!
[00:21.85]
[00:31.78]Caught in the mess, got nobody tu trust
[00:34.24]Just haters in your back, ready tu bust
[00:36.93]All alone on your own and I can feel your pain
[00:39.49]Because heaven on earth it's really hard to obtain
[00:42.29]And now you're running around searching for the right
[00:45.05]What's wrong or right, is it worth to fight
[00:47.49]I don't know, believe me it's truth
[00:50.36]If I get the chance I will save you
[00:52.75]
[00:53.25]Save me, from the rain and hold me
[00:56.80]Ease that pain, don't rape me
[00:59.37]And leave me into life (I wll save you)
[01:03.26]Don't ever take me, the must in me
[01:06.46]And make me feel love again so free
[01:10.00]All the things I've got to hide (Don't leave me)
[01:14.41]
[01:17.13]On and on, and nothing really changed, it's strange
[01:20.30]Live slipping out of your hands, is this the best way
[01:23.11]Just to get it right
[01:24.97]shadows passing by in the middle of the night
[01:27.55]Just tell me why it's gotta be like that
[01:30.14]The gamble of the live keeps your neck in check
[01:32.63]And now you're crying out for help
[01:34.70]And believe me it's truth
[01:36.13]If I get the chance I will save you
[01:38.17]
[01:38.67]Save me, from the rain and hold me
[01:42.41]Ease that pain, don't rape me
[01:44.99]And leave me into life (I wll save you)
[01:48.35]Don't ever take me, the must in me
[01:51.67]And make me feel love again so free
[01:55.24]All the things I've got to hide(Don't leave me)
[01:59.54]
[02:00.98]What's wrong with live
[02:06.62]Just haters in the back
[02:12.08]Searching for the life
[02:16.79]What's wrong or right
[02:18.83]I don't know…
[02:20.60]
[02:31.60]Like a swan in a cage, what does it take to stop
[02:34.59]And open it up to make you fly away
[02:36.93]to make your beauty shine thru the deserts of faith
[02:39.47]But I guess it's to late
[02:40.79]You're already made yourself up, ready to die
[02:44.85]God knows you cry and I can't lie
[02:47.43]It makes me going mad
[02:49.11]And believe me it's truth
[02:50.59]If I get the chance I will save you
[02:53.74]
[02:55.64]Save me, from the rain and hold me
[02:59.62]Ease that pain, don't rape me
[03:02.21]And leave me into life (I will save you)
[03:06.05]Don't ever take me, the must in me
[03:09.22]And make me feel love again so free
[03:12.76]All the things I've got to hide
[03:16.02]
[03:27.78]Save me, from the rain and hold me
[03:31.52]Ease that pain, don't rape me
[03:34.16]And leave me into life (I will save you)
[03:37.75]Don't ever take me, the must in me
[03:41.12]And make me feel love again so free
[03:44.62]All the things I've got to hide
