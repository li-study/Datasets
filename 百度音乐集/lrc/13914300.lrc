[00:25.24]Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
[00:29.51]He could handle everything; he was my granddad
[00:35.02]He grew his own food and fixed his own car
[00:40.15]I watched it all happen in our backyard
[00:44.49]
[00:47.04]He'd reinvent the part to fix the broken home
[00:52.95]
[00:57.83]He restored the heart
[01:03.59]well I wish I was a fixer
[01:08.80]I would fix you up inside
[01:14.09]I would build you a town if the world fell down
[01:19.68]I wish I was that guy
[01:23.40]
[01:28.36]If Frank D. Fixer were alive today
[01:32.59]Well he may laugh at me and he may have a lot to say
[01:37.93] he might ask that I keep working for the family
[01:43.10]To keep the bills all paid and be his protégé
[01:50.31]What happened to the ground right where we are
[01:58.33]
[02:00.87]What happened to the family farm
[02:07.07]well I wish I was a fixer
[02:12.08]I would fix you up inside
[02:17.39]I would build you a town if the world fell down
[02:22.95]I wish I was that guy
[02:26.45]
[02:37.11]Every evening breaking bread
[02:41.06]He showed us who a real man is
[02:46.27]No matter what my grandma says
[02:51.72]He would never lose his head
[02:59.58]well I wish I was a fixer
[03:04.81]I would fix you up inside
[03:10.12]I would build you a town if the world fell down
[03:15.74]I wish I was that guy
[03:19.51]
[03:20.68]well I wish I was a farmer
[03:25.85]I would grow you a Garden of Eden
[03:31.30]and I would bless the family with the gifts that granddad handed me
[03:36.76]How wonderful that would be
[03:42.02]Baby I'll make that guy be me
[03:46.29]
