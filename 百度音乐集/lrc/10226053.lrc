[00:00.66]The Tower
[00:04.30]
[00:38.12]Where do I go?
[00:45.05]Never had a very real dream before.
[00:47.95]Now I got a vision of an open door.
[00:51.00]Guiding me home, where I belong,
[00:54.05]dreamland I have come.
[00:57.22]Oh where do I go?
[01:00.02]Never had a flesh and blood like this before.
[01:01.75]Got a new appearance when I passed the door.
[01:03.60]Is it a dream I am withing? Oh what's going on?
[01:09.48]Down, down, down
[01:10.60]Go down, go down, go down
[01:13.74]I roam into nowhere.
[01:20.19]Don't see an end: eternal wastelands.
[01:32.03]And I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice...
[01:43.19]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...
[02:07.45]Never been a fighter,
[02:09.92]neber been a man.
[02:13.39]But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend.
[02:19.50]Nowhere to go but I know that he knows how
[02:27.88]we will get her out...
[02:32.00]Magic of transcendence
[02:34.83]brought me to this place
[02:37.56]Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race.
[02:40.72]Told me to bring back the seal
[02:43.94]but still I don't know where I shall go.
[02:56.22]Can't you 'feel' the voice?
[03:02.33]You don't have a choice.
[03:08.45]What a kind of life:
[03:14.99]Freedom in flesh - shackles on your mind...
[03:21.95]Go all the way to the tower!
[03:28.13]Find out the secrets behind!
[03:33.91]Go all the way to the tower!
[03:40.15]For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die.
[04:01.53]Men have good intentions
[04:04.31]on their way to the light.
[04:07.25]But som of them are venal
[04:10.29]and end up in the night.
[04:13.56]Maybe it's better for you, mankind,
[04:19.24]not to know what's going on.
[04:25.83]Sometimes we must go
[04:32.00]ways that seem to be wrong.
[04:38.09]What a kind of life: Freedom in flesh,
[04:44.11]shackles on your mind...
[04:51.89]Go all the way to the tower!
[04:57.95]Find out the secrets behind!
[05:03.78]Go all the way to the tower!
[05:09.95]Find out the name of the one
[05:14.56]who reigns from inside...
[05:28.15]You have come the long way through ages
[05:31.31]to bring me the seven parts of the seal.
[05:36.65]So now throw it over the walls of the tower.
[05:41.19]Throw the seal!
[05:44.34]But first Godfather, what about the prophecy? What
[05:49.16]about your reward: The ultimate illumination, the
[05:52.51]gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on
[05:55.81]earth with a strong hand?
[05:59.21]What about the prophecy?
[06:13.70]I realize...
[06:17.05]For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
[06:20.25]For the glory. Oh - what is going on?
[06:27.17]For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
[06:31.64]For the glory. Oh - what is going on?
[07:56.92]Gabriel I can feel:
[08:00.65]You have it back - book and seal.
[08:06.74]Still no war is won, we have just begun...
[08:19.66]Go all the way to the tower!
[08:25.81]Long for the secrets behind!
[08:31.48]Go all the way to the tower!
[08:37.95]Found out the name of the one
[08:42.68]who reigns from inside...
[08:44.60]Go all the way to the tower!
[08:50.55]Long for the secrets behind!
[08:56.23]Go all the way to the tower!
[09:02.31]Found out the name of the one,
[09:06.82]Of the one...
[09:18.92]Oh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?
[09:23.28]Was it my fault?
[09:25.54]Or was it no one's fault at all?
