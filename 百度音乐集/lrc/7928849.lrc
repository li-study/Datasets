[00:26.73]Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
[00:33.70]Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
[00:39.72]Still a little hard to say what's going on
[00:48.24]
[00:53.16]Still a little bit of your ghost your witness
[00:59.49]Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
[01:05.95]You step a little closer each day
[01:09.92]that I can't say what's going on
[01:13.33]
[01:18.17]Stones taught me to fly
[01:24.17]Love taught me to lie
[01:30.35]Life taught me to die
[01:36.43]So it's not hard to fall
[01:40.65]When you float like a cannonball
[01:46.67]
[02:09.58]Still a little bit of your song in my ear
[02:17.41]Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
[02:23.73]You step a little closer to me
[02:27.36]So close that I can't see what's going on
[02:31.91]
[02:35.90]Stones taught me to fly
[02:42.05]Love taught me to lie
[02:49.02]Life taught me to die
[02:54.33]So it's not hard to fall
[02:57.87]When you float like a cannonball
[03:01.74]Stones taught me to fly
[03:07.98]Love taught me to cry
[03:13.95]So come on courage! Teach me to be shy
[03:20.18]'Cause it's not hard to fall
[03:24.10]And I don't wana scare her
[03:27.42]It's not hard to fall
[03:30.67]And I don't wanna lose
[03:33.72]It's not hard to grow
[03:37.60]When you know that you just don't know
[03:43.84]
