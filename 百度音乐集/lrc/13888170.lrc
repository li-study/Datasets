[00:24.07]Tonight it's been a year
[00:30.14]we met each other here
[00:35.53]Here I am all alone
[00:42.02]as thoughts of you go on
[00:47.05]
[00:47.72]Hear me cryin' out to you
[00:53.84]you said, "Never, never would I leave"
[00:59.76]Here's a tear from me to you
[01:06.01]and maybe it will make you hear me
[01:12.30]
[01:12.76]I loved you
[01:18.32]You didn't feel the same
[01:24.40]Though we're apart
[01:27.33]You're in my heart
[01:30.15]Give me one more chance to
[01:33.43]Make it real
[01:39.31]
[01:47.71]In a dream you are here
[01:54.06]You smile and hold me near
[01:59.72]And in my heart I'll pretend
[02:06.06]that you are here again
[02:11.06]
[02:11.72]Hear me cryin' out to you
[02:17.95]You said, "Never, never would I leave"
[02:23.89]Here's a tear from me to you
[02:30.04]and maybe it will make you hear me
[02:36.30]
[03:25.65][02:36.77]I loved you
[03:30.80][02:42.47]You didn't feel the same
[03:36.68][02:48.48]Though we're apart
[03:39.96][02:51.39]You're in my heart
[03:42.48][02:54.07]Give me one more chance to
[03:45.79][02:57.43]Make it real
[03:53.92][03:03.61]
[03:54.62]Give me one more chance to
[03:57.82]Make it real
