[00:00.08]Arcade Fire - The Suburbs
[00:01.56]
[00:16.46]In the suburbs I
[00:21.23]I learned to drive
[00:24.26]And you told me we'd never survive
[00:29.43]Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'
[00:32.91]
[00:41.94]You always seemed so sure
[00:46.18]That one day we'd fight in
[00:50.19]In a suburban world
[00:54.05]your part of town gets minor
[00:57.41]So you're standin' on the opposite shore
[01:02.36]But by the time the first bombs fell
[01:05.52]We were already bored
[01:10.67]We were already, already bored
[01:13.96]
[01:14.73]Sometimes I can't believe it
[01:18.70]I'm movin' past the feeling
[01:22.60]Sometimes I can't believe it
[01:26.86]I'm movin' past the feeling again
[01:31.00]
[01:38.89]Kids wanna be so hard
[01:43.54]But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
[01:51.59]And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
[01:59.11]And all of the houses they build in the seventies finally fall
[02:05.96]Meant nothin' at all
[02:07.86]Meant nothin' at all
[02:09.84]It meant nothin
[02:11.02]
[02:11.64]Sometimes I can't believe it
[02:15.37]I'm movin' past the feeling
[02:19.54]Sometimes I can't believe it
[02:23.74]I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night
[02:29.06]
[02:44.16]So can you understand?
[02:47.84]Why I want a daughter while I'm still young
[02:55.47]I wanna hold her hand
[02:57.80]And show her some beauty
[02:59.93]Before this damage is done
[03:02.30]
[03:05.56]But if it's too much to ask, it's too much to ask
[03:10.94]Then send me a son
[03:13.09]
[03:16.94]Under the overpass
[03:20.75]In the parking lot we're still waiting
[03:24.90]It's already passed
[03:28.98]So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
[03:35.02]Cause it's already passed
[03:37.66]It's already, already passed!
[03:40.46]
[03:40.85]Sometimes I can't believe it
[03:45.04]I'm movin' past the feeling
[03:49.07]Sometimes I can't believe it
[03:53.12]I'm movin' past the feeling again
[03:57.83]
[04:01.79]I'm movin' past the feeling
[04:09.42]I'm movin' past the feeling
[04:14.32]
[04:26.82]In my dreams we're still screamin'
[04:35.98]We're still screamin'
[04:44.04]We're still screamin'
[04:53.49]
