[00:12.34]The smart money＇s on Harlow
[00:15.56]And the moon is in the street
[00:19.12]The shadow boys are breaking all the laws
[00:26.16]And you＇re east of East St. Louis
[00:29.29]And the wind is making speeches
[00:33.86]And the rain sounds like a round of applause
[00:41.33]Napoleon is weeping in the Carnival saloon
[00:48.18]His invisible fiance is in the mirror
[00:55.42]The band is going home
[00:58.99]It＇s raining hammers, it＇s raining nailsYes,
[01:03.08]it＇s true, there＇s nothing left for him down here
[01:10.84]And it＇s Time Time Time
[01:18.28]And it＇s Time Time Time
[01:25.55]And it＇s Time Time TimeThat you love
[01:33.62]And it＇s Time Time Time
[01:41.72]And they all pretend they＇re orphans
[01:45.15]And their memory＇s like a train
[01:48.45]You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
[01:55.58]And the things you can＇t remember
[01:58.22]Tell the things you can＇t forget that
[02:02.91]History puts a saint in every dream
[02:09.81]Well she said she＇d stick around
[02:13.89]Until the bandages came off
[02:17.23]But these mama boys just don＇t know when to quit
[02:24.34]And Matilda asks the sailors are those dreams
[02:27.53]Or are those prayers
[02:31.60]So just close your eyes son
[02:34.12]And this won＇t hurt a bit
[02:39.52]And it＇s Time Time Time
[02:46.87]And it＇s Time Time Time
[02:53.72]And it＇s Time Time TimeThat you love
[03:01.43]And it＇s Time Time Time
[03:09.73]Well things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
[03:15.94]The boys just dive right off the cars
[03:19.45]And splash into the streets
[03:23.70]And when they're on a roll
[03:27.01]she pulls a razor from her boot
[03:30.30]and a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
[03:38.56]So put a candle in the window
[03:42.79]And a kiss upon his lips
[03:45.80]Till the dish outside the window fills with rain
[03:53.59]Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
[04:01.23]And pay the fiddler off till I come back again
[04:09.10]And it＇s Time Time Time
[04:16.95]And it＇s Time Time Time
[04:23.83]And it＇s Time Time TimeThat you love
[04:31.61]And it＇s Time Time Time
[04:39.94]And it＇s Time Time Time
[04:46.44]And it＇s Time Time Time
[04:54.15]And it＇s Time Time TimeThat you love
[05:03.27]And it＇s Time Time Time
