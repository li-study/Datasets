[00:00.52]Down To Earth
[00:03.52]Justin Bieber
[00:06.52]
[00:11.77]I never thought it would be easy
[00:14.70]Cause we both so distant now
[00:17.63]And the walls are closing in on us
[00:20.94]And we're wondering how
[00:23.30]No one has a solid answer
[00:26.27]But just walking in the dark
[00:29.43]And you can see the look on my faces
[00:32.09]And it just tears me apart
[00:34.39]So we fight through the hurt
[00:40.46]And we cry and cry and cry and cry
[00:46.36]And we live and we learn
[00:52.15]And we try and try and try and try
[00:57.90]So it's up to you and it's up to me
[01:04.25]That we meet in the middle on our way
[01:08.30]back down to Earth
[01:11.13]
[01:12.30]Down to Earth, Down to Earth
[01:18.80]On our way back down to Earth
[01:22.83]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[01:25.65]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[01:28.54]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[01:31.39]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth
[01:33.78]Mama you're always somewhere
[01:36.63]And Daddy I live out of the town
[01:39.44]So tell how could I ever be
[01:42.92]normal somehow
[01:44.90]You tell me this is for the best
[01:47.71]So tell me why you and I are in tears
[01:51.03]Oh so far away
[01:53.40]And now I just need you here
[01:56.44]So we fight through the hurt
[02:02.37]And we cry and cry and cry and cry
[02:08.26]Then we live and we learn
[02:13.85]And we try and try and try and try
[02:19.79]So it's up to you and it's up to me
[02:26.11]That we meet in the middle on our way
[02:30.23]back down to Earth
[02:33.35]
[02:34.15]Down to Earth, Down to Earth
[02:40.81]On our way back down to Earth
[02:45.07]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[02:47.50]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[02:50.46]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth,
[02:53.35]Back down to Earth, Back down to Earth
[02:57.47]We fell so far away from where we used to be
[03:03.18]Now we're standing and where do we go
[03:09.10]When there's no road to get to your heart
[03:14.92]Let's start over again
[03:18.37]So it's up to you and it's up to me
[03:24.23]That we meet in the middle on our way
[03:28.84]back down to Earth
[03:32.81]Down to Earth, Down to Earth
[03:39.40]On our way back down to Earth
[03:42.57]I never thought it would be easy
[03:45.13]Cause we both so distant now
[03:48.47]And the walls are closing in on us
[03:51.37]And we're wondering how
