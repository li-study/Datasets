[00:17]When I'm done with thinking, then I'm done with you
[00:26]When I'm done with crying, then I'm done with you
[00:35]When I feel so tired, then I'm done with you
[00:44]Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way.
[00:53]And I do.
[00:56]You can hear it, but I do.
[01:00]You can hear it, but I do.
[01:05]You're trying to convince me that what I've done's not right
[01:14]I get so frustrated, I stay up every night.
[01:23]You ask me for an answer, and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air.
[01:32]Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way
[01:40]And I do.
[01:44]You can't hear it but I do
[01:48]You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say
[01:54]I will be ignored
[01:56]I will be denied
[01:59]I could be erased
[02:00]I could be brushed aside
[02:03]I will get scared, and I will get shoved down
[02:07]but I feel like I do because you push me around.
[02:48]And I do
[02:51]You can't hear it but I do
[02:55]You don't seem angry but I do
[03:01]I do.
