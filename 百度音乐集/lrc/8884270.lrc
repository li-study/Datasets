[14:12.594]Dream Gets Clear
[02:04.840]Written by: Sophie Zelmani
[03:08.693]
[16:02.961]I'm a stranger on this way
[13:58.618]yet I come here once a year
[12:20.583]and it starts to get romantic
[05:42.113]'cause no one's ever there
[11:36.263]and with the thought
[05:17.660]that I could find him there
[09:21.392]makes it to a place
[10:56.092]for dreaming
[14:44.217]and the dream gets clear
[07:09.479]
[06:06.393]Maybe it was the sunset
[09:10.522]that said it'd come up
[12:15.428]as a metaphore if you
[04:06.165]woke me for your breezes
[14:34.578]I've underrated you before
[06:34.011]and with the feeling
[03:04.455]that I'd meet him there
[06:16.576][08:45.287]makes it to a place
[01:14.841][14:03.830]for dreaming
[01:58.910][04:41.199]and the dream gets clear
[17:04.679][05:46.178]
[15:09.830]The ground's too hard
[04:36.814]to suit you, still I wanted
[12:31.405]to lay down
[05:44.294]Time went so differently
[05:16.879]I was under the sun
[00:29.693]and with the vision
[03:12.545]of seeing him there
[11:40.009]makes it to a place
[08:32.404]for dreaming
[11:53.327]and the dream gets clear
[00:32.034]
[07:51.065]I left at noon
[09:35.356]with new notes in my ears
[01:03.040]Whatever you were playing
[09:00.906]I know that it was rare
[02:50.823]and with the sound
[12:14.345]of hearing him there
[04:34.050]made it to a place
[01:15.918]for dreaming
[15:12.638]and the dream was clear
[03:26.286]
[04:58.635]end
