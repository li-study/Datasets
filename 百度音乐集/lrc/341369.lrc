[00:02.49]From Sarah With Love
[00:03.66]Sarah Connor
[00:04.75]
[00:15.62]For so many years we were friends
[00:18.22]And yes I always knew what we could do
[00:23.58]But so many tears in the rain
[00:26.26]Felt the night you said
[00:28.72]That love had come to you
[00:31.55]I thought you were not my kind
[00:33.97]I thought that I could never feel for you
[00:39.52]The passion and love you were feeling
[00:42.65]And so you left
[00:44.59]For someone new
[00:47.57]And now that you're far and away
[00:51.29]I'm sending a letter today
[00:55.21]From Sarah with love
[00:58.86]She'd got the lover she is dreaming of
[01:03.95]She never found the words to say
[01:06.58]But I know that today
[01:08.45]She's gonna send her letter to you
[01:11.58]From Sarah with love
[01:15.38]She took your picture to the stars above
[01:19.44]And they told her it is true
[01:23.42]She could dare to fall in love with you
[01:27.49]So don't make her blue when she writes to you
[01:31.88]From Sarah with love
[01:37.87]So maybe the chance for romance
[01:40.94]Is like a train to catch before it's gone
[01:45.85]And maybe it's just on illusion
[01:48.68]To hope behind the clouds
[01:50.90]You'll find the sun
[01:53.81]And I'Il keep on hoping and praying
[01:56.57]And there'll be a day
[01:58.44]When we meet again
[02:02.05]And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming
[02:05.08]You're strong enough
[02:06.95]To understand
[02:09.95]As long as you're so far away
[02:13.92]I'm sending a letter each day
[02:19.38]From Sarah with love
[02:23.40]She'd got the lover she is dreaming of
[02:27.80]She never found the words to say
