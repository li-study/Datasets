[00:21.39]
[00:23.24]So far away from me to see
[00:29.37]When no relief is at the door terminally
[00:35.64]I've no intention to sing a sad song
[00:38.65]But everything I wanna say never felt so wrong
[00:42.29]And every hour in my day feels like a week
[00:46.80]
[00:48.03]Those days you find yourself in a place without a light...
[00:53.11]
[02:41.86][02:29.66][02:17.31][01:37.30][00:53.99]Sometimes you might find you feel a little like
[02:46.58][02:33.92][02:20.43][01:42.04][00:58.53]You're on the wrong side of life
[02:48.72][02:35.85][02:24.12][01:44.09][01:00.85]Where's no light. But it's gonna turn around
[02:52.52][02:39.57][02:27.83][01:47.78][01:04.70]Sometime so nevermind
[02:55.19][01:50.18][01:06.45]
[01:06.95]The place you thought you'd never be
[01:12.97]Close to the bone but still too far away to see
[01:19.07]You've got the voice and all the intention
[01:21.89]But your head wont't pay your heart no attention
[01:25.56]And your heart just won't relay the news down to your feet
[01:30.11]
[01:31.33]'My my' what a silly thing to think you're the only one what you thinking of
