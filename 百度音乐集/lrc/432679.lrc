[00:27.24]I've been alone with you inside my mind
[00:34.32]And in my dreams I've kissed 
[00:36.89]your lips a thousand times
[00:41.20]I sometimes see you pass outside my door
[00:47.66]Hello, is it me you're looking for
[00:54.31]I can see it in your eyes
[00:57.65]I can see it in your smile

[01:04.10]and my arms are open wide
[01:08.05]Cause you know just what to say 
[01:11.32]and you know just what to do
[01:14.78]And I want to tell you so much,
[01:18.41]
[01:20.28]I love you
[01:21.96]
[01:34.39]I long to see the sunlight in your hair
[01:39.78]And tell you time and time again, 
[01:44.07]how much I care
[01:47.85]Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
[01:53.70]Hello, I've just got to let you know
[02:01.37]Cause I wonder where you are
[02:04.52]and I wonder what you do
[02:07.97]Are you somewhere feeling lonely 
[02:11.34]or is someone loving you?
[02:14.79]Tell me how to win your heart 
[02:18.13]for I haven't got a clue
[02:21.79]But let me start by saying,
[02:24.82]
