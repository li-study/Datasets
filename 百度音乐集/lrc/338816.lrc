[00:05.00]Just a Dream
[00:10.93]
[00:16.01]It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
[00:21.30]All dressed in white
[00:25.09]Going to the church that night
[00:28.89]She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
[00:34.97]Sixpence in a shoe,
[00:37.59]something barrowed, something blue
[00:42.45]And when the church doors opened up wide
[00:46.95]She put her veil down
[00:48.58]Trying to hide the tears
[00:53.38]Oh she just couldn't believe it
[00:56.60]She heard trumpets from the military band
[01:00.70]And the flowers that I never had
[01:04.38]Baby why'd you leave me
[01:05.83]Why'd you have to go
[01:07.35]I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
[01:12.12]I can't even breathe
[01:15.59]It's like I'm looking from a distance
[01:19.30]Standing in the background
[01:21.28]Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
[01:24.66]This can't be happening to me
[01:29.47]This is just a dream
[01:34.28]
[01:37.62]The preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
[01:42.80]Lord please lift his soul
[01:46.57]and heal this hurt
[01:50.81]Then the congregation all stood up and sang
[01:56.79]the saddest song that she ever heard
[02:04.05]Then they handed her a folded up flag
[02:08.23]And she held on to all she had left of him
[02:14.69]Oh, and what could have been
[02:17.55]And then the guards rang one last shot
[02:21.79]And it felt like a bullet in her heart
[02:25.58]Baby why'd you leave me
[02:27.12]Why'd you have to go
[02:28.43]I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
[02:33.19]I can't even breathe
[02:36.74]It's like I'm looking from a distance
[02:40.35]Standing in the background
[02:42.34]Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
[02:46.29]This can't be happening to me
[02:50.54]This is just a dream
[03:01.27]Oh,Baby why'd you leave me
[03:07.62]Why'd you have to go
[03:08.97]I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
[03:14.47]Oh, now I'll never know
[03:17.05]It's like I'm looking from a distance
[03:20.98]Standing in the background
[03:22.80]Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
[03:26.98]This can't be happening to me
[03:31.03]This is just a dream
[03:40.02]
[03:43.18]Oh, this is just a dream
[03:58.87]Just a dream
[04:06.10]Yeah, Yeah
