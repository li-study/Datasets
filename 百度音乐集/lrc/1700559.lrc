[00:09.12]What if I never knew
[00:13.37]What if I never found you
[00:17.28]I'd never have this feeling in my heart
[00:23.96]
[00:26.03]How did this come to be
[00:30.23]I don't know how you found me
[00:34.74]But from the moment I saw you
[00:38.55]Deep inside my heart I knew
[02:51.36][01:49.36][00:41.98]
[02:53.43][01:50.21][00:42.84]Baby you're my destiny
[02:57.60][01:54.43][00:47.06]You and I were meant to be
[03:01.54][01:58.33][00:51.20]With all my heart and soul
[03:05.27][02:02.12][00:54.84]I give my love to have and hold
[03:09.65][02:06.54][00:59.12]And as far as I can see
[02:10.79][01:03.39]You were always meant to be my destiny
[03:35.72]
[03:14.05]From now until eternity
[03:18.16]You were always meant to be
[03:24.35]My destiny
[01:15.00][01:10.26]
[01:16.40]I wanted someone like you
[01:20.75]Someone that I could hold on to
[01:25.22]And give my love until the end of time
[01:31.34]
[01:33.00]But forever was just a word
[01:37.60]Something I'd only heard about
[01:42.05]But now you're always there for me
[01:45.55]When you say forever I believe
[02:17.65]
[02:19.73]Maybe all we need is just a little faith
[02:27.88]'Cause baby I believe that love will find the way
[03:27.09][02:35.56]
[03:28.67]You're my destiny
