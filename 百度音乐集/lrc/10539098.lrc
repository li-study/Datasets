[00:16.21]Heavy eyes, heavier skin
[00:19.75]Can't describe this place that I'm in
[00:23.32]Don't look down, don't look back
[00:26.90]Can't lose hope, can't lose track
[00:29.95]
[00:30.55]Reach inside pull out the core
[00:34.08]'Cause I get tired and that gets old
[00:37.62]I'm not so scared my head's on straight
[00:41.40]It's right here and I can't wait
[00:44.21]
[00:44.80]Yesterday, so far away
[00:48.36]Tomorrow, so far to go
[00:51.96]I can't stay, no time for fun
[00:55.35]The long road waits
[00:57.03]And I'm on the run
[00:59.94]
[01:04.44]I'm on the run
[01:07.10]
[01:13.45]Last in line, first to the red
[01:17.03]Distant light, somewhere ahead
[01:20.61]All alone caught in between
[01:23.99]The world gets cold and I get mean
[01:27.01]
[01:27.61]The world wakes up, the light so strong
[01:31.18]The daylight fades, it won't be long
[01:34.76]The night gets dark and I get wild
[01:38.31]And I can't help it that's my style
[01:41.49]
[01:42.11]Yesterday, so far away
[01:45.65]Tomorrow, so far to go
[01:49.26]I can't stay, no time for fun
[01:52.62]The long road waits
[01:54.36]And I'm on the run
[01:57.45]
[02:10.76]Yesterday, so far away
[02:14.33]Tomorrow, so far to go
[02:17.91]I can't stay, no time for fun
[02:21.31]The long road waits
[02:23.01]And I'm on the run
[02:24.46]
[02:25.08]Yesterday, so far away
[02:28.66]Tomorrow, so far to go
[02:32.22]I can't stay, no time for fun
[02:35.64]The long road waits
[02:37.33]And I'm on the run
[02:40.32]
[02:44.64]I'm on the run
[02:47.45]
[02:51.91]I'm on the run...
