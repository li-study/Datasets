[00:00.00]
[00:01.44]Maybe no one told you there is strength in your tears
[00:09.04]And so you fight to keep from pouring out
[00:16.79]But what if you unlock the gate keeps your secret soul
[00:23.60]Do you think there's enough you would drown?
[00:29.15]
[00:29.68]If no one will listen
[00:33.14]If you decide to speak
[00:36.87]If no one's left standing after the bombs explode
[00:44.80]If no one wants to look at you
[00:48.35]For what you really are
[00:52.57]I will be here still
[00:55.86]
[01:03.55]No one can tell you where you alone must go
[01:11.24]There's no telling what you will find there
[01:18.59]And, God, I know the fear eats away at your bones
[01:25.33]It's screaming every step, "Just stay here"
[01:30.03]
[01:30.86]If no one will listen
[01:34.65]If you decide to speak
[01:38.33]If no one's left standing after the bombs explode
[01:45.91]If no one wants to look at you
[01:49.46]For what you really are
[01:54.75]I will be here still
[01:57.38]
[02:23.04]If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down
[02:30.92]If your legs have given out under the weight
[02:38.68]If you find you've been settling for a world of gray
[02:47.17]So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate
[02:51.87]
[03:18.99][02:52.37]If no one will listen
[03:22.58][02:56.08]If you decide to speak
[03:26.35][02:59.88]If no one's left standing after the bombs explode
[03:33.92][03:07.55]If no one wants to look at you
[03:37.20][03:11.17]For what you really are
[03:42.49][03:16.02]I will be here still
[03:45.47][03:18.20]
[03:49.58]I will be here still
[03:53.43]
