[02:07.81][00:31.71][00:16.46]When the day is done
[02:10.49][00:19.82]Down to earth then sinks the sun
[02:14.66][00:23.71]Along with everything that was lost and won
[02:18.76][00:46.84][00:27.95]When the day is done.
[00:35.16]Hope so much your race will be all run
[00:39.27]Then you find you jumped the gun
[00:42.12]Have to go back where you began
[00:49.85]When the night is cold
[00:52.63]Some get by but some get old
[00:56.54]Just to show life's not made of gold
[01:00.46]When the night is cold.
[01:04.40]When the bird has flown
[01:08.20]Got no-one to call your own
[01:12.13]Got no place to call your home
[01:16.00]When the bird has flown.
[01:33.97]When the game's been fought
[01:37.34]Newspapers blow across the court
[01:41.33]Lost matches sooner than you would have thought
[01:45.20]Now the game's been fought.
[01:49.76]When the part is through
[01:53.18]Seems so very sad for you
[01:57.02]Didn't do the things you meant to do
[02:00.90]Now there's no time to start anew
[02:04.63]Now the part is through.
