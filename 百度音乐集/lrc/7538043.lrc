[00:38.12]Whenever dark has fallen
[00:43.19]you know the spirit of the party
[00:46.53]starts to come alive.
[00:48.73]Until the day is dawning
[00:53.23]We can throw out all your blues
[00:57.25]and hit the city lights.
[00:58.75]Cause there's music in the air
[01:00.83]and lots of loving everywhere
[01:03.27]so gimme the night. Gimme the night.
[01:22.42]
[01:22.91]You need the evening action,
[01:28.03]a place to dine, a glass of wine,
[01:30.49]a little late romance.
[01:33.34]It's a chain reaction.
[01:37.96]You'll see the people of the world
[01:41.17]coming out to dance.
[01:43.28]Cause there's music in the air
[01:45.51]and lots of loving everywhere
[01:48.07]so gimme the night. Gimme the night.
[01:58.00]
[02:37.40]And if we stay together,
[02:42.41]we'll feel the rhythm of the evening
[02:44.81]taking us up high.
[02:47.69]Never mind the weather.
[02:51.75]We'll be dancing in the street
[02:55.53]until the morning light.
[02:57.21]Cause there's music in the air
[03:00.86]and lots of loving everywhere.
[03:01.98]So gimme the night. Gimme the night...
