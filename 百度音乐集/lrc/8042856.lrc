[00:09.42]
[00:34.58]When I am sad and weary
[00:38.09]When all my hope is gone
[00:41.93]And I can't put my finger
[00:45.22]On the time things first went wrong
[00:48.84]
[00:49.34]I have a little secret
[00:52.98]I like to tell myself
[00:56.67]And until now
[00:58.62]I haven't told anybody else
[01:03.48]You may not see things my way,
[01:06.58]Like my methods or my reasons
[01:10.88]But you can't tell me that I'm wrong
[01:17.48]There's no heart you can't melt
[01:20.18]with a certain little smile
[01:24.25]No challenge should be faced without a little charm
[01:29.00]and a lot of style
[01:31.16]Don't put your faith in time,
[01:34.24]she heals but doesn't change
[01:38.07]and only a fool won't take the chance to stay the same
[01:48.59]When I am sad and weary
[01:52.11]When all my hopes are gone
[01:56.33]I walk around my house and think of you with nothing on
[02:03.03]I have a list of things I go over in my mind
[02:10.46]When I can just sit right back and watch the world unwind
[02:17.35]You may not see things my way,
[02:20.51]I don't care 'cos I'm not asking
[02:24.35]but you can't tell me that I'm wrong
[02:31.12]There's no heart you can't melt
[02:33.74]with a certain little smile
[02:38.07]No challenge should be faced without a little charm
[02:42.57]and a lot of style
[02:44.88]Don't put your faith in time,
[02:48.29]she heals but doesn't change
[02:51.77]and only a fool wouldn't take the chance to stay the same
[03:02.94]
[03:25.31]There's no heart you can't melt
[03:27.94]with a certain little smile
[03:32.11]No challenge should be faced without a little charm
[03:36.69]and a lot of style
[03:39.11]Don't put your faith in time,
