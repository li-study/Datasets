[00:32.68]There are days when she's a whisper
[00:37.18]Nights when she's a scream
[00:40.46]A reason to wake up in the morning
[00:44.67]To close your eyes and dream
[00:48.67]She'll curse you like a sailor
[00:52.58]She'll wound you with her eyes
[00:56.64]She always makes it better
[01:00.59]But won't apologize
[01:04.67]You know everything about her but don't know her at all
[01:12.84]She's a ride on a mystery train
[01:20.55]To a place you've never been before
[01:28.46]Better hold on tight to that mystery train
[01:36.55]But now I'm not in Kansas anymore

[01:58.61]She sings songs when she's mad
[02:02.36]Like a stiff drink when you need it
[02:06.45]She's good at being bad
[02:10.35]And long before you knew her you knew she was the one

[02:18.95]She's a ride on a mystery train
[02:26.39]To a place you've never been before
