[04:18.72][04:15.12][04:10.52][03:15.67][01:09.18][00:47.30][00:24.71]Hold on my heart
[03:42.06][00:29.57]Just hold on to that feeling
[03:48.59][00:34.52]We both know we've been here before
[03:53.85][00:41.84]We both know what can happen
[00:51.75]'Cause I'm looking over your shoulder
[00:58.05]Ooh please don't rush in this time
[01:04.09]Don't show her how you feel
[01:14.05]Throw me a lifeline
[01:20.39]I'll keep a place for you
[01:26.34]Somewhere deep inside
[03:59.61][03:37.52][01:30.34]So hold on my heart
[01:36.37]Please tell her to be patient
[01:42.02]'Cause there has never been a time
[01:48.14]That I wanted something more
[02:50.88][01:54.23]
[02:06.36]If I can recall this feeling
[02:10.95]And I know there's a chance
[02:39.90][02:14.56]Oh I will be there
[02:44.89][02:19.77]Yes I will be there
[02:25.61]Be there for you
[02:30.94]Whenever you want me to
[02:36.33]Whenever you call
[03:19.74]Don't let her see you crying
[03:26.11]No matter where I go
[03:32.12]She'll always be with me
[04:04.09]Just hold on my heart
