[00:00.00]Josh Groban - Broken Vow
[00:13.89]
[00:15.89]Tell me his name
[00:17.26]I want to know
[00:22.79]The way he looks
[00:24.08]And where you go
[00:27.65]I need to see his face
[00:30.24]I need to understand
[00:34.66]Why you and I came to an end
[00:38.89]
[00:41.57]Tell me again
[00:42.94]I want to hear
[00:48.15]Who broke my faith in all these years
[00:52.73]Who lays with you at night
[00:54.77]When I'm here all alone
[00:59.40]Remembering when I was your own
[01:03.50]
[01:04.39]I'll let you go
[01:08.55]I'll let you fly
[01:11.62]Why do I keep on asking why
[01:17.69]I'll let you go
[01:20.66]Now that I found
[01:24.38]A way to keep somehow
[01:31.38]More than a broken vow
[01:41.27]
[01:44.76]Tell me the words I never said
[01:50.98]Show me the tears you never shed
[01:55.78]Give me the touch
[01:57.31]That one you promised to be mine
[02:02.14]Or has it vanished for all time
[02:06.58]
[02:07.06]I'll let you go
[02:10.45]I'll let you fly
[02:13.57]Why do I keep on asking why
[02:19.68]I'll let you go
[02:22.98]Now that I found
[02:26.51]A way to keep somehow
[02:32.95]More than a broken vow
[02:40.83]I close my eyes
[02:44.82]And dream of you and I
[02:47.24]And then I realize
[02:50.99]There's more to life than only bitterness and lies
[02:57.17]I close my eyes
[03:04.86]
[03:14.39]I'd give away my soul to hold you once again
[03:21.58]And never let this promise end
[03:26.20]I'll let you go
[03:29.89]I'll let you fly
[03:33.16]Now that I know why I'm asking why
[03:39.55]I'll let you go
[03:42.76]Now that I found
[03:46.36]A way to keep somehow
[03:56.06]More than a broken vow
[04:06.68]
