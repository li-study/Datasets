[02:26.97][00:19.76]Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
[00:25.04]Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
[00:29.59]A young girl with eyes like the desert
[02:32.27][00:34.78]It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[00:39.00]Chorus
[03:17.30][02:57.10][02:36.86][01:27.41][00:39.33]Tropical the island breeze
[03:19.79][02:59.45][02:39.09][01:29.55][00:41.81]All of nature, wild and free
[03:22.39][03:01.74][02:41.43][01:31.92][00:43.92]This is where I long to be
[03:24.61][03:04.07][02:43.87][01:34.08][00:46.11]La isla bonita
[03:27.28][03:06.95][02:46.60][01:37.05][00:49.12]And when the samba played
[03:29.55][03:09.12][02:48.89][01:39.19][00:51.12]The sun would set so high
[03:31.75][03:11.15][02:51.00][01:41.38][00:53.62]Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[03:33.99][03:13.53][02:53.12][01:43.58][00:55.56]You Spanish lullaby
[01:07.73]I fell in love with San Pedro
[01:13.22]Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
[01:17.69]Te dijo te amo
[01:22.95]I prayed taht the days would last
[01:25.65]They went so fast
[01:56.09]I want to be where the sun warms the sky
[02:00.35]When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
[02:05.37]Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
[02:09.90]Where a girl loves a boy
[02:12.01]And a boy loves a girl
