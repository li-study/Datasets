[00:48.99]to make you feel the way that i do
[00:52.22]i was swept away
[00:56.84]without a warning
[00:58.81]like night when the morning begins the day
[01:02.73]i was swept away
[01:08.57]and so it begins
[01:09.62]this journey of love
[01:11.43]the summer wind carries us to places all our own
[01:19.45]the words of a look
[01:21.25]the language of touch
