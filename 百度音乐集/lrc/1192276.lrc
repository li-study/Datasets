[00:26.00]I've had enough of danger
[00:33.00]And people on the streets
[00:38.00]I'm looking out for angels
[00:44.00]Just trying to find some peace
[00:50.00]Now I think it's time
[00:56.00]That you let me know
[01:02.00]So if you love me
[01:05.00]Say you love me
[01:08.00]But if you don't just let me go...
[01:14.00]'Cos teacher
[01:18.00]There are things that I don't want to learn
[01:25.00]And the last one I had
[01:29.00]Made me cry
[01:35.00]So I don't want to learn to
[01:38.00]Hold you, touch you
[01:44.00]Think that you're mine
[01:49.00]Because it ain't no joy
[01:55.00]For an uptown boy
[01:58.00]Whose teacher has told him good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
[02:09.00]When you were just a stranger
[02:15.00]And I was at your feet
[02:20.00]I didn't feel the danger
[02:26.00]Now I feel the heat
[02:32.00]That look in your eyes
[02:39.00]Telling me no
[02:43.00]So you think that you love me
[02:46.00]Know that you need me
[02:50.00]I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
[02:53.00]Just let me go...
[02:57.00]And teacher
[03:01.00]There are things
[03:02.00]That I don't want to learn
[03:08.00]Oh the last one I had
[03:14.00]Made me cry
[03:18.00]So I don't want to learn to
[03:21.00]Hold you, touch you
[03:27.00]Think that you're mine
[03:31.00]Because it ain't no joy
[03:37.00]For an uptown boy
[03:41.00]Whose teacher has told him good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
[04:26.00]So when you say that you need me
[04:30.00]That you'll never leave me
[04:33.00]I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
[04:36.00]Let me go
[04:40.00]And teacher
[04:43.00]There are things
[04:46.00]That I still have to learn
[04:51.00]But the one thing I have is my pride
[05:00.00]Oh so I don't want to
[05:03.00]Hold you, touch you
[05:10.00]Think that you're mine
[05:14.00]Because there ain't no joy
[05:20.00]For an uptown boy
[05:23.00]Who just isn't willing to try
[05:30.00]I'm so cold
[05:33.00]Inside
[05:36.00]Maybe just one more try...
