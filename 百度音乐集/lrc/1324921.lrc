[00:00.10]Mockingbird
[00:00.20]Eminem 
[00:00.30]
[00:03.14]Yeah
[00:05.00]I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
[00:10.60]But hey, what daddy always tell you?
[00:14.26]Straighten up little soldier
[00:16.67]Stiffen up that upper lip
[00:19.50]What you crying about?
[00:21.39]You got me
[00:22.01]
[00:22.63]Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
[00:25.48]Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
[00:28.54]I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
[00:31.57]I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
[00:34.29]Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
[00:35.71]Daddy's with you in your prayers
[00:37.10]No more crying, wipe them tears
[00:38.47]Daddy's here, no more nightmares
[00:39.92]We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
[00:42.05]Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
[00:43.77]Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
[00:45.69]We're all we got in this world
[00:47.04]When it spins, when it swirls
[00:48.37]When it whirls, when it twirls
[00:49.81]Two little beautiful girls
[00:51.27]Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
[00:52.59]I know it's confusing you
[00:54.01]Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
[00:56.82]I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
[00:59.32]The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
[01:02.12]All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
[01:05.03]Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
[01:07.98]We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
[01:10.49]But things have gotten so bad between us
[01:12.09]I don't see us ever being together ever again
[01:15.00]Like we used to be when we was teenagers
[01:16.72]But then of course everything always happens for a reason
[01:19.63]I guess it was never meant to be
[01:21.45]But it's just something we have no control
[01:23.26]over and that's what destiny is
[01:25.11]But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
[01:27.62]Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
[01:30.35]
[01:30.65]Now hush little baby, don't you cry
[01:33.36]Everything's gonna be alright
[01:35.35]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
[01:38.57]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
[01:41.04]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
[01:44.78]We feel how we feel inside
[01:46.74]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
[01:49.45]But i promise momma's gon' be alright
[01:52.14]
[01:52.59]It's funny
[01:53.05]I remember back one year when daddy had no money
[01:56.47]Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
[01:57.61]And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
[02:00.86]Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
[02:01.62]I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
[02:04.91]Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
[02:07.71]But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
[02:10.69]And at the time every house that we lived in
[02:13.00]Either kept getting broke into and robbed
[02:15.11]Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
[02:18.89]Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
[02:21.91]Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
[02:25.25]And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
[02:27.58]And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
[02:30.35]Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
[02:33.62]On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
[02:36.44]And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
[02:39.19]And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
[02:42.86]And flew you and momma out to see me
[02:44.73]But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
[02:47.49]Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
[02:51.33]And you and Laney were to young to understand it
[02:52.77]Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
[02:56.21]And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
[02:59.44]I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
[03:01.09]Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
[03:03.83]Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
[03:06.93]Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
[03:09.20]To see how much you both have grown,
[03:10.59]it's almost like you're sisters now
[03:13.62]Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
[03:16.59]Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
[03:19.40]I like the sound of that, yeah
[03:20.85]It's got a ring to it don't it?
[03:22.63]Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
[03:24.43]
[03:24.66]Now hush little baby, don't you cry
[03:27.21]Everything's gonna be alright
[03:29.47]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
[03:32.48]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
[03:35.12]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
[03:38.71]We feel how we feel inside
[03:40.69]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
[03:43.34]But i promise momma's gon' be alright
[03:46.20]
[03:46.46]And if you ask me too
[03:47.63]Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
[03:49.98]I'mma give you the world
[03:52.00]I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
[03:53.89]I'mma sing for you
[03:55.09]I'll do anything for you to see you smile
[03:57.91]And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
[04:01.33]I'mma break that birdies neck
[04:03.06]I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
[04:06.24]And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)
[04:10.14]
