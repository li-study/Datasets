[00:01.34]Santa Monica
[00:03.47]Savage Garden
[00:06.22]
[00:18.49]Santa Monica ......
[00:34.24]
[00:56.68]Santa Monica...In Santa Monica in the winter time
[01:08.03]The lazy streets so undemanding
[01:13.82]I walk into the crowd
[01:19.64]In Santa Monica you get your coffee from
[01:23.50]The coolest places on the promenade
[01:29.20]Where people dress just so
[01:35.03]Beauty so unavoidable
[01:39.35]everywhere you turn
[01:41.93]It's there
[01:43.04]I sit and wonder what am I doing here?
[01:49.56]But on the telephone line I am anyone
[01:53.13]I am anything I want to be
[01:56.97]I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer
[02:01.62]And you wouldn't know the difference
[02:04.73]Or would you?
[02:05.99]
[02:14.09]In Santa Monica, all the people got
[02:17.43]modern names
[02:20.09]Like Jake or Mandy
[02:23.51]And modern bodies too
[02:28.66]In Santa Monica, on the boulevard,
[02:32.95]You'll have to dodge those in-line skaters
[02:39.42]Or they'll knock you down
[02:44.74]I never felt so lonely,
[02:49.43]Never felt so out of place
[02:52.29]I never wanted something more than this
[02:59.17]But on the telephone line I am anyone
[03:02.89]I am anything I want to be
[03:06.75]I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer
[03:11.21]And you wouldn't know the difference
[03:14.72]On the telephone line, I am any height
[03:18.56]I am any age I want to be
[03:22.25]I could be a caped crusader, or
[03:25.21]space invader
[03:26.72]And you would know the difference
[03:29.79]Or would you?
[03:31.75]
