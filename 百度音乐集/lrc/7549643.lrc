[00:27]So long ago, I don't remember when
[00:31]That's when they say I lost my only friend
[00:36]Well, they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
[00:40]As I listened through the cemetery trees
[00:53]I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
[00:58]The long broken arm of human law
[01:03]Now, it always seemed such a waste
[01:05]She always had a pretty face
[01:07]I wondered why she hung around this place
[03:53][02:32][01:19]Hey, come on try a little
[03:59][02:37][01:23]Nothing is forever
[04:02][02:39][01:26]There's got to be something better than
[04:04][02:42][01:28]In the middle
[04:06][02:44][01:30]But me and Cinderella
[04:08][02:46][01:32]We put it all together
[04:10][02:48][01:34]We can drive it home
[04:13][02:53][01:40]With one headlight
[01:49]She said it's cold
[01:51]It feels like Independence Day
[01:54]And I can't break away from this parade
[01:58]But there's got to be an opening
[02:01]Somewhere here in front of me
[02:03]Through this maze of ugliness and greed
[02:07]And I seen the sun up ahead
[02:09]At the county line bridge
[02:12]Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
[02:16]We'll run until she's out of breath
[02:18]She ran until there's nothin' left
[02:21]She hit the end, it's just her window ledge
[03:11]Well, this place is old
[03:13]It feels just like a beat up truck
[03:16]I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
[03:20]Well, it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
[03:23]This place is always such a mess
[03:25]Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
[03:29]I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
[03:34]Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
[03:39]But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
[03:43]I think of death, it must be killin' me...
