[00:00.01]I Have Loved You
[00:18.00]Remember that blue crystal sky
[00:20.28]The sun reflected in your eyes
[00:23.21]Kissed me unexpectedly
[00:29.05]A moment I just can't forget
[00:32.19]We filled the air with promises
[00:35.42]Took them up so tenderly
[00:41.66]But life never asks you what you want
[00:43.89]It's just gonna have its way
[00:47.13]Sometimes it doesn't give like it takes
[00:53.06]If I never see your face
[00:56.60]If wings take you away from me
[01:00.83]And tomorrow never happens, baby
[01:05.07]If the world comes tumbling down
[01:08.30]And crumbles all around us
[01:13.04]Fate turns cruel
[01:15.00]You're on your knees
[01:18.01]So desperate for one truth
[01:24.24]Know that I have loved you
[01:41.48]Don't think I'll write another letter
[01:44.71]Watching there the pink sunset
[01:47.95]Without thinking about you
[01:54.18]I take a walk along the blue seaside
[01:57.02]How will I sleep at night
[02:00.05]How will I wipe the tears from your eyes
[02:06.09]If I never see your face
[02:10.12]If wings take you away from me
[02:14.06]And tomorrow never happens, baby
[02:17.09]If the world comes tumbling down
[02:22.03]And crumbles all around us
[02:26.06]Fate turns cruel
[02:28.00]You're on your knees
[02:31.03]So desperate for one truth
[02:36.07]Know that I have loved you
[02:42.00]Without a single hesitation
[02:47.24]Without thought or reservation
[02:49.07]Baby, I'll be waiting
[02:57.01]Even if I never see your face
[03:02.04]And wings take you away from me
[03:06.10]And tomorrow never happens, baby
[03:10.01]If the world comes tumbling down
[03:13.05]And crumbles all around us
[03:18.08]Fate turns cruel
[03:20.02]You're on your knees
[03:23.05]So desperate for one truth
[03:29.09]Know that I have loved you
[03:38.02]I have loved you
[03:49.06]If I never see your face
[03:51.09]If wings take you away from me
[03:56.03]With all my heart and all my soul
[04:01.06]The world comes tumbling
[04:03.00]And crumbling all around
[04:05.13]I have loved you
[04:11.07]If I never see your face
[04:15.00]If wings take you away from me
[04:20.01]I have loved you
