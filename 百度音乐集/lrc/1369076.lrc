[00:05.51]A Time For Letting Go
[00:12.72]-Michael Bolton-
[00:15.42]-Transcripted By Tsen-
[00:17.90]Sometimes you find out what you wanted
[00:22.38]Isn't really what you need
[00:26.02]And the dream in all its promise
[00:30.56]Was never meant to be
[00:34.57]All your hopes and desperation
[00:38.67]Won't make it like it was
[00:42.97]And you believe the pain will never end
[00:47.34]Believe me in time it does
[00:50.45]You've gotta know when love is over
[00:55.40]You've gotta learn to carry on
[00:59.36]And with the world upon your shoulders
[01:03.80]You walk away when hope is gone
[01:07.70]When your golden road has reached the end
[01:12.98]You find a strength to start again
[01:17.20]You know
[01:20.71]There's a time for love
[01:23.66]A time for letting go
[01:28.76]
[01:33.75]When you're standing tall tomorrow
[01:37.62]Looking back at yesterday
[01:41.87]Through the memory of your sorrow
[01:46.14]How the dawn was so far away
[01:50.10]You'll be far beyond the shadow
[01:54.68]Where hearts can learn to shine
[01:58.70]And youll realize the endless night
[02:03.40]Was only a moment in time
[02:07.05]You've gotta know when love is over
[02:11.59]You've gotta learn to carry on
[02:15.61]And with the world upon your shoulders
[02:19.82]You walk away when hope is gone
[02:24.02]When your golden road has reached the end
[02:28.56]You find a strength to start again
[02:32.89]You know
[02:36.78]There's a time for love
[02:39.07]A time for letting go
[02:46.63]The night is long the night is cold
[02:49.75]With nothing to believe in
[02:55.08]Just hold on, cause life goes on
[02:58.01]Your new day is waiting,
[03:06.93]Let go and let it begin
[03:10.16]You've gotta know when love is over
[03:14.82]You've gotta learn to carry on
[03:19.16]And with the world upon your shoulders
[03:23.50]And the strength when hope is gone
[03:28.04]When your golden road has reached the end
[03:32.72]You find strength to start again
[03:36.63]You know
[03:40.59]There's a time for love
[03:42.84]A time for letting go
[03:54.11]
