[00:33.14]You mesmerise slowly
[00:38.05]Till I can't believe my eyes
[00:42.80]Ecstasy controls me
[00:47.93]What you give just serves me right
[00:50.75]
[00:53.21]Without warning you're here
[00:57.97]Like magic you appear
[01:02.01]I taste the fear
[01:05.13]
[01:08.71]I'm so afraid
[01:13.58]But I still feed the flame
[01:15.23]
[01:16.17]In the night
[01:18.64]Come to me
[01:21.43]You know I want your Touch of Evil
[01:25.92]In the night
[01:27.78]Please set me free
[01:31.12]I can't resist a Touch of Evil
[01:35.65]
[01:46.39]Aroused with desire
[01:51.47]You put me in a trance
[01:56.29]A vision of fire
[02:01.13]I never had a chance
[02:04.58]
[02:06.61]A dark angel of sin
[02:11.30]Preying deep from within
[02:15.48]Come take me in
[02:18.94]
[02:22.08]I'm so afraid
[02:26.83]But I still feed the flame
[02:29.25]
[02:29.56]In the night
[02:32.03]Come to me
[02:34.77]You know I want your Touch of Evil
[02:39.35]In the night
[02:41.14]Please set me free
[02:44.54]I can't resist a Touch of Evil
[02:48.52]
[03:16.40]solo
[04:04.31]
[04:07.47]Arousing me now with a sense of desire
[04:18.01]Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
[04:26.78]
[04:28.58]A dark angel of sin
[04:33.40]Preying deep from within
[04:37.36]Come take me in
[04:42.80]In the night
[04:45.34]Come to me
[04:48.17]You know I want your Touch of Evil
[04:52.66]In the night
[04:54.48]Please set me free
[04:57.90]I can't resist a Touch of Evil
[05:02.39]In the night
[05:04.91]Come to me

[05:12.24]In the night
[05:14.20]Please set me free
[05:17.46]I can't resist a Touch of Evil
