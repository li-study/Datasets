[00:-0.04]Days Of Wine And Roses

[00:05.52]-Andy Williams
[00:06.45]
[00:06.72]The days of wine and roses
[00:18.10]Laugh and run away
[00:23.54]Like a child at play
[00:29.81]Through a meadow land toward a closing door
[00:39.92]A door marked 'nevermore'
[00:46.61]That wasn't there before
[00:52.68]
[00:55.09]The lonely night discloses
[01:05.88]Just a passing breeze
[01:12.04]Filled with memories
[01:18.36]Of the golden smile that introduced me to
[01:31.68]The days of wine and roses
[01:38.49]And you
[01:42.40]
[01:43.83](The lonely night discloses)
[01:54.46]Just a passing breeze
[02:01.05]Filled with memories
[02:07.44]Of the golden smile that introduced me to
[02:21.70]The days of wine and roses
[02:34.43]And you-oo-oo
[02:48.92]
