[00:00.50]Do you have the time to listen to me whine
[00:04.50]About NOTHING and everything all at once
[00:10.50]I am one of those
[00:13.50]Melodramatic fools
[00:15.50]Neurotic to the bone
[00:17.50]No doubt about it
[00:22.50]Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
[00:27.50]Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[00:32.50]It all keeps adding up
[00:35.50]I think I'm CRACKING UP
[00:38.50]Am I just PARANOID?
[00:40.50]Am I just STONED
[00:46.50]I went to a shrink
[00:49.50]To analyze my dreams
[00:52.50]SHE says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
[00:57.50]I went to a whore
[01:00.50]HE said my life's a bore
[01:03.50]So quit my whining cause it's bringing HER down
[01:09.50]Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
[01:15.50]Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[01:19.50]It all keeps adding up
[01:22.50]I think I'm CRACKING UP
[01:24.50]Am I just PARANOID?
[01:38.50]Grasping to CONTROL
[01:43.50]So I BETTER hold on
[02:06.50]Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
[02:12.50]Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[02:16.50]It all keeps adding up
[02:19.50]I think I'm CRACKING UP
[02:21.50]Am I just PARANOID?
[02:24.50]Am I just STONED
