[00:01.08]Ashes (Oliver Smith Remix)
[00:01.53]Oceanlab
[00:02.01]
[00:59.52]Across the eerie waters
[01:02.11]Misty covered glass I spied
[01:05.97]
[01:06.45]A sad procession snaking down
[01:10.08]The dry and deathly trail
[01:12.23]
[01:13.58]And as my telescopic eye
[01:17.05]Focused on the marching line
[01:20.55]It settled on the fallen crown
[01:23.79]Now covered with a veil
[01:26.65]
[01:27.71]The heavy weight of mourning
[01:30.50]Drew each head to face the ground
[01:34.78]Muscles tight on bearer arms
[01:38.02]Each body cold and frail
[01:40.89]
[01:41.90]And through the muslin mist
[01:44.34]The beating drums the only sound
[01:49.02]Twenty boat out in the bay
[01:52.58]All ready to set sail
[01:54.91]
[02:39.03]Ashes take me back to earth
[02:53.01]Water quench my human thirst
[03:07.60]Ashes take me back to earth
[03:21.60]Water quench my human thirst
[03:36.30]
[04:04.32]Ashes take me back to earth
[04:18.53]Water quench my human thirst
[04:32.78]Ashes take me back to earth
[04:47.03]Water quench my human thirst
