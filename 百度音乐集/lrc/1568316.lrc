[00:19.86]I've gone for too long
[00:22.84]Living like I'm not alive
[00:25.87]So I'm gonna start over tonight
[00:29.72]Beginning with you and I
[00:31.00]
[00:31.64]When this memory fades
[00:33.80]I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
[00:37.10]With chances taken, hope embraced
[00:41.68]And have I told you
[00:42.78]
[00:42.95]I'm not going
[00:45.74]cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[00:48.77]And I'm not leaving
[00:51.25]I won't let you
[00:54.86]Let you give up on a miracle
[00:58.81]When it might save you
[01:00.82]
[01:02.13]We've learned to run from
[01:05.43]Anything uncomfortable
[01:09.65]We've tied our pain below
[01:12.36]And no one ever has to know
[01:13.99]
[01:14.22]That inside we're broken
[01:17.20]I try to patch things up again
[01:19.81]To calm my tears and kill these fears
[01:22.47]But have I told you, have I
[01:24.60]
[01:27.31]I'm not going
[01:30.29]Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[01:34.22]And I'm not leaving
[01:35.83]I won't let you
[01:39.04]Let you give up on a miracle
[01:43.21]When it might save you
[01:44.63]
[01:48.34]It's not faith if
[01:50.50]If you use your eyes
[01:54.07]You'll lie
[01:56.68]We'll get it right this time (this time)
[01:59.62]Let's leave this all behind
[02:03.28]Oh, I will get it right this time
[02:08.23]It's not faith if you're using your eyes
[02:10.24]
[02:12.44]Oh, I...
[02:13.84]
[02:14.85]Well I've gone for too long
[02:17.33]Living like i'm not alive
[02:20.17]So I'm gonna start over tonight
[02:26.03]Beginning with you and
[02:26.26]
[02:26.61]I don't want to run from
[02:29.77]Anything uncomfortable
[02:32.43]I just want no
[02:35.82]I just need this pain to end right here
[02:39.79]
[02:40.02]I'm not going
[02:44.21]Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
[02:47.83]And I'm not leaving
[02:49.48]I won't let you
[02:53.17]Let you give up on a miracle
[02:56.52]Cause it might save you
[03:00.73]
[03:02.47]Yeah, it might save you
[03:07.24]Oh, it might save you
[03:10.49]Let's not fake this
[03:13.97]If you use your eyes
[03:17.13]If you use your eyes
[03:19.98]If you use your eyes
