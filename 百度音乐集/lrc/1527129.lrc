[00:01.94]Sunsets, my eyes drop
[00:09.15]Your hand slips away from mine
[00:15.77]
[00:17.79]Car keys, the motor runs
[00:25.39]And just like that you are gone…
[00:31.43]
[00:33.16]Sunrises, I'm in bed
[00:40.18]Your pillow next to me
[00:48.34]Breakfast is one bitter cup of coffee
[00:58.88]With no plans for the day…
[01:06.66]
[01:08.38]Empty, I lay back down
[01:16.02]Not quite ready to face the day…
[01:24.15]Hollow, oh, is this home?
[01:31.83]Maybe one day he'll be back to stay.
[01:39.01]
[01:39.63]Sunrises, its been years
[01:46.50]You call me. My hopes high
[01:54.65]Surprises, is it safe to need you this one time?
[02:10.80]And it’s never quite the right time
[02:17.12]So I’ll wait, you know I don’t mind
[02:24.50]If it’s love, oh truest love,
[02:32.63]open my eyes and see.
[02:38.69]
[02:39.83]Sunrises, I'm in bed,
[02:47.05]Your pillow next to me
[02:54.83]Breakfast is one bitter cup of coffee
[03:04.91]With no plans ahead
[03:08.98]
[03:09.75]Sunrises, it’s been years
[03:16.69]You call me, my hopes high
[03:24.45]Surprises, is it safe to love you this one time?
[03:39.57]
