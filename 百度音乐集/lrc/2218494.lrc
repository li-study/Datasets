[00:10.63]
[00:17.52]Now I know that the end comes
[00:21.39]You knew since the beginning
[00:25.08]Didn't want to believe it's true
[00:29.26]You are alone again
[00:33.08]My soul will be with you
[00:41.00]
[00:44.56]Why's the clock even running
[00:48.54]If my world isn't turning
[00:52.21]Hear your voice in the doorway wind
[00:56.37]You are alone again
[01:00.13]I'm only waiting
[01:03.20]You tear into pieces my heart
[01:06.74]Before you leave with no repentance
[01:10.69]I cried to you, my tears turn into blood
[01:15.96]I'm ready to surrender
[01:18.84]You say that I take it too hard
[01:22.28]And all I ask is comprehension
[01:26.18]Bring back to you a piece of my broken heart
[01:31.43]I'm ready to surrender
[01:37.70]
[01:42.58]I remember the moments
[01:46.50]Life was short for the romance
[01:49.86]Like a rose it will fade away
[01:55.34]I'm leaving everything
[01:58.49]No regrets, war is over
[02:02.02]The return of a soldier
[02:05.88]Put my hands on my bleeding heart
[02:10.34]I'm leaving all behind
[02:13.84]No longer waiting
[02:16.83]You tear into pieces my heart
[02:20.38]Before you leave with no repentance
[02:24.22]I cried to you, my tears turn into blood
[02:29.51]I'm ready to surrender
[02:32.44]You say that I take it too hard
[02:35.95]And all I ask is comprehension
[02:39.79]Bring back to you a piece of my broken heart
[02:42.24]I'm ready to surrender
[02:52.74]I've waited for so long!
[02:56.49]
[03:10.98]You tear into pieces my heart
[03:14.51]Before you leave with no repentance
[03:18.68]I cried to you, my tears turn into blood
[03:23.51]I'm ready to surrender
[03:26.63]You say that I take it too hard
[03:30.00]And all I ask is comprehension
[03:33.95]Bring back to you a piece of my broken heart
[03:39.17]I'm ready to surrender
