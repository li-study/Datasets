[ti:All that I need]
[ar:Boyzone]
[al:Every day I love you]

[00:06.00]
[00:11.00]I was lost and alone
[00:15.00]Trying to grow, making my way down that long winding road
[00:22.00]Had no reason, no rhyme
[00:24.00]Like a song out of time
[00:27.00]And there you were, standing in front of my eyes
[00:33.00]How could I be such a fool
[00:37.00]To let go of love and break all the rules
[00:43.00]Girl when you walked out that door
[00:46.00]left a hole in my heart
[00:49.00]And now I know for sure
[02:36.00][02:05.00][00:52.00]You're the air that I breathe
[02:39.00][02:08.00][00:55.00]Girl you're all that I need
[02:42.00][02:11.00][00:58.00]And I wanna thank you, lady
[02:46.00][02:15.00][01:02.00]You're the words that I read
[02:49.00][02:18.00][01:05.00]You're the light that I see
[02:52.00][02:21.00][01:08.00]And your love is all that I need
[02:26.00][01:14.00]
[01:23.00]I was searching in vain
[01:27.00]Playing a game
[01:29.00]Had no-one else but myself left to blame
[01:33.00]You came into my world
[01:36.00]No diamonds or pearls
[01:39.00]Could ever replace what you gave to me girl
[01:44.00]Just like a castle of sand
[01:47.00]Girl, I almost let love slip right out of my hands
[01:55.00]And just like a flower needs rain
[01:58.00]I will stand by your side through the joy and the pain
[02:57.00]You're the song that I say
[03:00.00]You're my everything
[03:02.00]And I wanna thank you, lady
[03:06.00]You're all that I need, girl
[03:09.00]You're the air that I breathe, yeah
[03:12.00]And I want to thank you
[03:15.00]You're the words that I read, girl
[03:18.00]You're love is all I need, yeah
[03:21.00]And I want to thank you
[03:23.00](and I want to thank you, lady)
[03:27.00]You're all that I need, girl
[03:29.00]You're the air that I breathe, yeah
[03:34.00]And I want to thank you..
[03:39.00]End
