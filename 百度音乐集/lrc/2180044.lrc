[00:21.84]
[00:23.84]There are children standing here,
[00:26.44]Arms outstretched into the sky,
[00:29.52]Tears drying on their face.
[00:32.44]He has been here.
[00:35.27]Brothers lie in shallow graves.
[00:38.18]Fathers lost without a trace.
[00:41.05]A nation blind to their disgrace,
[00:43.80]Since he's been here.
[00:45.36]
[00:58.28][00:46.80]And I see no bravery,
[01:02.26][00:50.86]No bravery in your eyes anymore.
[01:13.08][01:07.65][00:56.34]Only sadness.
[01:15.26][01:09.71][00:57.75]
[01:20.51]Houses burnt beyond repair.
[01:23.27]The smell of death is in the air.
[01:26.45]A woman weeping in despair says,
[01:29.30]He has been here.
[01:31.97]Tracer lighting up the sky.
[01:34.38]It's another families' turn to die.
[01:37.78]A child afraid to even cry out says,
[01:40.56]He has been here.
[01:42.01]
[01:54.59][01:43.39]And I see no bravery,
[01:58.35][01:47.38]No bravery in your eyes anymore.
[02:03.50][01:52.68]Only sadness.
[02:05.75][01:53.87]
[02:15.84]There are children standing here,
[02:18.39]Arms outstretched into the sky,
[02:21.04]But no one asks the question why,
[02:23.74]He has been here.
[02:26.47]Old men kneel to accept their fate.
[02:28.96]Wives and daughters cut and raped.
[02:31.60]A generation drenched in hate.
[02:33.91]Says, he has been here.
[02:36.20]
[03:27.38][03:17.26][02:47.53][02:37.18]And I see no bravery,
[03:30.88][03:20.98][02:51.16][02:40.95]No bravery in your eyes anymore.
[03:40.60][03:35.78][03:25.67][02:45.76]Only sadness.
[03:42.99][03:37.85][02:57.28][02:46.89]
