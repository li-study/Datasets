Chasing Sunsets
词曲：林一峰
There's a time to plant the seeds of hope
There's a time to pray for spring
There's a time to set your dreams in bloom
With all your heart and sing
Enjoying sunsets
That's how you give yourself a rest
Enjoying sunsets
La la la la la la la la
There's a time to face the truth of love
There's a time to compromise
There's a time to step back from it all
Telling your heart to listen to your mind
Watching sunsets
That's how you give yourself a rest
Watching sunsets
Are you happy… to go back
There's a time you finally realize
That you have been so blind
There's a time again you can't decide
To call it quit or be kind, rewind
Chasing sunsets
Why don't you give yourself a rest
Chasing sunsets
Are you happy… to be sad
