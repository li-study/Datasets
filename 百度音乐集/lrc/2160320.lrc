[00:04.00]Chris Daughtry - Home
[00:17.06]I\'m staring out into the night,
[00:22.03]Trying to hide the pain.
[00:28.72]I\'m going to the place where love
[00:36.01]And feeling good don\'t ever cost a thing.
[00:41.66]And the pain you feel\'s a different kind of pain.
[00:50.43]Well I\'m going home,
[00:52.47]Back to the place where I belong,
[00:56.09]And where your love has always been enough for me.
[01:01.18]I\'m not running from.
[01:06.06]No, I think you got me all wrong.
[01:09.97]I don\'t regret this life I chose for me.
[01:14.87]But these places and these faces are getting old,
[01:22.38]So I\'m going home.
[01:25.75]Well I\'m going home.
[01:31.78]
[01:37.52]The miles are getting longer, it seems,
[01:43.40]The closer I get to you.
[01:48.59]I\'ve not always been the best man or friend for you.
[01:55.18]But your love, it makes true.
[01:58.95]And I don\'t know why.
[02:02.20]You always seem to give me another try.
[02:09.48]So I\'m going home,
[02:12.48]Back to the place where I belong,
[02:16.32]And where your love has always been enough for me.
[02:21.21]I\'m not running from.
[02:26.11]No, I think you got me all wrong.
[02:30.04]I don\'t regret this life I chose for me.
[02:36.48]But these places and these faces are getting old,
[02:43.18]Be careful what you wish for,
[02:48.29]\'Cause you just might get it all.
[02:51.14]You just might get it all,
[02:54.67]And then some you don\'t want.
[02:57.85]Be careful what you wish for,
[03:01.76]\'Cause you just might get it all.
[03:04.48]You just might get it all, yeah.
[03:10.79]
[03:17.05]Oh, well I\'m going home,
[03:19.26]Back to the place where I belong,
[03:22.74]And where your love has always been enough for me.
[03:27.73]I\'m not running from.
[03:32.73]No, I think you got me all wrong.
[03:36.66]I don\'t regret this life I chose for me.
[03:42.11]But these places and these faces are getting old.
[03:48.48]I said these places and these faces are getting old,
[03:55.83]So I\'m going home.
[03:59.73]I\'m going home.
