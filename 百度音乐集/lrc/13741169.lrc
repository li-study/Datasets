[00:01.53]One Direction
[00:02.04]
[00:11.41]Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
[00:14.75]Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
[00:19.73]I tore it apart
[00:21.97]And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
[00:26.17]And no woman in the world deserves this
[00:28.47]But here I am asking you for one more chance
[00:33.28]Can we fall, one more time?
[00:38.74]Stop the tape and rewind
[00:43.97]Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
[00:50.19]Cause there is nobody else
[00:55.20]It's gotta be you
[01:01.48]Only you
[01:06.54]It's gotta be you
[01:12.13]Only you
[01:17.78]
[01:24.70]Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
[01:28.35]When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
[01:33.12]You've almost had enough
[01:36.03]And your actions speak louder than words
[01:39.13]And you're about to break from all you've heard
[01:41.82]Don't be scared, I ain't going no where
[01:46.69]I'll be here, by your side
[01:52.29]No more fears, no more crying
[01:57.83]But if you walk away
[02:00.76]I know I'll fade
[02:03.62]Cause there is nobody else
[02:08.62]It's gotta be you
[02:14.91]Only you
[02:19.97]It's gotta be you
[02:25.62]Only you
[02:31.19]Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
[02:35.60]One more, one more, can we try?
[02:38.41]One more, one more time
[02:41.23]I'll make it better
[02:43.96]One more, one more, can we try?
[02:46.87]One more, one more,
[02:48.88]Can we try one more time to make it all better?
[02:53.78]Cos its gotta be you
[02:59.43]Its gotta be you
[03:05.17]Only you
[03:11.37]Only you
[03:16.32]It's gotta be you
[03:22.73]Only you
[03:27.60]It's gotta be you
