[00:08.98]Every night and every day my heart feels the pain
[00:18.60]I wake up to the thought of you and I call your name
[00:28.79]No one ever made me feel the way you do
[00:34.03]Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
[00:38.57]But now I've got to let go
[00:42.95]We don't stand a chance
[00:45.46]In this wild romance, my tender heart
[00:51.01]Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
[00:57.75]With my tender heart.
[01:02.71]We don't stand a chance
[01:05.18]In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad
[01:10.78]Knowing that I'm not the one you want
[01:15.75]I can't hold on to my tender heart
[01:23.15]I never thought I'd be the one who would play the fool
[01:32.92]But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel
[01:42.39]It's clear to me the writing is on the wall
[01:47.53]It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all
[01:52.60]And I can't go on this way
[01:57.24]We don't stand a chance
[01:59.75]In this wild romance, my tender heart
[02:05.21]Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
[02:12.02]With my tender heart.
[02:15.21]We don't stand a chance
[02:17.64]In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad
[02:23.12]Knowing that I'm not the one you want
[02:27.99]I can't hold on to my tender heart
[02:36.55]I'm standing at the door
[02:41.50]Don't need this hurt no more
[02:46.32]I'm crying out in vain
[02:49.72]Cause you don't feel my pain.
[03:15.13]Maybe it was always going to be this way
[03:20.08]Maybe I'll look back and understand some day
[03:25.97]But now I've got to say
[03:32.23]We don't stand a chance
[03:35.15]In this wild romance, my tender heart
[03:40.27]Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
[03:45.21]With my tender heart.
[03:50.11]We don't stand a chance
[03:52.37]In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad
[03:58.02]Knowing that I'm not the one you want
[04:02.88]I can't hold on to my tender heart
[04:09.77]My tender heart
