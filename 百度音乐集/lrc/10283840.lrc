[00:06.16]My Interpretation
[00:10.51]You talk about life, you talk about death,
[00:13.01]And everything in between,
[00:15.19]Like it\'s nothing, and the words are easy.
[00:20.24]You talk about me, and you talk about you,
[00:22.95]And everything I do,
[00:25.03]Like it\'s something, that needs repeating.
[00:30.49]I don\'t need an alibi or for you to realize,
[00:35.94]The things we left unsaid,
[00:37.78]Are only taking space up in our head.
[00:40.93]Make it my fault, win the game
[00:43.36]Point the finger, place the blame
[00:45.89]It does me up and down,
[00:47.79]It doesn\'t matter now.
[00:49.55]\'Cause I don\'t care if I ever talk to you again.
[00:54.86]This is not about emotion,
[00:57.33]I don\'t need a reason not to care what you say,
[01:02.07]Or what happened in the end.
[01:04.58]This is my interpretation,
[01:07.39]And it don\'t, don\'t make sense.
[01:12.14]
[01:20.09]The first two weeks turn into ten,
[01:22.18]I hold my breath and wonder when it\'ll happen,
[01:27.24]Does it really matter?
[01:29.84]If half of what you said is true,
[01:32.44]And half of what I didn\'t do could be different,
[01:37.22]Would it make it better?
[01:40.23]If we forget the things we know.
[01:42.94]Would we have somewhere to go?
[01:45.60]The only way is down, I can see that now.
[01:50.55]If I never talk to you again,
[01:50.62]Because i don\'t care
[01:54.21]This is not about emotion,
[01:57.07]I don\'t need a reason not to care what you say,
[02:01.72]Or what happened in the end.
[02:04.21]This is my interpretation,
[02:07.08]And it don\'t, don\'t make sense.
[02:11.22]
[02:19.91]If I never talk to you again,
[02:36.58]This is not about emotion,
[02:39.35]I don\'t need a reason not to care what you say,
[02:44.04]Or what happened in the end.
[02:46.45]This is my interpretation,
[02:49.38]And it don\'t, don\'t make sense.
[02:58.43]
[03:02.93]And it don\'t have to make no sense to you at all,
[03:06.86]\'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah.
