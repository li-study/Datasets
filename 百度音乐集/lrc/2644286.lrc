[00:13.62]I cried a tear
[00:17.41]you wiped it dry
[00:22.17]I was confused
[00:26.21]you cleared my mind
[00:29.57]I sold my soul
[00:33.68]you bought it back for me
[00:37.28]And held the up
[00:40.27]and gave me dignity
[00:44.76]Somehow you needed me
[00:49.21]You gave me strength
[00:52.51]to stand alone again
[00:56.44]To face the world
[00:59.36]out on my own again
[01:03.85]You put me high
[01:06.99]upon a pedestal
[01:11.68]So high that I could almost see eternity
[01:19.21]You needed me
[01:23.32]you needed me
[01:28.01]And I can't believe it's you
[01:31.53]I can't believe it's true
[01:34.86]I needed you
[01:38.66]and you were there
[01:43.07]And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
[01:48.15]I'd be a fool
[01:51.02]'cause I finally found someone who really cares
[02:01.25]You held my hand
[02:06.14]when it was cold
[02:09.72]When I was lost
[02:13.58]you took me home
[02:17.35]You gave me hope
[02:20.98]when I was at the end
[02:25.02]And turned my lies
[02:27.86]back into truth again
[02:32.49]You even called me "friend"
[02:37.30]You gave me strength
[02:39.80]to stand alone again
[02:44.28]To face the world
[02:47.24]out on my own again
[02:51.68]You put me high
[02:55.16]upon a pedestal
[02:59.52]So high that I could almost see eternity
[03:06.84]You needed me
[03:11.22]you needed me
[03:15.64]You needed me
[03:19.16]you needed me
[03:22.61]
