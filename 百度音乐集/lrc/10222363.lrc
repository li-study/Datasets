[00:10.00]
[00:20.29]I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
[00:24.88]I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
[00:29.44]I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
[00:33.95]Because you're mine,
[00:36.08]I walk the line
[00:38.54]
[00:46.86]I find it very, very easy to be true
[00:52.30]I find myself alone when each day is through

[01:31.17]I walk the line
[01:34.13]
[01:41.95]You've got a way to keep me on your side
[01:46.90]You give me cause for love that I can't hide
[01:51.50]For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
[01:57.34]Because you're mine,
[01:59.35]I walk the line
[02:01.69]
[02:09.71]I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
[02:14.22]I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
[02:19.18]I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
[02:23.89]Because you're mine,
