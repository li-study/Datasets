[00:-01.00]

[00:01.42]Star struck hoes beg me to connect with 'em,
[00:04.15]'Cause I look correct with 'em,
[00:05.53]And knows how to sex them.
[00:07.01]Houses on two acre lakes in the peach state,
[00:09.65]Eat steak and lobster,
[00:11.07]Steady trying to prosper.
[00:12.43]Build up my roster like the old Motown,
[00:15.07]Too much to hold down,
[00:16.44]And the whole world know now.
[00:17.92]I demonstrate stackin' paint platinum tapes,
[00:20.39]And bustin' that ass with groups like Xscape,
[00:22.99]What the deal.
[00:23.82]I wanna see if you can get down,
[00:26.07]Get down like you say you do.
[00:28.71]In the midnight when I wanna feel right,
[00:31.51]All I think about is you.
[00:33.98]Put me in a fly position,
[00:36.63]Make me wanna scream your name.
[00:39.38]And just when you think I've had enough,
[00:41.85]I'm like baby do you think we could do it again.
[00:44.45]'Cause every time you show me that,
[00:47.29]And every which way that you throw my back,
[00:50.04]I just can't get enough,
[00:51.81]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[00:54.07]Let's do it again.
[00:55.63]'Cause every time you show me that,
[00:58.13]And every which way that you throw my back,
[01:00.87]I just can't get enough,
[01:02.94]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[01:05.00]Let's do it again.
[01:06.21]Tingle, tingle, my body,
[01:09.53]You make me, oh baby,
[01:12.04]I ain't been the same since then.
[01:15.16]That night when you put me in a fly position,
[01:19.49]You made me scream your name.
[01:22.02]You can say I'm sprung, I don't give a damn,
[01:25.51]I wanna do it again, and again, and again.
[01:27.97]'Cause every time you show me that,
[01:30.39]And every which way that you throw my back,
[01:33.04]I just can't get enough,
[01:35.05]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[01:37.05]Let's do it again.
[01:38.85]'Cause every time you show me that,
[01:41.07]And every which way that you throw my back,
[01:43.85]I just can't get enough,
[01:46.31]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[01:48.46]Let's do it again.
[01:49.41]When we made love for the first time,
[01:52.64]It felt so good inside.
[01:55.25]I laid across my bed,
[01:57.51]And watched tears run from my eyes.
[02:00.09]Too good to let it go,
[02:02.88]So don't disturb this flow,
[02:05.85]All I know is I can't wait,
[02:08.68]Can't wait to do it again.
[02:11.31]'Cause every time you show me that,
[02:13.50]And every which way that you throw my back,
[02:16.15]I just can't get enough,
[02:18.68]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[02:20.83]Let's do it again.
[02:22.11]'Cause every time you show me that,
[02:24.21]And every which way that you throw my back,
[02:26.86]I just can't get enough,
[02:29.19]I find myself saying let's do it again,
[02:31.49]Let's do it again.
[02:32.57]In the morning,
[02:33.88]Sweet love in the summertime,
[02:36.81]Just your sweet face,
[02:39.96]All laid up next to mine.
