[00:00.00]Bottle It Up
[00:00.01]Sara Bareilles
[00:00.02]Lyrics  :  Metallic Candy(金属糖果）
[00:00.63]There’ll be girls across the nation that will eat this up.
[00:04.27]Babe I know that it’s your soul but could you bottle it up.
[00:07.81]Get down to the heart of it.
[00:09.79]No, it’s my heart.
[00:11.40]You’re shit out of your luck.
[00:13.14]Don’t make me tell you again my love, love, love, love.
[00:19.04]Love, love, love, love.
[00:21.45]
[00:22.44]I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts with her delicate soul.
[00:27.68]I don’t claim to know much,
[00:29.59]Except soon as you start to make room for the parts that aren’t you,
[00:33.95]It gets harder to bloom in a garden of love, love, love, love.
[00:40.73]Love, love, love, love.
[00:43.53]
[00:44.43]Only thing I ever could need,
[00:47.52]Only one good thing worth trying to be
[00:51.43]And it’s love, love, love, love.
[00:58.35]I do it for love, love, love, love.
[01:05.21]
[01:05.93]We can understand the sentiment you’re saying to us.
[01:09.39]Oh, but sensible sells so could you kindly shut up,
[01:12.98]And get started at keeping your part of the bargain.
[01:16.75]Aw please little darlin’,
[01:18.84]You’re killing me sweetly with love, love, love, love.
[01:24.22]Love, love, love, love.
[01:27.37]
[01:27.98]Only thing I ever could need.
[01:31.02]Only one good thing worth trying to be and it's love, love, love, love.
[01:41.72]I do it for love, love, love, love.
[01:48.68]Started as a flicker meant to be a flame.
[01:51.57]Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same.
[01:55.22]Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall.
[01:58.85]Baby’s getting next to nowhere with a back against the wall.
[02:02.79]You meant to make me happy, make me sad.
[02:06.15]Want to make it better better so bad.
[02:09.88]But save your resolutions for your never new year.
[02:13.41]There is only one solution I can see here.
[02:17.80]
[02:18.50]Love you’re all I ever could need.
[02:21.24]Only one good thing worth trying to be
[02:25.11]And it’s love, love, love, love.
[02:32.15]I do it for love, love, love, love.
[02:40.64](Oh, only gonna get get what you give away, so give love, love.
[02:48.32]Only gonna get get what you give away.
