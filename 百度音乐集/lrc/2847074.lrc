[00:01.78]Fall At Your Feet
[00:03.78]Crowded House
[00:05.78]
[00:13.23]I'm really close tonight
[00:17.78]And I feel like I'm moving inside her
[00:22.85]Lying in the dark
[00:27.19]I think that I'm beginning to know her
[00:31.64]Let it go
[00:34.91]I'll be there when you call
[00:39.75]Whenever I fall at your feet
[00:49.70]And you let your tears rain down on me
[00:58.91]Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[01:08.28]You're hiding from me now
[01:12.96]There's something in the way
[01:14.54]that you're talking
[01:17.79]The words don't sound right
[01:22.19]But I hear them all moving inside you go
[01:28.62]I'll be waiting when you call
[01:32.77]Whenever I fall at your feet
[01:43.19]And you let your tears rain down on me
[01:52.64]Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
[02:01.97]The finger of blame has turned upon itself
[02:07.25]And I'm more than willing to offer myself
[02:11.76]Do you want my presence or need my help
[02:17.22]Who knows where that might lead
[02:21.73]I fall at your feet
[02:26.70]
[02:39.22]Whenever I fall at your feet
[02:48.11]And you let your tears rain down on me
[02:57.71]Whenever I fall
[03:02.60]Whenever I fall
[03:06.23]
