[00:01.00]I Look To You
[00:02.00]Whitney Houston
[00:07.52]
[00:10.52]As I lay me down
[00:15.04]Heaven hear me now
[00:19.68]I'm lost without a cause
[00:24.29]After giving it my all
[00:28.30]
[00:28.97]Winter's storm has come
[00:33.94]And darkened my sun
[00:38.51]After all that weâ€™ve been through
[00:43.07]Who on earth can I turn to
[00:46.38]
[00:46.87]I look to you
[00:51.36]I look to you
[00:57.52]After all my strength is gone
[01:02.00]In you I can strong
[01:05.54]I look to you
[01:09.98]I look to you
[01:16.36]And when melodies are gone
[01:21.15]In you I hear a song
[01:24.37]I look to you
[01:34.26]
[01:34.86]About to lose my breathe
[01:39.43]There's no more fighting left
[01:44.11]Sinking to rise no more
[01:48.89]Searching for that open door
[01:53.08]
[01:53.62]And every road that I've taken
[01:58.26]Lead to my regret
[02:03.03]And I don't know if I'm going to make it
[02:07.77]Nothing to do but lift my head
[02:11.03]
[02:11.51]I look to you
[02:15.80]I look to you
[02:22.23]After all my strength is gone
[02:27.04]In you I can be strong
[02:29.93]I look to you
[02:34.84]I look to you
[02:40.58]And when melodies are gone
[02:45.74]In you I hear a song
[02:48.70]I look to you
[02:51.99]
[02:52.57]My levees are broken
[02:54.20]My walls have come
[02:56.48]Tumbling down on me
[02:59.91]
[03:01.32]The rain is falling
[03:03.54]Defeat is calling
[03:05.91]I need you to set me free
[03:09.42]
[03:10.53]Take me far away from the battle
[03:14.33]I need you
[03:16.77]Shine on me
[03:19.05]
[03:19.52]I look to you
[03:24.29]I look to you
[03:30.11]After all my strength is gone
[03:35.26]In you I can be strong
[03:38.26]I look to you
[03:43.03]I look to you
[03:48.93]And when melodies are gone
[03:54.13]In you I hear a song
[03:57.09]I look to you
[04:03.84]
[04:07.93]I look to you
[04:15.29]I look to you
[04:23.71]
