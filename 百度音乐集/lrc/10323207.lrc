[02:08.08][00:24.80][00:16.00]Woo...  Woo...
[00:30.58][00:19.50]Ah...   Ah...
[00:32.27]In the middle of the night
[00:35.33]I go walking in my sleep
[00:37.91]From the mountains of faith
[00:40.25]To a river so deep
[00:43.38]I must be looking for something
[00:46.04]Something sacred I lost
[00:48.64]But the river is wide
[00:51.35]And it's too hard to cross
[00:55.29]And even though I know the river is wide
[00:57.39]I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
[01:00.65]And try to cross to the opposite side
[01:02.66]So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
[01:05.73]In the middle of the night
[01:08.52]I go walking in my sleep
[01:11.16]Through the valley of fear
[01:13.61]To a river so deep
[01:16.70]And I've been searching for something
[01:19.26]Taken out of my soul
[01:21.76]Something I would never lose
[01:24.54]Something somebody stole
[01:28.68]I don't know why I go walking at night
[01:30.31]But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
[01:33.68]I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
[01:35.61]Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
[01:40.53]In the middle of the night
[01:42.96]I go walking in my sleep
[01:45.80]Through the jungle of doubt
[01:48.54]To a river so deep
[01:51.09]I know I'm searching for something
[01:53.98]Something so undefined
[01:56.52]That it can only be seen
[01:59.06]By the eyes of the blind
[02:01.65]In the middle of the night
[02:06.64]
[02:24.50]I'm not sure about a life after this
[02:26.64]God knows I've never been a spiritual man
[02:29.75]Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
[02:32.85]That runs to the promised land
[02:34.80]
[02:37.68]In the middle of the night
[02:40.58]I go walking in my sleep
[02:42.58]Though the desert of truth
[02:45.65]To the river so deep
[02:48.37]We all end in the ocean
[02:51.16]We all start in the streams
[02:53.77]We're all carried along
[02:56.57]By the river of dreams
[02:59.06]In the middle of the night
[03:04.00]......
