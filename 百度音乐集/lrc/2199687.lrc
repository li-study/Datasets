[00:05.30]When you can wear what you feel
[00:09.09]What do you wanna say?
[00:13.19]Now love is a little number that you can wear each day
[00:20.19]As long as you let me be the accessory
[00:25.06]Simply send me on my way
[00:28.73]‘Cause I love love
[00:32.05]I look good in love
[00:36.50]
[00:39.14]When it’s been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time
[00:43.79]That’s how one forgets
[00:46.35]So I reached in the back of my closet, pulled it out
[00:49.90]And tried it on and it still fits
[00:53.32]
[00:54.30]Some cover their pain up with lots of MAC make-up
[00:59.29]But I can’t help but blush
[01:02.73]‘Cause I’m in love
[01:05.92]All dressed up in love

[01:31.70]All dressed up in love
[01:35.83]
[01:39.15]People are looking, some even staring
[01:43.16]I know I’m glowing, when they ask me what I’m wearing
[01:46.59]See this old thing, it’s great for any weather
[01:50.97]My friend and I sit down and we both made it together
[01:54.39]
[01:54.88]Now if you really want one of your own
[01:58.71]I hope your shoes are made for walking
[02:02.60]‘Cause I found love, and you must find love
[02:09.99]
[02:11.51]I’m all dressed up in love
[02:13.88]And I’m cool in the summer, warm in the winter!
