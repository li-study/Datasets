[00:16.53]It’s exciting
[00:19.93]In the beginning
[00:21.99]The first four weeks
[00:23.30]When you f*ck five times a day
[00:27.18]
[00:27.54]But something happens
[00:29.98]It all starts slipping
[00:32.79]You chew off your own arm
[00:34.74]Just to get away
[00:36.02]
[00:38.29]It’s not you
[00:39.74]And it’s not me
[00:41.06]I’d rather play Halo on my t.v.
[00:43.69]It’s no defence but it’s all I’ve got to say
[00:47.08]
[00:48.79]Well Tommy got tired of Pamela
[00:51.43]Ed got tired of Selma
[00:54.19]Puffy got tired of Jlo and Ben did too
[00:59.54]Heff gets tired of that playboy girl
[01:02.40]Someone’s even tired of Miss Nude World
[01:05.10]I’m just tired of you
[01:08.94]
[01:18.39]I can remember
[01:21.84]In the beginning
[01:24.21]When you were Wonder Woman
[01:26.55]With a cape
[01:29.85]Then something happened
[01:32.81]And the walls started closing in
[01:34.95]And I would have shot myself just to escape
[01:38.56]
[01:40.32]Its not you
[01:41.36]And its not me
[01:42.84]We’re just not singing in harmony
[01:45.89]It’s no defence but its all I got to say
[01:49.81]
[01:50.71]Well Tommy got tired of Pamela
[01:53.58]Ed got tired of Selma
[01:56.33]Puffy got tired of Jlo and Ben did too
[02:01.74]Heff gets tired of that playboy girl
[02:04.20]Someone’s even tired of Miss Nude World
[02:06.89]I’m just tired of you
[02:09.95]
[02:10.63]Someday I’ll find the one
[02:15.21]She’ll be my best friend
[02:16.55]And make me com-
[02:19.70]-plete
[02:21.45]She’ll love everything that I like to do
[02:24.54]And when I find her
[02:28.72]I’ll take two
