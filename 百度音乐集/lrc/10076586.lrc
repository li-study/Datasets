[00:01.74]I Will Survive
[00:02.74]Gloria Gaynor
[00:03.72]
[00:06.38]At first I was afraid I was petrified
[00:10.11]Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
[00:14.33]But then I spent so many nights
[00:16.72]Thinkin' how you did me wrong
[00:18.72]And I grew strong
[00:20.19]And I learn how to get along
[00:22.75]And so you're back from outer space
[00:26.31]I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
[00:30.90]I should have changed that stupid lock
[00:33.01]I should have made you leave your key
[00:35.01]If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
[00:39.10]Go on now, go walk out the door
[00:42.69]Just turn around now
[00:45.25]cause you're not welcome anymore
[00:47.86]Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
[00:51.64]Did I crumble
[00:53.51]Did you think I'd lay down and die
[00:55.91]Oh no  not I I will survive
[00:59.61]Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
[01:04.23]I've got all my life to live
[01:06.07]I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
[01:09.90]I will survive
[01:11.61]
[01:28.05]It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
[01:32.84]Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
[01:36.85]And I spent oh so many nights
[01:39.06]Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry
[01:42.54]But now I hold my head up high
[01:45.39]And you see me somebody new
[01:48.92]I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
[01:53.36]And so you feel like droppin' in
[01:55.53]And just expect me to be free
[01:57.68]Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
[02:01.68]Go on now, go walk out the door
[02:05.64]Just turn around now
[02:07.85]cause you're not welcome anymore
[02:10.83]Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
[02:14.39]Did I crumble
[02:16.08]Did you think I'd lay down and die
[02:18.25]Oh no  not I  I will survive
[02:22.20]Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
[02:26.71]I've got all my life to live
[02:28.75]I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
[02:32.50]I will survive
