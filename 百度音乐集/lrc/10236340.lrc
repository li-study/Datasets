[00:08.02]surrender to me
[00:09.09]
[00:09.67]Richard Marx & Lara Fabian
[00:10.40]
[00:11.83]Fantastic-Desire
[00:12.41]
[00:15.24]Is that what we've been together much too long
[00:21.07]The answer may not be in black and white
[00:26.26]
[00:28.70]We're always trying to prove who's right or wrong
[00:34.63]Yet know we're giving up without a fight
[00:40.34]
[00:41.58]But I know when you're gone
[00:45.00]I'll wish I'd held on
[00:47.66]
[00:48.70]Chorus:
[00:49.71]So, baby, surrender to me
[00:56.54]There'll be no holding back now
[01:03.53]So, baby, surrender to me tonight
[01:16.42]I don't want our love to cause you so much pain
[01:22.11]If this is how it's going to be I'll walk away
[01:29.24]
[01:30.84]Neither one of us should ever say goodbye
[01:36.18]Let's forget about the past and who's to blame
[01:42.01]
[01:42.99]'cause when this is all gone
[01:46.29]We'll wish we'd held on
[01:48.89]
[01:50.47]Chorus
[02:14.58]
[02:16.25]How could this love be in danger
[02:20.32]That used to be so good, so right
[02:29.65]To think that fate could make us strangers
[02:34.37]Has thrown me in your arms tonight
[02:45.15]
[02:46.25]Chorus
[03:32.81](music fade)
