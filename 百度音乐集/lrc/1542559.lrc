[00:01.12]Green Day - Murder City
[00:02.03]
[02:25.18][02:04.35][00:52.98][00:05.63]Desperate
[02:27.15][02:06.08][00:54.90][00:07.43]But not hopeless
[02:30.85][02:09.76][00:58.60][00:11.20]I feel so useless
[02:32.31][02:11.43][01:00.46][00:13.48]In the murder city
[02:35.74][02:14.70][01:03.52][00:16.13]Desperate
[02:37.71][02:16.64][01:05.40][00:17.97]But not helpless
[02:41.40][02:20.32][01:09.14][00:21.71]The clock strickes midnight
[02:43.18][02:22.25][01:11.66][00:24.07]In the murder city
[00:26.81]
[00:27.09]I'm wide awake
[00:28.47]After the riot
[00:32.23]This demonstration
[00:33.93]Of our anguish
[00:37.51]This empty laughter
[00:39.73]Has no reason
[00:42.83]Like a bottle
[00:43.94]Of your favorite poison
[00:47.06]
[00:48.10]We are the last call
[00:50.22]And we're so pathetic
[01:31.02]
[01:35.76]Christian's crying
[01:37.01]In the bathroom
[01:40.84]And I just want to
[01:42.76]Bum a cigarette
[01:46.05]We've come so far,
[01:48.34]We've been so wasted
[01:51.32]It's written
[01:52.33]All over our faces
[02:46.66]
