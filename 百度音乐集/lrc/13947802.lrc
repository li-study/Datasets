[00:01.00]Another sunrise, another sunset
[00:05.10]Soon it'll all be yesterday
[00:08.33]Another good day, another bad day,
[00:12.77]What did you do today?
[00:15.95]Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
[00:19.77]What you want isn't what you have.
[00:23.34]What you have may not be yours, to keep.
[00:31.29]If I could find love, at a stop, in a park with open arms,
[00:39.26]I would save all my love, in a jar,
[00:44.21]made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart,
[00:46.86]Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
[00:54.14]Another left turn, another head turns
[00:58.42]Could he be someone I deserve?
[01:01.54]Another right turn, another lesson learned
[01:06.10]Never leave an open flame to burn
[01:09.18]Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
[01:13.74]What you want isn't what you have.
[01:16.60]What you have may not be yours, to keep.

[01:38.55]sealed in my beating heart,
[01:40.37]Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
[01:51.91]Could you be my love
[01:55.37]Could you be my love
[01:59.21]Could you be my love

[02:10.95]Could you be he love
[02:14.82]Could you be my love
