[00:06.49]Little Boots
[00:18.46]I thought we had a connection
[00:21.96]I thought we had a good thing
[00:24.53]I thought I knew the direction
[00:26.98]That we were heading in
[00:29.62]And I know it's not healthy
[00:32.03]To sit and fantasize
[00:34.62]But I thought we were complete
[00:37.24]At least on the outside
[00:40.85]I know promises fade away
[00:43.27]Have you forgotten yesterday?
[00:45.84]I love you anyway you know
[00:48.83]I thought we clicked like two parts of a puzzle
[00:53.13]Now I'm all in a muddle
[00:55.58]Click like the flick of a switch
[00:58.13]And now the pieces don't seem to fit
[01:00.60]Click like a second in time
[01:03.30]Like you were reading my mind
[01:05.80]Think how we were from the start
[01:08.24]And now our halves are falling a falling apart
[01:20.01]I thought you were my religion
[01:22.53]You had faith in me
[01:24.80]I thought you were a condition
[01:27.60]That no one else could treat
[01:30.14]And I know all your friends say
[01:32.75]That she's out of her mind
[01:35.43]And you're best staying away
[01:37.74]You just don't know what she'll try
[01:41.67]And now my conscience fades away
[01:44.03]A hundred years becomes a day
[01:46.52]I love you anyway you know
[01:49.54]I thought we clicked like two parts of a puzzle
[01:53.84]Now I'm all in a muddle
[01:56.31]Click like the flick of a switch
[01:58.73]And now the pieces don't seem to fit
[02:01.28]Click like a second in time
[02:03.85]Like you were reading my mind
[02:06.35]Think how we were at the start
[02:08.88]And now our halves are falling a falling apart
[02:21.82]I thought we had a connection
[02:24.11]But now I just feel rejection
[02:26.61]Thought that we were perfection
[02:29.15]Things look different in reflection
[02:32.02]Thought you were my religion
[02:34.36]Worshipped everything that you do
[02:37.04]Tell me a part of it was true
[02:39.96]Tell me
[02:41.33]We clicked like two parts of a puzzle
[02:44.29]Now I'm all in a muddle
[02:46.75]Click like the flick of a switch
[02:49.21]And now the pieces don't seem to fit
[02:51.79]Click like a second in time
[02:54.34]Like you were reading my mind
[02:56.82]Think how we were from the start
[02:59.47]And now our halves are falling a falling apart
