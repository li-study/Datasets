[00:00]《The sound of silence》
[00:01]
[00:02]Sung By "Paul Simon"
[00:03]
[00:04]Hello darkness my old friend.
[00:08]I've come to talk with you again.
[00:13]Because a vision softly creeping
[00:18]Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
[00:22]And the vision that was planted in my brain
[00:29]Still remains with the sound of silence
[00:38]In restless dreams I walk alone
[00:43]Narrow streets of cobble stone
[00:47]Beneath the hallo of a street lamp,
[00:52]I turned my collar to the cold and damp
[00:56]When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light
[01:03]That split the night
[01:06]And touched the sound of silence
[01:12]And in the naked night I saw ten thousand people may be more
[01:21]People talking without speaking hearing without listening
[01:30]People writing songs that voices never share
[01:38]And no one dare disturb the sound of silence
[01:47]"Fool" said I "you do not know
[01:51]Silence like a cancer grows
[01:56]Hear my words that I might teach you
[02:00]Take my arms that I might reach you
[02:05]But my words like silent rain-drops fell
[02:14]And echo-ed in the wells of silence
[02:21]And the people bow and prayed
[02:26]to the neon God they made
[02:30]And the sign flash out its warning
[02:34]In the words that it was forming
[02:39]And the sings said "The words of the prophers are
[02:43]written the subway walls and tenement halls"
[02:49]And whispered in the sounds of silence
[02:58]
[02:59]The End.
