[00:03.00]献给我最爱的兰
[00:15.00]Baby tell me where′d you ever learn
[00:21.00]To fight without sayin′ a word
[00:28.00]Then waltz back into my life
[00:32.00]Like it′s all gonna be alright
[00:36.00]Don′t you know how much it hurts
[00:41.00]When we don′t talk
[00:43.00]When we don′t touch
[00:45.00]When it doesn′t feel like we′re even in love
[00:51.00]It matters to me
[00:55.00]When I don′t know what to say
[00:58.00]Don′t know what to do
[01:00.00]Don′t know if it really even matters to you
[01:05.00]How can I make you see
[01:09.00]It matters to me
[01:18.00]Maybe I still don′t understand
[01:25.00]The distance between a woman and a man
[01:32.00]So tell me how far it is
[01:37.00]And how you can love like this′
[01:41.00]Cause I′m not sure I can
[01:45.00]When we don′t talk
[01:47.00]When we don′t touch
[01:49.00]When it doesn′t feel like we′re even in love
[01:55.00]It matters to me
[01:59.00]When I don′t know what to say
[02:01.00]Don′t know what to do
[02:03.00]Don′t know if it really even matters to you
[02:09.00]How can I make you see
[02:13.00]It matters to me
[02:27.00]Oh ~ When I don′t know what to say
[02:29.00]Don′t know what to do
[02:31.00]Don′t know if it really even matters to you
[02:37.00]How can I make you see
[02:40.00]Oh~ It matters to me
[02:48.00]Oh~ It matters to me
[03:14.00]End
