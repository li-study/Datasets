[00:01.00]Lene Marlin - Come Home
[00:02.00]
[00:20.65]I just wanna lock the door
[00:25.29]Leave it all outside
[00:30.05]Turn off the lamps
[00:34.53]I just wanna hide
[00:39.43]Don't bother look for me
[00:43.73]Not even sure that you were
[00:48.66]So I don't have to tell
[00:51.25]I am not feeling well this stays
[00:57.42]
[00:59.44]Just give me directions I go anywhere
[01:04.34]I need to find something I can not find here
[01:08.96]Give me a chance I prove that you are wrong
[01:13.65]I manage to find I can be strong
[01:18.16]And maybe I wanna come home
[01:22.84]That maybe I wanna come home
[01:28.32]
[01:41.03]I just wanna stay in back
[01:45.50]Stay right here for now
[01:50.23]Left it with my thoughts
[01:55.24]I don't know how
[01:59.88]I do face another day
[02:04.48]And I tragedy for it yet
[02:09.19]So I don't have to show that I am not OK this way
[02:17.57]
[02:19.98]Just give me directions I go anywhere
[02:24.86]I need to find something I can not find here
[02:29.48]Give me a chance I prove that you are wrong
[02:34.19]I manage to find I can be strong
[02:38.71]And maybe I wanna come home
[02:43.38]That maybe I wanna come home
[02:48.42]
[02:50.36]Ah Ah Ah  Ah Ah Ah  Ah Ah Ah
[03:06.19]
[03:09.81]Just give me directions I go anywhere
[03:14.53]I need to find something I can not find here
[03:19.29]Give me a chance I prove that you are wrong
[03:23.94]I manage to find I can be strong
[03:28.25]And maybe I wanna come home
[03:33.29]That maybe I wanna come home
[03:38.18]
[03:43.07]Maybe I wanna come home
