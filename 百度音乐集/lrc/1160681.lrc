[00:11.55]
[00:16.21]I never needed you to be strong
[00:19.77]I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
[00:23.51]I never needed pain, I never needed strain
[00:27.12]My love for you is strong enough you should have known
[00:30.85]I never needed you for judgment
[00:34.43]I never needed you to question what I spend
[00:38.12]I never ask for help
[00:39.94]I take care of myself
[00:41.74]I don’t why you think you got a hold on me
[00:44.95]
[00:45.95]And it’s a little late for conversations
[00:49.62]There isn’t anything for you to say
[00:53.28]And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
[00:57.30]So look at me and listen to me because…
[01:00.31]
[01:01.31]I don’t want to stay another minute
[01:04.97]I don’t want you to say a single word
[01:08.47]Hush hush
[01:09.78]Hush hush
[01:11.26]There is no other way, I get the final say
[01:14.99]Because…
[01:15.89]I don’t want to, do this any longer
[01:19.42]I don’t want you, theres nothing left to say
[01:23.03]Hush hush
[01:24.06]Hush hush
[01:25.66]I’ve already spoken, our love is broken
[01:29.46]Baby hush hush
[01:32.09]
[01:33.09]I never needed your corrections
[01:36.67]On everything from how I act to what I say
[01:40.42]I never needed words I never needed hurts
[01:44.11]I never needed you to be there everyday
[01:47.72]I’m sorry for the way I let go
[01:51.36]From everything I wanted when you came along
[01:55.02]But I am never beaten, broken not defeated
[01:58.83]I know next to you is not where I belong
[02:02.06]
[02:03.06]And it’s a little late for explanations
[02:06.68]There isn’t anything that you can do
[02:10.17]And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
[02:14.38]So you will listen when I say baby…
[02:17.17]
[02:18.17]I don’t want to stay another minute
[02:21.77]I don’t want you to say a single word
[02:25.32]Hush hush
[02:26.68]Hush hush
[02:28.11]There is no other way, I get the final say
[02:31.96]Because…
[02:32.83]I don’t want to do this any longer
[02:36.40]I don’t want you there’s nothing left to say
[02:40.04]Hush hush
[02:41.35]Hush hush
[02:42.65]I’ve already spoken, our love is broken
[02:46.42]Baby hush hush
[02:47.55]
[02:48.55]No more words
[02:49.29]No more lies
[02:50.13]No more crying

[02:55.84]No more pain
[02:56.81]No more hurt
[02:57.63]No more trying
[03:01.20]
[03:02.20]I don’t want to stay another minute
[03:05.69]I don’t want you to say a single word
[03:09.39]Hush hush
[03:10.56]Hush hush
[03:12.19]There is no other way, I get the final say
[03:16.36]Because…
