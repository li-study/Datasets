[00:27.31]I thought it was too good to be true
[00:33.27]i found somebody who understands me
[00:37.72]someone who would help me to get through
[00:43.76]and fill an emptiness i had inside me
[00:48.05]but you kept inside and i just denied
[00:53.02]somethings that we should have both said
[00:58.34]i knew it was too good to be true
[01:04.27]'cause i'm the only one who understands me...
[01:07.62]
[01:08.93]What happened to us?
[01:11.40]we used to be so perfect
[01:14.94]now we're lost and lonely
[01:19.23]what happened to us?
[01:22.06]and deep inside i wonder
[01:25.36]did i lose my only?
[01:27.99]
[01:30.01]remember they thought we were too young
[01:35.54]to really know what it takes to make it
[01:39.82]but we had survived off what we had done
[01:45.52]so we could show them all that they're mistaken
[01:50.08]but who could have known, the lies that would grow,
[01:55.32]until we could see right through them
[01:59.98]remember they knew we were too young
[02:06.63]we still dont know what it takes to make it...
[02:09.86]

[02:13.63]we used to be so perfect
[02:17.61]now we're lost and lonely
[02:21.39]what happened to us?
[02:24.19]and deep inside i wonder
[02:27.64]did i lose my only?
[02:30.52]
[02:36.15]we could have made it work, we could have found a way
[02:42.66]we should have done our best to see another day
[02:47.67]but we kept it all inside until it was too late
[02:52.83]and now we're both alone, the consequence we pay
[03:00.71]for throwing it all away, for throwing it all away...
[03:04.93]
