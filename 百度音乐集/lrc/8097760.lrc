[00:03.00]Morningside
[00:10.25]
[00:10.56]I'm not scared of you now
[00:14.69]Or so I say
[00:19.61]There's no reason to run
[00:23.75]Although I may
[00:28.72]I'm not as sure as I seem
[00:33.29]This much I know
[00:37.79]What does it mean you leave and I follow
[00:45.19]
[00:45.98]I could try to forget what you do when I let you get
[00:51.27]Through to me but then you do it over again
[00:55.16]I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire
[00:59.80]'Till you get to me on my morningside
[01:02.92]
[01:14.73]Keep my distance I tried
[01:19.27]No use
[01:23.94]But no matter the miles
[01:28.45]I'm back to you
[01:31.72]
[01:32.35]I could try to forget what you do when I let you get
[01:36.99]Through to me but then you do it over again
[01:41.01]I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire
[01:45.54]'Till you get to me on my morningside
[01:49.09]
[01:50.09]Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
[01:55.05]I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
[01:59.20]Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
[02:04.19]What it looks like here on my morningside
[02:07.30]
[02:09.76]Look back don't you dare let me start to do that
[02:16.13]I don't care if the things that I have
[02:20.63]Only make me afraid to lose I
[02:27.11]Need to let go
[02:29.85]Need to want to keep letting you know
[02:34.31]That we both have a reason to follow
[02:39.61]Long as we let this lead I'm barely breathing
[02:49.90]
[02:50.33]I try to forget what you do to me but then you do it over again
[02:58.56]I could rage you'd bring rain
[03:03.08]'Till you get to me on my morningside
[03:06.52]
[03:07.69]Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever
[03:12.76]I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
[03:16.90]Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
[03:21.74]What it looks like here on my morningside
