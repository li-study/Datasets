[00:11.93]LK luv this song
[00:15.18]
[00:25.14]Baby girl
[00:27.59]Baby I can't let you go
[00:30.01]I think about you all the time
[00:31.55]Think about you all the nights
[00:33.87]You and me we creepin' next to the sea
[00:36.29]You brought the fresh champagne
[00:38.09]And I'd light the fire
[00:40.23]Sometimes I really ask myself
[00:42.96]Do you really wanna lean on this man
[00:46.82]Remember all the beautiful moments
[00:48.96]We share
[00:50.01]My darling please think twice
[00:52.28]
[00:52.91]Baby I
[00:55.07]I swear to god up in the sky
[00:58.38]I'll be your shelter when you cry
[01:02.53]Cause you are my everything
[01:05.84]Baby I
[01:08.27]I travelled around the seven seas
[01:11.48]I'd climb any mountain high
[01:13.34]And speak to you
[01:15.54]Cause you are my everything
[01:18.50]
[01:20.03]Oh I think I'm lost in the wind
[01:22.87]Without you by my side
[01:24.46]There is no one who can hold me
[01:26.56]Together we would fight any storm
[01:29.35]I could show you how
[01:30.98]Just give me your hand now
[01:33.08]I really wanna make you mine
[01:34.66](to make it feel alright)
[01:36.08]Baby for all the time
[01:39.24]I never let you feel down
[01:42.79]Cause you surrender my heart
[01:45.26]
[01:45.78]Baby I
[01:47.63]I swear to god up in the sky

[02:08.28]Cause you are my everything
[02:11.72]

[02:15.47]I wash the teardrops from your skin
[02:19.36]Cause in my dreams
[02:21.10]I've made such a plan
[02:23.84]For you and me
[02:26.19]We built a castle
[02:28.50]Where we could settle down my friend
[02:32.75]Romantic melodies been played
[02:36.53]By the wind
[02:37.64]
[02:39.26]Baby I
[02:43.31]I swear to god up in the sky
[02:46.42]I'll be your shelter when you cry
[02:50.68]Cause you are my everything
[02:54.06]Baby I
