[00:13.96]Electricity, eye to eye
[00:23.44]Hey, don't I know you, I can't speak
[00:32.87]Stripped my senses on the spot
[00:42.61]I've never been defenseless
[00:47.20]I can't even make sense of this
[00:52.06]You speak and I don't hear a word
[00:57.05]
[00:57.96]What would happen if we kissed?
[01:00.97]Would your tongue slip past my lips?
[01:05.59]Would you run away, would you stay
[01:10.41]Or would I melt into you?
[01:15.20]Mouth to mouth, lust to lust
[01:20.42]Spontaneously combust
[01:27.35]
[01:28.14]The room is spinning out of control
[01:37.53]Act like you didn't notice, brushed my hand
[01:47.22]Forbidden fruit, ring on my finger
[01:56.78]You're such a moral, moral man
[02:01.33]You throw it away, no question
[02:06.25]Will I pretend I'm innocent?
[02:11.73]
[02:12.25]What would happen if we kissed?
[02:15.25]Would your tongue slip past my lips?
[02:19.78]Would you run away, would you stay
[02:24.52]Or would I melt into you?
[02:29.93]Mouth to mouth, lust to lust
[02:34.85]Spontaneously combust
[02:40.66]What would happen if we kissed?
[02:47.79]……
[03:11.10]I struggle with myself again
[03:15.82]Quickly the walls are crumbling
[03:20.41]Don't know if I can turn away
[03:24.83]
[03:28.42]What would happen if we kissed?
[03:31.80]Would your tongue slip past my lips?
[03:36.38]Would you run away, would you stay
[03:41.19]Or would I melt into you?
[03:46.62]Mouth to mouth if we kissed
[03:50.93]Would your tongue slip past my lips?
[03:55.72]Would you run away, would you stay
[04:00.40]Or would I melt into you?
[04:05.72]Mouth to mouth if we kissed,
[04:12.53]Er……
[04:17.13]if we kissed
[04:21.98]…………
[04:25.10]Er……
[04:59.32]The End！
