[00:00.54]Oh
[00:02.99]My love
[00:07.27]My darling
[00:11.23]I've hungered for your touch
[00:18.50]A long
[00:21.33]Lonely time
[00:29.23]And time goes by
[00:36.37]So slowly
[00:40.16]And time can do so much
[00:46.71]Are you still mine
[00:55.40]I need your love
[01:05.56]I need your love
[01:12.47]God speed your love to me
[01:27.11]Lonely rivers flow to the seat
[01:32.13]To the seat
[01:34.29]To the open arms of the sea
[01:41.32]Lonely rivers sigh
[01:44.44]"Wait for me, wait for me!"
[01:48.79]"I'll be coming home
[01:51.52]Wait for me!"
[01:56.20]Oh
[01:58.58]My love
[02:03.15]My darling
[02:06.98]I've hungered
[02:08.79]Hungered for your love
[02:13.92]A long
[02:17.17]Lonely time
[02:24.95]Time goes by so slowly
[02:36.01]And time can do so much
[02:42.45]Are you still mine
[02:53.55]I need your love
[03:01.22]I need your love
[03:08.11]God speed your love to me
