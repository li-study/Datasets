[00:04.66]Bed Of Roses
[00:11.31]
[00:12.83]小马依人奉献
[00:34.81]Sitting here wasted and wounded
[00:38.55]at this old piano
[00:43.37]Trying hard to capture
[00:46.00]the moment this morning I don't know
[00:52.13]'Cause a bottle of vodka
[00:54.58]is still lodged in my head
[00:57.20]And some blond gave me nightmares
[00:59.03]I think she's still in my bed
[01:05.67]As I dream about movies
[01:08.09]they won't make of me when I'm dead
[01:11.65]
[01:14.66]With an ironclad fist I wake up and
[01:18.60]French kiss the morning
[01:23.08]While some marching band keeps
[01:25.21]its own beat in my head
[01:28.11]While we're talking
[01:31.87]About all of the things that I long to believe
[01:36.82]About love and the truth and
[01:41.16]what you mean to me
[01:43.62]And the truth is baby you're all that I need
[01:45.35]
[01:51.06]I want to lay you on a bed of roses
[02:00.51]For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails
[02:08.53]I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
[02:18.29]And lay you down on bed of roses
[02:22.41]
[02:28.96]Well I'm so far away
[02:31.93]That each step that I take is on my way home
[02:37.91]A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
[02:41.21]Just to see through this payphone
[02:46.58]Still I run out of time
[02:48.90]Or it's hard to get through
[02:51.67]Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
[02:56.18]I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
[03:00.27]baby blind love is true
[03:03.48]
[03:05.87]I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
[03:15.06]For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails
[03:23.58]I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
[03:33.14]And lay you down on bed of roses
[03:41.20]
[03:43.92]The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
[03:47.91]The barkeeper's wig's crooked
[03:52.75]And she's giving me the eye
[03:54.11]I might have said yeah
[03:57.22]But I laughed so hard I think I died
[04:02.21]
[04:40.22]When you close your eyes
[04:43.57]Know I'll be thinking about you
[04:48.82]While my mistress she calls me
[04:51.84]To stand in her spotlight again
[04:57.02]Tonite I won't be alone
[05:03.60]But you know that don't
[05:06.71]Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
[05:10.95]For it's you that I'd die to defend
[05:12.59]
[05:49.29][05:13.36]I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
[05:58.56][05:23.75]For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails
[06:07.01][05:30.66]I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
[06:16.17][05:41.44]And lay you down on bed of roses
