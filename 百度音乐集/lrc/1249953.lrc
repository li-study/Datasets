[00:00.00]Kevin McCall - Goodbye
[00:02.00]
[00:12.72]I wish everything was the way it used to be before
[00:16.47]
[00:18.40]Before I got used to you
[00:20.64]
[00:21.66]Why can't I just let you deuce
[00:24.02]
[00:26.21]I already did everything I possibly could do
[00:30.11]
[00:31.93]But it don't mean a thing to you
[00:34.24]
[00:35.17]I just can't do right by you
[00:37.55]
[00:40.24]Why should I keep on trying
[00:43.66]If you give up
[00:45.40]Girl I think I've had enough
[00:47.93]Of your shit
[00:49.73]Sick and tired of arguing
[00:52.85]
[00:53.59]And I can't lie
[00:55.57]I'm ready to leave you
[00:57.19]And can't because I don't wanna start over
[01:01.34]And go through it with someone else all over again
[01:06.08]
[01:07.07]Should I stay and be content
[01:08.85]
[01:10.07]Or should I look for the girl of my dreams
[01:13.17]
[01:13.86]Do I try to find what's meant to be
[01:16.44]Or just say goodbye, goodbye
[01:20.43]I know I said I'd never leave
[01:22.13]
[01:24.27]Said I'd never leave
[01:25.50]
[01:27.67]And even though I love you
[01:29.47]
[01:29.91]Girl I'm saying goodbye, goodbye
[01:33.16]
[01:34.40]You said it was over
[01:36.05]
[01:37.59]But now I gotta scream your cause
[01:40.71]And you're constantly coming over
[01:42.92]
[01:44.38]Like we ain't separate at all (separate at all)
[01:48.24]You do it too much
[01:49.71]
[01:51.19]Maybe you're taking it too far
[01:53.49]
[01:54.44]My definition of breaking up
[01:56.57]
[01:57.94]Is living our lives apart
[02:00.61]
[02:01.46]Why did I keep letting walk you in and out my life
[02:06.53]When I know it only gets worse
[02:09.19]Every time
[02:10.76]And I just can't live life like I'm blind
[02:14.06]
[02:14.84]And I can't lie
[02:16.60]I'm ready to leave you
[02:18.33]And can't because I don't wanna start over
[02:22.24]And go through it with someone else all over again
[02:27.13]
[02:28.15]Should I stay and be content
[02:29.91]
[02:31.34]Or should I look for the girl of my dreams
[02:34.11]
[02:34.84]Do I try to find what's meant to be
[02:37.59]Or just say goodbye, goodbye
[02:41.54]I know I said I'd never leave
[02:43.30]
[02:45.39]Said I'd never leave
[02:46.86]
[02:48.76]And even though I love you
[02:50.61]
[02:51.09]Girl I'm saying goodbye, goodbye
[02:54.62]
[03:22.25]Should I stay and be content
[03:23.97]
[03:25.47]Or should I look for the girl of my dreams
[03:28.25]
[03:29.06]Do I try to find what's meant to be
[03:31.48]Or just say goodbye, goodbye
[03:34.75]
[03:35.66]I know I said I'd never leave
[03:37.38]
[03:39.41]Said I'd never leave
[03:41.32]
[03:42.75]And even though I love you
[03:44.64]
[03:45.16]Girl I'm saying goodbye, goodbye
[03:48.65]
