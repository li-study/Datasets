[00:32.11]It's a cruel cruel world, to face on your own
[00:36.21]A heavy cross, to carry along
[00:40.24]The lights are on, but everyone's gone
[00:43.88]And it's cruel
[00:46.16]
[00:48.19]It's a funny way, to make ends meet
[00:51.91]when the lights are out on every street
[00:55.70]It feels alright, but never complete
[00:60.57]without joy

[01:19.88]On the rainy nights, even the coldest days
[01:24.59]You're moments ago, but seconds away

[02:05.19]So choose
