[00:00.-70]Title: Just The Two Of Us
[00:00.-40](Now dad this is a very sensitive subject)

[00:42.81]From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
[00:45.19]I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
[00:47.75]Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?
[00:50.82]Against wrong, choose right and be standin up
[00:53.13]From the hospital that first night
[00:55.19]Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right
[00:57.38]People drivin all fast, got me kinda upset
[01:00.01]Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette
[01:02.88]That night I don't think one wink I slept
[01:05.25]As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
[01:07.82]Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
[01:10.57]Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
[01:12.94]Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
[01:15.75]Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
[01:18.26]Love, knowledge, discipline too
[01:20.75]I pledge my life to you
[01:22.07]
[01:22.69]Chorus:
[01:23.13]Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
[01:28.44]Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
[01:32.92]Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
[01:38.10]Just the two of us, you and I
[01:42.35]Verse 2: Will Smith

[02:24.55]It didn't work out with me an your mom
[02:26.62]But yo, push come to shove

[02:31.70]Remember one fact, I got your back
[02:33.89]Chorus
[02:54.73]Verse 3: Will Smith
[02:55.30]It's a full-time job to be a good dad
[02:57.11]You got so much more stuff than I had
[02:59.42]I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
[03:02.05]101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
[03:04.73]See me-I'm
[03:06.11]Tryin to pretend I know
[03:07.11]On my PC where that CD go
[03:09.55]But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone
[03:12.42]Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong
[03:15.17]But just in case
[03:15.92]It's my place
[03:16.73]To impart
[03:17.42]One day some girl's gonna break your heart
[03:19.80]And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
[03:22.36]Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
[03:25.42]Throughout life people will make you mad
[03:27.92]Disrespect you and treat you bad
[03:30.55]Let God deal with the things they do
[03:32.61]Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
[03:35.54]Always tell the truth, say your prayers
[03:37.79]Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
[03:40.73]You're living proof that dreams do come true
[03:42.92]I love you and I'm here for you
[03:44.73]Chorus to fade
