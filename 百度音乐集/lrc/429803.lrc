[00:33.58]I was dreamin' when I wrote this
[00:35.64]Forgive me if it goes astray
[00:41.60]But when I woke up this mornin'
[00:43.79]Could have sworn it was judgment day
[00:50.10]The sky was all purple
[00:51.71]There were people runnin' everywhere
[00:57.32]Tryin' to run from the destruction
[01:00.16]You know I didn't even care
[01:04.74]They say two thousand zero, zero, party over
[01:08.79]Oops, out of time!
[01:13.44]So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!
[01:22.31]I was dreamin' when I wrote this
[01:23.99]So sue me if I go too fast
[01:29.87]But life is just a party
[01:31.94]And parties weren't meant to last
[01:37.98]War is all around us
[01:39.85]My mind says prepare to fight
[01:46.51]So if I gotta die
[01:47.49]I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
[01:53.42]They say two thousand zero, zero, party over
[01:56.57]Oops, out of time!
[02:01.23]So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!
[02:17.40]1999!
[02:18.73]If you didn't come to party
[02:20.37]Don't bother knockin' on my door
[02:27.03]I got a lion in my pocket
[02:28.78]And baby, he's ready to roar
[02:34.44]Yeah, everybody's got a bomb
[02:36.70]We could all die any day
[02:41.93]But before I'll let that happen
[02:44.58]I'll dance my life away
[02:49.56]They say two thousand zero, zero, party over
[02:53.58]Oops, out of time! (We're runnin' outta time)
[02:58.15]So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!
[03:05.17]Say, say
[03:07.04]Two thousand zero, zero, party over
[03:09.62]Oops, out of time!
[03:13.56]So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!
[03:21.26]Alright, it's 1999!
[03:24.89]You say it, 1999!
[03:29.77]1999!
