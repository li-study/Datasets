[00:13.39]I have a dream
[00:17.86]a song to sing
[00:22.52]to help me cope
[00:27.05]with anything
[00:32.34]if you see the wonder
[00:36.63]of a fairy tale
[00:41.47]you can take the future
[00:46.06]even if you fail
[00:50.47]I believe in angels
[00:55.16]something good in everything I see
[00:59.78]I believe in angels
[01:04.31]when I know the time is right for me
[01:08.26]I’ll cross the stream
[01:12.80]I have a dream

[01:21.92]a fantasy
[01:26.52]to help me through
[01:31.08]reality
[01:36.27]and my destination
[01:40.84]makes it worth the while
[01:45.42]pushing through the darkness
[01:49.60]still another mile
