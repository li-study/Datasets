[00:14.51]Do you remember me?
[00:19.19]I sat upon your knee;
[00:22.89]I wrote to you
[00:25.15]With childhood fantasies.
[00:30.36]Well, I'm all grown-up now,
[00:34.80]And still need help somehow.
[00:38.62]I'm not a child,
[00:41.03]But my heart still can dream.
[00:46.35]So here's my lifelong wish,
[00:50.98]My grown-up Christmas list.
[00:54.54]Not for myself,
[00:56.64]But for a world in need.
[01:03.42]No more lives torn apart,
[01:09.15]That wars would never start,
[01:13.04]And time would heal all hearts.
[01:19.36]And everyone would have a friend,
[01:25.79]And right would always win,
[01:28.58]And love would never end.
[01:34.01]This is my grown-up Christmas list.
[01:49.67]As children we believed
[01:54.28]The grandest sight to see
[01:58.31]Was something lovely
[02:00.48]Wrapped beneath our tree.
[02:06.11]Well Heaven surely knows
[02:09.97]That packages and bows
[02:13.87]Can never heal
[02:15.74]A hurting human soul.
[02:21.50]No more lives torn apart,
[02:27.76]That wars would never start,
[02:31.51]And time would heal all hearts.
[02:36.89]And everyone would have a friend,
[02:42.84]And right would always win,
[02:46.48]And love would never end.
[02:53.16]This is my grown-up Christmas list.
[03:01.37]What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
[03:08.76]Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth.
[03:30.99]No more lives torn apart,
[03:38.22]That wars would never start,
[03:42.52]And time would heal all hearts.
[03:48.65]And everyone would have a friend,
[03:53.84]And right would always win,
[03:57.05]And love would never end, oh.
[04:03.44]This is my grown-up Christmas list.
[04:11.48]This is my grown-up Christmas list.
