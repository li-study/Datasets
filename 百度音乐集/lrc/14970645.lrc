[00:00.00]Blur - On The Way To The Club
[00:33.62]
[00:35.62]On my way to the club
[00:41.42]I fell down a hole
[00:47.29]All the people there
[00:51.59]Said you come alone
[00:56.96]And I, I just want to be
[01:01.49]darling with you
[01:03.91]The music's made that way
[01:07.66]My eyes aren't blue
[01:10.07]There's nothing I can do
[01:15.19]
[01:17.01]So I stayed in the club
[01:22.72]Just rewarding myself
[01:28.88]Happiness could turn into something else
[01:40.34]And I just wanna be, darling with you
[01:45.45]The music's made that way
[01:49.28]My eyes aren't blue
[01:51.61]There's nothing I can do
[01:57.55]
