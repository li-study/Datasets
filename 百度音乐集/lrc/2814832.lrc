[00:01.54]Cut
[00:04.54]Plumb
[00:08.54]
[00:15.95]I'm not a stranger
[00:20.46]No I am yours
[00:24.71]With crippled anger
[00:27.78]And tears that still drip sore
[00:30.88]
[00:32.73]A fragile flame aged
[00:36.02]Is misery
[00:40.39]And when our hearts meet
[00:43.77]I know you see
[00:46.73]
[00:48.08]I do not want to be afraid
[00:55.28]I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
[01:03.35]I'm tired of feeling so numb
[01:10.63]Relief exists I find it when
[01:16.56]I am cut
[01:20.18]
[01:26.23]I may seem crazy
[01:29.77]Or painfully shy
[01:33.59]And these scars wouldn't be so hidden
[01:37.28]If you would just look me in the eye
[01:41.82]I feel alone here and cold here
[01:45.01]Though I don't want to die
[01:49.45]But the only anesthetic that makes me feel anything kills inside
[01:55.05]
[01:57.20]I do not want to be afraid
[02:04.41]I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
[02:12.74]I'm tired of feeling so numb
[02:19.62]Relief exists I find it when
[02:25.38]I am cut
[02:39.15]Pain
[02:43.31]I am not alone
[02:51.42]I am not alone
[02:59.01]
[03:00.02]I'm not a stranger
[03:02.81]No I am yours
[03:06.86]With crippled anger
[03:10.25]And tears that still drip sore
[03:11.93]
[03:15.00]But I do not want to be afraid
[03:21.93]I do not want to die inside just to breathe in
[03:30.77]I'm tired of feeling so numb
[03:37.09]Relief exists I found it when
[03:42.68]I was cut
[03:46.09]
