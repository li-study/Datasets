[00:10.76](another song)all over again
[00:44.67]You've been alone,
[00:49.11]you've been afraid
[00:54.18]I've been a fool
[00:58.36]In so many ways
[01:00.88]But I would change my life
[01:15.47]If you thought you,
[01:15.54]might try to love me
[01:20.12]So please give me another chance
[01:28.97]To write you another song
[01:33.78]And take back those things I've done
[01:39.22]Cause I'll give you my heart
[01:47.97]If you would let me start all over,
[02:10.11]I'm not a saint
[02:14.84]I'm just a man
[02:19.21]Who had heaven and Earth
[02:23.09]In the palm of his hand
[02:26.09]But I threw it away
[02:34.74]So now I stand here today asking forgiveness and if you could just please
[02:49.62]Give me another chance
[02:54.18]To write you another song
[02:58.88]And take back those thing's I've done
[03:04.59]Cause I'll give you my heart
[03:13.25]If you would let me start all over

[03:39.69]Don't you leave me standing here once again
[03:51.50]Cause I'll give you my life
[03:58.83]Yes I would
[04:00.30]If you would let me try to let me love you
