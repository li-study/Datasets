[00:12]
[00:24]I wish could've tied you up in my shoes
[00:27]Make you feel unpretty too
[00:29]I was told I was beautiful
[00:33]But what does that mean to you
[00:35]Look into the mirror who's inside there
[00:38]The one with the long hair
[00:40]Same old me again today (yeah)
[00:42]
[00:44]My outsides look cool
[00:46]My insides are blue
[00:49]Everytime I think I'm through
[00:52]It's because of you
[00:55]I've tried different ways
[00:57]But it's all the same
[01:00]At the end of the day
[01:03]I have myself to blame
[01:05]I'm just trippin'
[01:06]
[04:33][04:11][03:49][02:44][02:23][01:07]You can buy your hair if it won't grow
[03:52][02:48][02:26][01:10]You can fix your nose if he says so
[04:16][03:54][02:50][02:28][01:12]You can buy all the make up
[04:18][03:57][02:52][02:30][01:15]That MAC can make
[04:20][03:59][02:54][02:33][01:17]But if you can't look inside you
[04:03][02:59][02:37][01:20]Find out who am I to
[04:27][04:05][03:01][02:39][01:23]Be in the position to make me feel
[04:30][04:09][03:04][02:42][01:26]So damn unpretty
[03:15][03:09][01:32]I'll make you feel unpretty too
[01:37]
[01:39]Never insecure until I met you
[01:43]Now I'm bein' stupid
[01:45]I used to be so cute to me
[01:48]Just a little bit skinny
[01:50]Why do I look to all these things
[01:53]To keep you happy
[01:56]Maybe get rid of you
[01:58]And then I'll get back to me (hey)
[02:00]My outsides look cool
[02:03]My insides are blue
[02:05]Everytime I think I'm through
[02:08]It's because of you
[02:11]I've tried different ways
[02:13]But it's all the same
[02:16]At the end of the day
[02:19]I have myself to blame
[02:21]I'm just trippin'
[03:19]
[03:27]Oh oh oh oh oh
[03:32]Oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
[03:38]Oh oh oh oh oh
[03:44]Oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
