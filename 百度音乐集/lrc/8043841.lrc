[00:04.10]The Long Goodbye
[00:08.25]Ronan Keating
[00:12.00]
[00:28.89]I know they say if you love somebody
[00:33.83]You should set them free (so they say)
[00:37.36]But it sure is hard to do
[00:40.85]Yeah, it sure is hard to do
[00:43.42]And I know they say if they don't come back again
[00:47.56]Then it's meant to be ( so they say)
[00:50.90]But those words ain't pulling me through
[00:54.51]Cos I'm still in love with you
[00:57.24]I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
[01:03.50]But it's just you and me going through the mill
[01:08.38](climbin' up a hill)
[01:10.98]This is the long goodbye
[01:14.68]Somebody tell me why
[01:17.87]Two lovers in love can't make it
[01:21.27]Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
[01:24.61]No matter how hard I try
[01:28.67]You're gonna make me cry
[01:31.64]Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
[01:35.06]All that's happening here is a long goodbye
[01:38.70]
[01:51.68]Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
[01:56.66]Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
[02:00.29]and I know without a doubt
[02:03.60]I turned it inside out
[02:06.23]And if we walked away
[02:08.89]would make more sense (only self defense)
[02:12.29]But it tears me up inside
[02:17.23]Just to think we still could try
[02:19.79]How long must we keep riding on a carousel
[02:26.85]Going round and round and never getting anywhere?
[02:31.17](on a wing and prayer)
[02:33.72]This is the long goodbye
[02:37.41]Somebody tell me why
[02:40.57]Two lovers in love can't make it
[02:43.91]Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
[02:47.40]No matter how hard I try
[02:51.42]You're gonna make me cry
[02:54.39]Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
[02:57.83]All that's happening here is a long goodbye
[03:01.69]
[03:15.01]This is the long goodbye
[03:18.74]Somebody tell me why
[03:21.93]Two lovers in love can't make it
[03:25.44]Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
[03:28.83]No matter how hard I try
[03:32.77]You're gonna make me cry
[03:35.32]Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
[03:39.02]All that's happening here is a long goodbye
[03:44.54]
[03:52.16]Are you ever coming back again
[03:59.13]Are you ever coming back again
[04:06.36]Are you ever coming back again（back again..）
