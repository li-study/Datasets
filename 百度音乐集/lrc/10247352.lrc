[00:01.51]YOU AND I
[00:04.79]make by danielvon
[00:08.08]High above the mountains, far across the sea
[00:15.24]I can hear your voice calling out to me
[00:23.53]Brighter than the sun and darker than the night
[00:30.86]I can see your love shining like a light
[00:38.56]And on and on this earth spins like a carousel
[00:46.43]If I could travel across the world
[00:50.65]The secrets I would tell
[00:57.69]Chorus:
[00:58.56]You and I
[01:02.23]Were meant to fly
[01:06.29]Higher than the clouds
[01:08.58]We’ll sail across the sky
[01:13.75]So come with me
[01:17.39]And you will feel
[01:21.14]That we’re soaring
[01:25.01]That we’re floating up so high
[01:29.36]‘Cause you and I were meant to fly
[01:41.37]Sailing like a bird high on the wings of love
[01:48.48]Take me higher than all the stars above
[01:56.40]I’m burning, yearning
[01:58.69]Gently turning round and round
[02:04.24]I’m always rising up I never
[02:08.57]Want to come back down
[02:15.78]Chorus:
[02:16.38]You and I
[02:19.93]Were meant to fly
[02:24.04]Higher than the clouds
[02:26.73]We’ll sail across the sky
[02:31.38]So come with me
[02:35.01]And you will feel
[02:39.14]That we’re soaring
[02:42.69]That we’re floating up so high
[02:47.21]‘Cause you and I were meant to fly
[03:11.75]Chorus:
[03:12.73]You and I
[03:16.27]Were meant to fly
[03:20.28]Higher than the clouds
[03:24.20]We’ll sail across the sky
[03:27.56]So come with me
[03:31.54]And you will feel
[03:35.22]That we’re soaring
[03:38.88]That we’re floating up so high
[03:43.60]‘Cause you and I were meant to fly
[03:56.00]‘Cause you and I were meant to fly
