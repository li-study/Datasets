[00:00.70]Lady Antebellum - Hello World
[00:01.94]
[00:18.69]Traffic crawls, cell phone calls
[00:25.85]Talk radio screams at me through my turning window
[00:33.39]I see a little girl, rust-red minivan
[00:42.30]She's got chocolate on her face
[00:47.52]Got little hands and she waves at me...
[00:54.78]Yeah she smiles at me.
[00:57.97]
[00:59.47]Hello world, how ya been?
[01:07.29]Good to see you my old friend.
[01:16.08]Sometimes I feel as cold as steel,
[01:25.05]Broken like I'm never gonna heal.
[01:33.81]I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl.
[01:42.14]Hello world.
[01:48.94]
[01:53.70]Every day I drive by a little white church
[02:00.33]It's got these little white crosses
[02:04.50]like angels in the yard.
[02:08.51]Maybe I should stop on in, say a prayer
[02:18.53]Maybe talk to God like He is there.
[02:25.93]Oh, I know He is there, yeah I know He is there.
[02:33.22]
[02:34.46]Well, hello world, how ya been?
[02:42.83]Good to see you my old friend.
[02:51.88]Sometimes I feel as cold as steel
[03:00.72]And broken like I'm never gonna heal.
[03:08.89]I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurled.
[03:17.55]Hello world.
[03:20.09]
[03:22.33]Sometimes I forget what living's for
[03:26.90]And I hear my life through my front door.
[03:31.46]And I'll be there, oh I'm home again.
[03:41.38]I see my wife, little boy, little girl...
[03:50.09]Hello world. Hello world.
[04:03.34]
[04:08.29]All the empty disappears I remember why I'm here.
[04:16.47]Just surrender and believe, I fall down on my knees.
[04:24.27]Well hello world, hello world, hello world.
[04:41.68]
