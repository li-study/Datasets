[00:16.55]She said it wasn′t cold
[00:20.30]She left her coat at home that day
[00:23.11]She wore canvas shoes
[00:26.24]White canvas shoes
[00:29.61]Around her neck
[00:31.86]She wore a silver necklace
[00:35.55]It was given to me by my father， she said
[00:38.61]It was given to me
[00:41.67]She took the back way home
[00:44.74]Passed the lights and the summer hill
[00:47.99]Turned left onto the north strand
[00:51.24]And on， and towards the sea
[00:54.49]He said he was an artist
[00:57.24]But he really painted billboards
[01:00.23]In large capital letters
[01:04.05]Large capital letters
[01:06.86]He was telling jokes
[01:09.61]Nobody else would listen to him
[01:31.74]I saw you that day
[01:34.55]Your lips were cherry red
[01:37.49]Your legs were crossed
[01:38.76]Your arms wide open
[01:43.95]Your hair was coloured gold
[01:46.89]Like a field of corn
[01:49.82]You were blown by the wind
[01:53.01]You were blown by the wind
[02:14.26]Walk， walk， walk...to the water
[02:21.14]Walk with me a while
[02:26.83]Walk， walk， walk...to the roadside
[02:32.89]Walk me in the light
[02:39.76]A room in the wild town
[02:42.89]Sea facing views
[02:45.57]A man with a suitcase
[02:48.82]Full of things he doesn′t need
[02:51.95]I′m looking through your window
[02:55.13]I′m walking through your doorway
[02:58.01]I′m on the outside
[03:00.51]Let me in
[03:03.14]Let me love you
[03:09.08]Let me love you
[03:15.20]Let me...
[03:41.07]Walk， walk， walk...to the water
[03:47.26]Walk with me...yeah
[03:53.57]Walk， walk， walk...to the roadside
[03:59.32]Walk with me again
