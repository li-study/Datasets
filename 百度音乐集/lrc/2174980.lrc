[00:08.03]Time is like a dream
[00:13.94]And now for a time you are mine
[00:20.10]Let's hold fast to the dream
[00:25.89]That tastes and sparkles like wine
[01:59.36][00:31.70]Who knows if it's real or just something
[02:05.56][00:39.93]We're both dreaming of
[02:22.15][02:09.89][00:44.10]What seem like an interlude now
[02:27.95][02:15.75][00:49.53]Could be the beginning of love
[00:57.82]Loving you is a world that's strange
[01:03.91]So much more than my heart can hold
[01:09.12]Loving you make the whole world change
[01:15.74]Loving you I could not grow old
[01:21.28]No, nobody knows
[01:26.39]when love will end
[01:28.65]So till then sweet friend
[01:34.85](Time is like a dream)
[01:39.77](And now for a time you are mine)
[01:46.35](Let's hold fast to the dream)
[01:51.96](That tastes and sparkles like wine)
