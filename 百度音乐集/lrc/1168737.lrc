[00:33.72]Annie,
[00:35.30]I saw your name on the bright lights
[00:37.69]I thought I saw your photograph
[00:40.18]and its such a laugh, in a magazine
[00:43.20]Did it all come true?
[00:46.56]then Annie, you were made for the big time
[00:48.95]They said you were a star to be
[00:51.12]In the NME
[00:52.39]But the walls came tumbling down down
[00:58.11]they go down on me
[01:02.49]\'Cause Annie you\'re a star
[01:05.24]You\'re just not going very far
[01:08.39]And all the world will know your name
[01:11.75]And you\'ll be famous as you are
[01:16.33]\'Cause I\'ll sing for you
[01:31.15]Annie,
[01:32.64]would it be nice to be recognized?
[01:35.77]Did you practise your autograph?
[01:37.72]But then no one\'s asked
[01:39.17]And it\'s such a shame
[01:40.51]Your dreams are crumbling
[01:42.75]Annie,
[01:44.26]why aren\'t you big in limelight?
[01:47.16]\'Cause I thought that you said you\'d be
[01:49.46]A celebrity several years ago
[01:52.32]But it all came tumbling down down,
[01:55.85]they go down on me
[02:00.04]\'Cause Annie you\'re a star
[02:03.20]You\'re just not going very far
[02:06.56]And all the world will know your name
[02:09.95]And you\'ll be famous as you are
[02:14.46]\'Cause I\'ll sing for you
[02:33.61]Annie you\'re a star
[02:36.85]You\'re just not going very far
[02:40.36]And all the world will know your name
[02:43.83]And you\'ll be famous as you are
[02:48.36]\'Cause I\'ll sing for you
[02:51.50]Annie you\'re a star
[02:53.92]You\'re just not going very far
