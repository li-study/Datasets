[00:00.00]Lark in the clear air
[00:00.66]Dear thoughts are my mind
[00:08.40]and my soul it soars enchanted,
[00:15.34]As I hear the sweet lark sing
[00:21.79]in the clear air of the day,
[00:30.00]For a tender beaming
[00:32.66]smile to my hope has been granted,
[00:42.05]And tomorrow
[00:44.86]he shall hear all my fond heart
[00:51.41]longs to say.
[00:57.27]I will tell him all my love ,
[01:03.65]all my soul's pure adoration,
[01:10.01]And I know he will hear my voice
[01:16.65]and he will not answer me nay,
[01:24.03]It is this that gives my soul
[01:28.95]all it's joyous elation,
[01:35.41]As I hear the sweet lark sing
[01:41.91]in the clear air of the day.
[01:50.11]It is this that gives my soul
[01:57.37]all it's joyous elation,
[02:04.09]As I hear the sweet lark sing
[02:10.43]in the clear air of the day.
