[00:04.60]Misty
[00:07.69]
[00:22.79]Look at me
[00:27.66]I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
[00:35.49]And I feel like I'm hanging to a cloud
[00:39.77]I can't understand
[00:43.26]I get misty
[00:45.93]Just holding your hand
[00:49.48]
[00:54.02]Walk my way
[00:58.49]And a thousand violins begin to play
[01:06.67]Or it might be the sound of your hello
[01:11.35]That music I hear
[01:14.78]I get misty
[01:18.30]The moment you're near
[01:20.86]
[01:24.41]You can say that you're leading me on
[01:31.34]But it's just what I want you to do
[01:39.98]Don't you know just how hopelessly I'm drawn
[01:47.25]That's why I'm following you
[01:53.08]
[01:56.64]On my own
[02:01.55]When I wander through this wonderland alone
[02:09.37]Never knowing my right foot from my left
[02:13.44]My hat from my glove
[02:17.33]I am too Misty
[02:21.06]And too much in love
[02:24.77]
[02:28.27]I am just too Misty
[02:34.40]And too much in love
[02:49.86]
