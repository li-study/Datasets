[00:06.07]Tit:Awake
[00:08.23]Alb:Awake
[00:16.56]With every appearance by you, blinding my eyes,
[00:22.35]I can hardly remember the last time I felt like I do.
[00:27.66]You\'re an angel disguised.
[00:31.89]And you\'re lying real still,
[00:34.17]but your heart beat is fast just like mine.
[00:40.31]And the movie\'s long over,
[00:42.15]that\'s three that have passed, one more\'s fine.
[00:49.07]Will you stay awake for me?
[00:54.80]I don\'t wanna miss anything
[00:58.91]I don\'t wanna miss anything
[01:04.51]I will share the air I breathe,
[01:10.74]I\'ll give you my heart on a string,
[01:14.61]I just don\'t wanna miss anything.
[01:37.34]I\'m trying real hard not to shake. I\'m biting my tongue,
[01:43.89]but I\'m feeling alive and with every breathe that I take,
[01:48.87]I feel like I\'ve won. You\'re my key to survival.
[01:53.89]And if it\'s a hero you want,
[01:56.63]I can save you. Just stay here.
[02:01.63]Your whispers are priceless.
[02:04.19]Your breathe, it is dear. So please stay near.
[02:09.50]Will you stay awake for me?
[02:16.83]I don\'t wanna miss anything
[02:20.38]I don\'t wanna miss anything
[02:25.84]I will share the air I breathe,
[02:32.58]I\'ll give you my heart on a string,
[02:36.01]I just don\'t wanna miss anything.
[02:43.71]Say my name. I just want to hear you.
[02:51.79]Say my name. So I know it\'s true.
[02:58.36]You\'re changing me. You\'re changing me.
[03:03.15]You showed me how to live.
[03:06.41]So just say. So just say,
[03:14.69]That you\'ll stay awake for me.
[03:21.26]I don\'t wanna miss anything.
[03:25.48]Your whispers are priceless.
[03:25.49]I don\'t wanna miss anything.
[03:31.33]I will share the air I breathe,
[03:38.26]I\'ll give you my heart on a string,
[03:43.59]I just don\'t wanna miss anything
