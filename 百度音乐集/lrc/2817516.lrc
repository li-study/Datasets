[00:08.38][03:50.82][03:55.36]
[00:09.82](How would it be?)
[00:18.53]What have I done?
[00:22.03][01:32.80]What if it's too late now?
[00:25.55]Did I do all I could, did I?
[00:29.17]Did I make it good, did I?
[00:32.52][01:43.32]Somehow it doesn't feel right
[00:36.03][01:46.96]Is it really all over?
[00:39.73]Did I think it through, did I?
[00:43.12]What if all I want is you?
[00:46.01][01:00.38][01:56.95][02:10.98][02:53.30][03:07.70][03:21.55][03:36.10]And now
[00:47.61][01:58.32][02:55.24][03:23.60]I won't see you again
[00:51.50][02:02.13][02:58.73][03:27.20]The moment was there but we lost it
[00:55.15][02:05.96][03:02.52][03:30.86]Time changed it all
[00:56.35][02:07.22][03:03.86][03:32.00]And we let it
[00:58.53][02:09.38][03:06.12][03:34.34]We let it happen
[01:02.06][02:12.87][03:09.48][03:37.82]I wonder how it would be
[01:05.68][02:16.42][03:13.10][03:41.38]If things stayed the same and we liked it
[01:09.25][02:20.00][03:16.59][03:44.97]The end of a search 'cos we found it
[01:13.45][01:16.89][01:20.38][01:24.02][02:24.19][02:27.60][02:31.14][02:34.71][03:49.22]How would it be?
[01:29.36]What have we done?
[01:36.24]Was it always like this, was it?
[01:39.82]Was it something we missed, was it?
[01:50.44]Was it all it could be, was it?
[01:53.93]Did I give you the best of me?
