[00:16.15]Livin' in the city
[00:17.69]Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on
[00:23.55]But the job demands that you make new plans
[00:27.81]Before your big chance is gone
[00:33.33]You get a house in the hills
[00:35.29]You're payin' everyone's bills
[00:37.50]And they tell you that you're gonna go far
[00:41.23]But in the back of my mind
[00:43.22]I hear it time after time
[00:45.66]Is that who you really are
[02:30.54][01:58.65][00:49.05]Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
[02:34.99][02:03.16][00:53.56]But your mind's on Tennessee
[02:38.78][02:06.88][00:57.28]Lookin' back, I can remember the time
[02:43.02][02:11.12][01:01.55]When I sang my songs for free
[02:46.46][02:14.68][01:05.04]Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
[02:50.97][02:19.07][01:09.46]Take a look at everything you own
[02:55.14][02:23.35][01:13.86]But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home
[01:20.10]
[01:25.98]Talkin' on the telephone
[01:27.85]Settin' up another day of people to meet
[01:33.16]You've gotta do what's right
[01:35.65]You've spend the night
[01:37.92]Stayin' in touch with the street
[01:43.17]When you're surrounded by friends
[01:45.15]They say the fun never ends
[01:47.27]But I guess I'll never figure it out
[01:50.92]'Cause in the back of my mind
[01:52.96]I hear it time after time
[01:55.40]Is this what it's all about
