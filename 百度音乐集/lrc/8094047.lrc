[00:08.70]
[00:16.20]I'm looking outside of my window
[00:19.76]the view that I see
[00:22.24]is a child and mama
[00:25.90]and the child is begging for money

[00:31.66]the woman is blind
[00:33.85]is she so broken
[00:35.29]the kid's dealing crime

[01:13.79]'cause this man he's asking for money

[02:02.33]
[02:02.61]One day I'm going to have lots of money
[02:08.83]but I'll have to give it up for this rich society
[02:15.47]oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future
[02:24.47]'cause you'll just get it back
[02:29.31]from the little blind woman
[02:31.63]with the kid on the corner
[02:34.30]and the people full over, doin' crack
[02:39.16]yea yea yea yea yea yea yea

[03:00.51]and it's burning down
[03:04.34]and it's called the US of A
[03:06.83]
[03:16.84]I'm walking outside on a sunny day
[03:20.60]with no one around
[03:23.26]and I wonder what's wrong
[03:26.89]then I hear this loud piercing siren
[03:31.42]oh my God the bomb has just dropped
[03:35.06]and everybody climbed right on top screaming
[03:39.77]what A wonderful country
