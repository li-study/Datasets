[00:12.00]
[00:12.83]Some kind of magic
[00:18.13]Happens late at night
[00:23.71]When the moon smiles down on me
[00:29.28]And bathes me in it's light
[00:31.87]
[00:34.49]I fell asleep beneath you
[00:40.40]In the tall blades of grass
[00:46.05]When I woke the world was new
[00:51.49]I never had to ask
[00:54.51]
[00:57.54]It's a brand new day
[01:01.25]The sun is shinning
[01:03.04]It's a brand new day
[01:08.27]For the first time
[01:10.27]In such a long long time
[01:14.19]I know
[01:19.22]I'll be ok
[01:20.69]
[01:32.62]Most kind of stories
[01:37.53]Save the best part for last
[01:43.57]Most stories have a hero who finds
[01:48.76]You make your past your past
[01:54.00]Ya you make your past your past
[01:57.30]
[02:00.15]It's a brand new day
[02:04.08]The sun is shinning
[02:05.66]It's a brand new day
[02:10.88]For the first time
[02:12.99]In such a long long time
[02:16.98]I know
[02:22.05]I'll be ok
[02:23.62]
[02:35.91]This cycle never ends
[02:41.87]Gotta fall in order to mend
[02:47.20]
[02:51.81]And it's a brand new day
[02:57.60]It's a brand new day
[03:02.88]For the first time
[03:04.77]In such a long long time
[03:08.64]I know
[03:13.72]I'll be ok
