[00:02.00]Sarah McLachlan - Fear
[00:19.00]
[00:20.56]Morning smiles
[00:25.60]like the face of a newborn child
[00:33.19]innocent unknowing
[00:41.66]Winter's end
[00:45.67]promises of a long lost friend
[00:53.05]speaks to me of comfort
[00:58.11]but I fear
[01:02.98]I have nothing to give
[01:07.60]I have so much to lose
[01:12.93]here in this lonely place
[01:16.47]tangled up in our embrace
[01:20.59]there's nothing I'd like
[01:25.23]better than to fall
[01:31.00]but I fear I have nothing to give
[01:46.09]
[01:57.04]Wind in time
[02:01.65]rapes the flower trembling on the vine
[02:10.22]nothing yields to shelter it
[02:17.61]from above
[02:23.05]they say temptation will destroy our love
[02:29.81]the never ending hunger
[02:37.60]but I fear
[02:40.01]I have nothing to give
[02:44.90]I have so much to lose
[02:50.00]here in this lonely place
[02:52.88]tangled up in our embrace
[02:57.28]there's nothing I'd like
[03:01.61]better than to fall
[03:08.02]but I fear
[03:10.71]I have nothing to give
[03:16.35]I have so much to lose
[03:20.76]I have nothing to give
[03:25.97]We have so much to lose.
