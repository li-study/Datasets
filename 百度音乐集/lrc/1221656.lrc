[00:14.00]
[00:22.00]I see you movin around in the light
[00:27.00]been watching you for a while
[00:32.00]I don't know what's inside of your mind
[00:36.00]but it's lightning when I look in your eyes
[00:42.00]I never trusted in miracles
[00:47.00]I never looked in the stars
[00:52.00]but when I see an angel on earth
[00:56.00]that makes my heart sing
[00:59.00]I believe in anything
[01:02.00]'cos there's magic in the way you walk
[01:07.00]something special in the way you talk
[01:12.00]this is real this is true
[01:14.00]I've got the faith in you
[01:29.00][01:18.00]la la la la...la la la
[01:32.00][01:21.00]every little thing you do
[01:36.00][01:25.00]becomes magic
[01:46.00]You gotta stop this feeling of burning desire
[01:52.00]from slowly driving me mad
[01:57.00]so bring me in from the cold with your love
[02:01.00]I'm never gonna stop
[02:04.00]I'm never gonna give you up
[02:07.00]'cos there's magic in the way you walk
[02:12.00]something special in the way you talk
[02:17.00]this is real this is true
[02:19.00]I've got the faith in you
[03:42.00][03:32.00][03:22.00][02:52.00][02:43.00][02:32.00][02:22.00]la la la la...la la la
[03:46.00][03:36.00][03:26.00][03:01.00][02:56.00][02:46.00][02:36.00][02:26.00]every little thing you do
[03:53.00][03:50.00][03:40.00][03:30.00][03:05.00][02:40.00][02:30.00]becomes magic
