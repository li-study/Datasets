[00:26.34]I don't know why it is
[00:30.66]But there doesn't have to be a reason anywhere

[01:13.91]Inspires me without a sound
[01:17.14]She touches me and I get turned around
[01:25.28]She's got a way of showin'
[01:29.85]How I make her feel
[01:34.31]And I find the strength to keep on goin'

[01:44.87]And ev'rywhere she goes a million
