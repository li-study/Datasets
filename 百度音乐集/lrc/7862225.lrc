[00:08.30]An empty street,an empty house,a hole inside my heart
[00:15.00]I'm all alone and the rooms are getting smaller
[00:21.70]I wonder how,I wonder why,I wonder where they are
[00:28.30]The days we had,the songs we sang together
[00:32.95]Oh yeah
[00:34.90]And oh my love,I'm holding on forever
[00:41.80]Reaching for a love that seems so far
[00:47.55]So I say a little prayer
[00:50.80]And hope my dreams will take me there
[00:54.25]Where the skies are blue to see you once again,my love
[01:00.90]Over seas and coast to coast
[01:04.15]To find a place I love the most
[01:07.65]Where the fields are green to see you once again
[01:14.10]My love
[01:16.60]X   Music   X
[01:18.35]I try to read,I go to work,I'm laughing with my friends
[01:24.90]But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking
[01:29.75]Oh no
[01:31.75]I wonder how,I wonder why,I wonder where they are
[01:38.25]The days we had,the songs we sang together
[01:43.00]Oh yeah
[01:44.90]And oh my love,I'm holding on forever
[01:51.75]Reaching for a love that seems so far
[01:57.55]So I say a little prayer
[02:00.80]And hope my dreams will take me there
[02:04.20]Where the skies are blue to see you once again,my love
[02:10.85]Over seas and coast to coast
[02:14.05]To find a place I love the most
[02:17.55]Where the fields are green to see you once again
[02:23.35]To hold you in my arms
[02:26.60]To promise you my love
[02:29.90]To tell you from the heart
[02:33.30]You're all I'm thinking of
[02:37.85]X   Music   X
[02:44.85]I'm reaching for a love that seems so far
[02:50.25]So I say a little prayer
[02:54.10]And hope my dreams will take me there
[02:57.50]Where the skies are blue to see you once again,my love
[03:04.20]Over seas and coast to coast
[03:07.45]To find a place I love the most
[03:10.80]Where the fields are green to see you once again,my love
[03:18.30]Say a little prayer
[03:20.85]Dreams will take me there
[03:24.15]Where the skies are blue to see you once again
[03:30.85]Over seas and coast to coast
[03:34.15]To find a place I love the most
[03:37.55]Where the fields are green to see you once again
[03:44.15]My love
