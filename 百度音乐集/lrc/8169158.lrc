[00:00.00]Beck - Missing
[00:28.11]
[00:32.11]I prayed heaven today
[00:37.90]Would bring its hammer down on me
[00:42.20]And pound you out of my head
[00:48.11]I can't think with you in it
[00:52.43]
[01:03.54]I'd drag all that I owned
[01:08.81]Down the dirt road to find you
[01:13.90]And my shoes, worn-out and used
[01:19.73]They can't take me much farther
[01:24.66]Ohhh
[01:34.15]
[01:35.02]Something always takes the place of missing pieces
[01:42.78]You can take and put together even though
[01:49.91]You know there's something missing
[01:54.66]
[01:55.91]The sun burned a hole in my roof
[02:01.59]I can't seem to fix it
[02:06.53]And I hope rain doesn't come
[02:12.45]Wash me down the gutter
[02:16.93]
[02:17.30]Something always takes the place of missing pieces
[02:24.93]You can take and put together even though
[02:32.04]You know there's something missing
[02:36.65]
[02:38.27]She rides in a car
[02:39.29]Like a queen on a card
[02:40.57]And the guns of her mind
[02:41.92]Aim a line straight at mine
[02:43.35]To a heart that is broke
[02:44.55]Tried to feel but got choked
[02:45.94]In the smoke of a desert
[02:47.32]A beach with no treasure
[02:48.78]A night that seems blue
[02:49.83]Feed the aching in you
[02:51.24]And the background birds
[02:52.33]Take a flight from the earth
[02:53.86]A bonfire burns
[02:54.95]And the night current turns
[02:56.39]On a lifeboat floating
[02:57.84]Down a river of sleep
[02:59.14]Can't see her hollow eyes
[03:01.96]Walking along with my boots full of rocks
[03:04.28]Can't believe these tears of mine
[03:07.21]I give 'em to you to keep away in a box
[03:09.57]
[03:52.14]Something always takes the place of missing pieces
[03:59.66]You can take and put together even though
[04:06.79]You know there's something missing
[04:11.43]
[04:13.14]Something always missing
[04:16.74]Always someone missing something
[04:23.59]Something always missing
[04:27.22]Always someone missing something
[04:34.05]Something always missing
[04:37.71]Always someone missing something
[04:44.69]Something always missing
[04:48.46]Always someone missing something
[04:53.48]
