[00:00.39]I hear what you're not saying
[00:05.10]It's driving me crazy
[00:08.22]It's like we stopped breathing in this room
[00:14.40]We're both the last to be leaving
[00:17.96]I know what you're thinking
[00:21.46]I wish you'd make your move
[00:25.07]It's much too quiet in here
[00:31.06]I wanna disapear
[00:34.24]I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
[00:39.41]It's too quiet in here
[00:43.77]Make it all go away
[00:46.99]Why can't we break this silence finally
[00:51.83]
[00:52.21]It's like you know where I'm going

[00:58.92]And I never invite you inside
[01:05.05]I see what you're not showing
[01:09.15]I got you alone but
[01:12.43]the air is so thin it's weird

[01:30.62]It's too quiet in here
[01:34.90]Make it all go away
[01:38.10]Why can't we break this silence finally
[01:42.75]
[01:43.42]Don't stop don't stop
[01:45.23]Telling me goodnight
[01:46.73]Just moments you'll kiss me tonight
[01:49.24]What's taking so long
[01:52.51]Don't tell me you're not gonna try
[01:55.64]Cuz it's just building in my mind
[01:58.89]I wanna scream and I know why
[02:05.27]It's much too quiet in here
[02:09.63]I wanna disapear
[02:12.88]I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
[02:17.94]It's too quiet in here
[02:22.46]Make it all go away
[02:25.63]Why can't we break this silence finally
