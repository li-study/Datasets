[00:11.25]Enchanted, enchanted
[00:20.01]This magical place that we've found
[00:24.44]No one here but us and the sound
[00:28.81]Of the stars and the night owls
[00:33.44]Your breath and the rolling clouds
[00:39.32]Enchanted, I am, by you
[00:47.38]Now love has come to me
[00:51.82]And set apart thee
[00:56.38]From all of the maddening crowds
[01:01.13]The orchard is leaning her bows
[01:05.51]To hear our laughter
[01:09.95]And we roll in the arder
[01:14.64]Enchanted, i am, by you
