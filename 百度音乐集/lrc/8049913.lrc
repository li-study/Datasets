[00:01.67]Warrior
[00:02.09]
[00:05.05]Your words fall out like a rain from a cloud
[00:10.80]But they feel like stones
[00:14.40]They cut me open
[00:18.40]Every promise rips me apart
[00:24.10]Cause in the end
[00:27.30]You always break them
[00:30.35]Do you know what it feels like
[00:32.35]To feel so unwanted
[00:33.80]You keep thinking you deserve the pain
[00:37.10]When you're loving someone
[00:38.60]Who knows when your heart breaks
[00:42.20]And isn't going to change
[00:43.70]I gotta be a warrior
[00:46.70]In my head, in my heart
[00:50.10]I gotta be a warrior
[00:53.00]Find the strength in these stars
[00:57.00]It's time to turn around
[00:58.60]It's time to think of me
[01:00.20]Gotta stand up and fight for what I believe
[01:03.00]A warrior, a warrior
[01:10.30]Everytime you clawed your way back in
[01:16.00]I crushed myself
[01:19.10]Like I was worthless
[01:23.40]You used to crawling under my skin
[01:28.90]But now you don't even scratch the surface
[01:35.10]Do you know what it feels like
[01:37.00]To feel so unwanted
[01:38.60]You keep thinking you're the one to blame
[01:41.80]When you're loving someone
[01:43.50]Who knows when your heart breaks
[01:45.50]Somethings gotta change
[01:48.60]I gotta be a warrior
[01:51.40]In my head, in my heart
[01:54.90]I gotta be a warrior
[01:57.80]Find the strength in these stars
[02:01.90]It's time to turn around
[02:03.50]It's time to think of me
[02:05.00]Gotta stand up and fight for what I believe
[02:07.80]A warrior, a warrior
[02:14.50]And I know I'm strong enough to make it
[02:17.70]Nothing in the world could bring me down
[02:21.10]You can try your words
[02:22.40]But I won't shake I'll stand my ground
[02:27.40]I gotta be a warrior
[02:30.40]In my head, in my heart
[02:33.90]I gotta be a warrior
[02:36.80]Find the strength in these stars
[02:40.80]It's time to turn around
[02:42.30]It's time to think of me
[02:43.90]Gotta stand up and fight for what I believe
[02:46.80]A warrior, a warrior
[02:53.40]I gotta be a warrior
[02:56.20]In my head, in my heart
[02:59.80]I gotta be a warrior
[03:02.60]Find the strength in these stars
[03:06.70]It's time to turn around
[03:08.50]It's time to think of me
[03:09.90]Gotta stand up and fight for what I believe
[03:12.70]A warrior, a warrior
