[00:13.23]It's the way she fills my senses
[00:19.27]It's the perfume that she wears
[00:25.35]I feel I'm losing my defences
[00:31.41]To the colour of her hair
[00:35.83]And every little piece of her is right
[00:41.77]Just thinking about her
[00:45.29]Takes me through the night
[00:49.82]Every time we meet
[00:52.67]The picture is complete
[00:55.82]Every time we touch
[00:58.62]The feeling is too much
[01:01.48]She's all I ever need
[01:04.61]To fall in love again
[01:07.69]I knew it from the very start
[01:13.38]She's the puzzle of my heart
[01:22.20]It's the way she's always smiling
[01:27.83]That makes me think she never cries
[01:33.73]I feel I'm losing my defences
[01:40.12]To the colour of her eyes
[01:44.89]And every little piece of her is right
[01:52.82]Every time we meet
[01:55.69]The picture is complete
[01:58.72]Every time we touch
[02:01.73]The feeling is too much
[02:04.51]She's all I ever need
[02:07.69]To fall in love again
[02:10.62]I knew it from the very start
[02:16.41]She's the puzzle of my heart
[02:20.93]Like a miracle she's meant to be
[02:26.94]She became the light inside of me
[02:33.13]And I can feel her like a memory
[02:35.89]From long  ago
[02:40.83]Every time we meet
[02:43.72]The picture is complete
[02:46.81]Every time we touch
[02:49.73]The feeling is too much
[02:53.12]Every time we meet
[02:55.93]The picture is complete
[02:58.89]Every time we touch
[03:01.93]The feeling is too much
[03:04.69]She's all I ever need
[03:07.83]To fall in love again
[03:10.81]I knew it from the very start
[03:19.64]She's the puzzle of my heart
