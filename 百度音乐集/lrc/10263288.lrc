[00:01.59]This Masquerade
[00:02.17]Carpenters
[00:03.00]
[00:24.10]Are we really happy with this lonely game we play,
[00:32.74]Looking for the right words to say?
[00:40.59]Searching but not finding  understanding anyway,
[00:48.60]We're lost in this masquerade.
[00:58.25]Both afraid to say we're just too far away
[01:06.27]From being close together from the start.
[01:14.86]We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way
[01:23.26]We're lost inside this lonely game we play.
[01:32.52]Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes,
[01:41.53]And no matter how hard I try
[01:49.17]To understand the reason why we carry on this way
[01:57.34]We're lost in this masquerade.
[02:04.50]
[03:01.60]We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way
[03:09.76]We're lost inside this lonely game we play.
[03:18.70]Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes,
[03:27.21]And no matter how hard I try
[03:35.34]To understand the reason why we carry on this way
[03:43.54]We're lost in this masquerade.
[03:52.57]We're lost in a masquerade.
[04:03.04]
[04:08.09]And we're lost in a masquerade.
