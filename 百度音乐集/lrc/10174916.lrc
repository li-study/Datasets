[00:01.42]Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
[00:06.95]When the jungle shadows fall
[00:11.57]Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
[00:16.78]As it stands against the wall
[00:21.68]Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
[00:26.75]When the summer shower is through
[00:31.83]So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
[00:40.88]
[00:41.79]Night and day, you are the one
[00:49.92]Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
[00:58.99]Whether near to me, or far
[01:03.44]It's no matter darling where you are
[01:08.22]I think of you
[01:10.00]
[01:12.04]Night and day, day and night, why is it so
[01:24.98]That this longing for you follows wherever I go
[01:34.06]In the roaring traffic's boom
[01:38.41]In the silence of my lonely room
[01:43.04]I think of you
[01:45.27]
[01:46.78]Night and day, night and day,
[01:55.13]Under the hide of me
[01:59.47]There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
[02:08.32]And it's torment won't be through
[02:12.90]Till you let me spend my life making love to you
[02:19.13]Day and night, night and day

[02:50.55]Night and day, you are the one

[03:07.70]Whether near to me, or far
[03:12.04]It's no matter darling where you are
[03:16.45]I think of you
[03:20.00]Night and day, night and day,
[03:28.51]Under the hide of me
[03:33.46]There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
[03:41.75]And it's torment won't be through
[03:46.06]Till you let me spend my life making love to you
[03:52.20]Day and night, night and day
