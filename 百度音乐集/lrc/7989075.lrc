[02:41.17]Juliet the dice was loaded from the start

[02:53.74]And I forget the movie song

[03:20.63]Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame
[03:26.59]Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
[03:31.56]And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
[03:38.83]How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
[03:44.95]When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
[03:52.15]You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
[03:58.42]You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
[04:04.57]Now you just say oh romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him
[04:10.12]Juliet when we made love you used to cry
[04:16.85]You said I love you like the stars above and I love you till I die
[04:22.06]There's a place for us you know the movie song
[04:28.91]When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong juliet?
[04:48.83]I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
[04:55.54]And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
[05:01.89]I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
[05:07.99]I can't do anything except be in love you
[05:15.06]And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
[05:21.30]And all I do is keep th beat and bad company
[05:27.62]All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
[05:33.89]Julie I'd do the stars with you any time
[05:39.29]Juliet when we made love you used to cry
[05:45.38]You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
[05:51.00]And there's a place for us you know the movie song
[05:58.79]When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong juliet?
[08:23.93]finds that streetlight steps out of the shade
[08:28.80]Says something like you and me babe how about it?
