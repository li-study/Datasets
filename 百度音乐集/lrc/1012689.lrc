[00:14.37]Dublin Sky
[00:27.93]I've been down a lonely street tonight
[00:32.62]And I don't know what's wrong with me
[00:36.01]I don't know what's wrong with me
[00:41.58]The clouds cover up the Dublin sky
[00:46.24]I don't know what's left of me
[00:49.68]I don't know what's right with me
[00:54.54]And I've tried to keep my distance
[00:57.65]And I've sung Amazing Grace
[01:01.00]I've tarnished all our memories
[01:04.88]But there'll always be a trace of you
[01:14.48]Of you
[01:22.57]I remember laughing on that river's edge
[01:27.24]Trying to get you to jump with me
[01:30.67]Trying to get you to fall for me
[01:35.93]And your trembling heart it beat so fast
[01:40.83]Holdings hands you promised me
[01:44.32]Holding hands we counted to three
[01:49.03]And I felt your slipping fingers
[01:52.21]And I saw you change your mind
[01:55.68]If I hadn't dragged you in with me
[01:59.47]You would have let me dive without you
[02:15.96]Without you
[02:30.74]They sent you all the way from Hollywood
[02:37.54]And maybe that Dublin sky was changing you
[02:42.33]It put diamonds in your eyes
[02:48.09]I always thought we were going to make it through
[02:53.41]But I wanted to hear it first from you
[03:10.78]How many days am I going to regret you?
[03:13.81]How many nights till I forget you?
[03:17.32]Have I been wasting all those years?
[03:21.64]Held down by these tears?
[03:24.68]How many dreams have I left deserted?
[03:27.54]How many hopes have been diverted?
[03:31.10]Have I been buried in the dirt?
[03:35.30]Held down by this hurt?
[03:37.81]How many loads did I let you hijack?
[03:41.20]How many ways can I stand here in playback?
[03:44.64]How did I end up lying here
[03:48.84]Crying underneath the Dublin sky?
[03:51.44]How many days am I going to regret you?
[03:54.84]How many nights till I forget you?
[03:58.30]Have I been wasting all these years?
[04:02.53]Drowning in my tears?
[04:05.13]How many nights am I going to regret you?
[04:08.57]How many days till I forget you?
[04:11.94]Have I been wasting all these years?
[04:16.22]Drowning in my tears?
