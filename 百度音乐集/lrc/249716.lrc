[00:11.00]
[00:16.00]How long has it been
[00:23.00]since I held you near?
[00:30.00]How long will it be
[00:34.00]till I have you right here?
[00:43.00]You say that it hurts
[00:49.00]I can't disagree
[00:56.00]But how can I hold on
[01:00.00]to someone who's leaving me?
[04:10.00][03:47.00][02:58.00][01:06.00]And Mary says she's gonna be OK
[04:17.00][03:04.00][01:13.00]She tells me things are getting busier these days
[03:53.00]She tells me things will be much easier someday
[04:23.00][03:59.00][03:10.00][01:19.00]And Mary says she's gonna be alrignt
[03:15.00][01:25.00]You know how much I miss her in my life
[04:05.00]You know how much I'm missing her deep inside
[03:22.00][01:32.00]Goodbye yesterday,
[03:26.00][01:36.00]I see my dreams walking away
[03:36.00][01:46.00]And Mary looks just like she did before
[03:41.00][01:52.00]Except she don't love me
[01:55.00]she don't love me amymore
[02:13.00]I could shake your hand
[02:17.00]or I could kiss you goodbye
[02:23.00]But I just might break down
[02:27.00]looking in your brown eyes
[02:35.00]So what happens next
[02:41.00]do I listen to my mind or heart?
[02:48.00]I don't know where to start
[02:51.00]feeling alright again...
