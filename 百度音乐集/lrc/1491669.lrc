[00:06.34]Title: I Miss My Friend
[00:14.93]I miss the look of surrender in your eyes
[00:22.27]The way your soft brown hair would fall
[00:29.08]I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
[00:36.08]But baby most of all
[00:40.97]I miss my friend
[00:46.04]The one my heart and soul confided in
[00:51.33]The one I felt the safest with
[00:55.58]The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
[01:04.66]And let the light back in
[01:08.25]I miss my friend
[01:17.49]I miss the colors that you brought into my life
[01:24.65]Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes
[01:30.65]I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now
[01:37.49]Saying it'll be alright
[01:42.62]I miss my friend
[01:47.02]The one my heart and soul confided in
[01:53.20]The one I felt the safest with
[01:57.34]The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
[02:05.58]And let the light back in
[02:09.86]I miss my friend
[02:13.71]I miss those times
[02:15.02]I miss those nights
[02:17.67]I even miss our silly fights
[02:20.40]The making up
[02:22.06]The morning talks
[02:24.08]And those late afternoon walks
[02:27.89]I miss my friend
[02:31.83]The one my heart and soul confided in
[02:37.41]The one I felt the safest with
[02:41.74]The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
[02:54.38]I miss my friend
[03:01.28]I miss my friend
[03:08.63]I miss my friend
[03:17.26]Mmmmmmmm
[03:22.50]I miss my friend
