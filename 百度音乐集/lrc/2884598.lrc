[00:01.12]There For Tomorrow - Just In Time
[00:07.89]
[00:15.99]Something wrong with me
[00:19.55]I'm not getting along with me
[00:24.84]My eyes pasted on the ceiling
[00:29.52]I can't get my mind to stop working
[00:34.03]
[00:34.60]I knew all the blackest blues
[00:39.09]You were all my favorite tunes
[00:43.79]This was all I had to lose
[00:48.22]
[00:48.47]Tried out for size
[00:50.53]to my surprise
[00:52.75]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[00:57.42]No more disguise
[00:59.79]Cause I realize
[01:02.05]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[01:07.22]Oh you, oh you left just in time
[01:14.08]
[01:16.47]Should have known to turn
[01:19.87]Get ahead of the curve but I've learned
[01:25.53]the failure sounds all to familiar to me
[01:29.82]to just keep my mind to stop working
[01:34.40]
[01:34.82]I knew all the blackest blues
[01:39.75]You were all my favorite tunes
[01:44.41]This was all I had to lose
[01:49.09]
[01:49.31]Tried out for size
[01:50.94]to my surprise
[01:53.23]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[01:58.08]No more disguise
[02:00.13]Cause I realize
[02:02.42]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[02:07.51]Oh you, oh you left just in time
[02:15.10]
[02:21.68]As the light
[02:23.49]Darkens again
[02:25.23]I lose myself within
[02:28.36]Cause in the end
[02:30.44]Still I'm reminded
[02:34.92]Still I'm reminded
[02:39.49]
[02:39.75]Tried out for size
[02:41.98]to my surprise
[02:44.26]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[02:49.11]No more disguise
[02:51.20]Cause I realize
[02:53.55]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[02:58.49]Tried out for size
[03:02.84]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[03:07.66]No more disguise
[03:09.81]Cause I realize
[03:12.13]I can't fit in anybody's arms
[03:17.16]Oh you, oh you left just in time
[03:26.07]You left just in time
[03:30.43]
