[ti:Once You Had Gold]
[ar:Enya]
[al:The Memory of Trees]

[00:14.18]Once you had gold,
[00:17.70]Once you had silver,
[00:21.51]Then came the rains
[00:25.54]out of the blue.
[00:29.59]Ever and always.
[00:33.62]Always and ever.
[00:37.84]Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.
[00:48.48]Now you can see
[00:52.01]Spring becomes autumn,
[00:55.90]leaves become gold
[00:59.72]falling from view.
[01:04.32]Ever and always.
[01:08.17]Always and ever.
[01:12.65]No-one can promise a dream come true,
[01:23.01]Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.
[02:16.51]What is the dark;
[02:20.30]shadows around you,
[02:24.29]why not take heart
[02:28.17]in the new day?
[02:32.81]Ever and always.
[02:36.23]Always and ever.
[02:41.25]No-one can promise a dream for you,
[02:51.09]Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.
