[00:08.04]Every day I write the list
[00:12.34]Of reasons why I still believe they do exist
[00:15.78](a thousand beautiful things)
[00:19.47]And even though it's hard to see
[00:22.28]The glass is full and not half empty
[00:27.27](a thousand beautiful things)
[00:32.33]So... light me up like the sun
[00:38.98]To cool down with your rain
[00:44.72]I never want to close my eyes again
[00:49.16]Never close my eyes
[00:51.90]Never close my eyes
[01:01.86]
[01:02.36]I thank you for the air to breathe
[01:04.37]The heart to beat
[01:06.16]The eyes to see again
[01:09.03](a thousand beautiful things)
[01:12.86]And all the things that's been and done
[01:15.64]The battle's won
[01:17.52]The good and bad in everyone
[01:20.20](this is mine to remember)
[01:24.58]So ...
[01:25.63]Here I go again
[01:29.92]Singin' by your window
[01:35.46]Pickin' up the pieces of what's left to find
[01:44.09]
[01:44.62]The world was meant for you and me
[01:58.19]To figure out our destiny
[02:01.11](a thousand beautiful things)
[02:07.74]To live
[02:08.46]To die
[02:09.03]To breathe
[02:09.68]To sleep
[02:10.42]To try to make your life complete
[02:11.03](yes yes)
[02:18.68]So ...
[02:19.49]Light me up like the sun
[02:25.78]To cool down with your rain
[02:32.96]I never want to close my eyes again
[02:37.82]Never close my eyes
[02:40.34]never close my eyes ...
[02:46.86]That is everything I have to say
[02:49.60](that's all I have to say)
