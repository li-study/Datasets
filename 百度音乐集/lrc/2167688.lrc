[00:14.59]White dress at my party
[00:17.02]She wanted to be alone with nobody
[00:20.57]But I stood near her until she saw me
[00:24.19]And when she looked up
[00:26.24]This is what she said to me:
[00:29.21]White dress at your party
[00:32.07]I wanted to be alone with nobody
[00:35.28]But you stood near me
[00:37.14]And you don't know me
[00:38.91]You act like an only child
[00:40.85]Are you lonely?
[01:40.20][01:36.86][01:32.76][01:29.05][00:54.85][00:51.09][00:47.05][00:43.94]I know what you need,

[01:14.37]I know what she's thinking
[01:16.89]S.O.S, yes this ship is sinking
[01:20.77]So you should hold me
[01:22.59]No need to know me
[01:24.43]If only tonight
[01:25.80]You'll be my one and only
[02:27.94][02:13.43]It started out between the sheets
[02:31.55][02:16.94](I never said that word; I'll never say that word!)
[02:34.71][02:20.30]But now I need you here with me
[02:38.60][02:24.10](It's safe to say that word; baby say that word!)
