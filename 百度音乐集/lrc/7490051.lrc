[00:00.00]Skeeter Davis - "The End Of The World"
[00:00.50]
[00:08.00]Why does the sun go on shining?
[00:14.00]Why does the sea rush to shore?
[00:20.19]Don't they know it's the end of the world
[00:27.73]'Cause you don't love me any more?
[00:33.66]Why do the birds go on singing?
[00:41.23]Why do the stars glow above?
[00:48.43]Don't they know it's the end of the world?
[00:50.12]It ended when I lost your love.
[01:00.12]I wake up in the morning and I wonder
[01:08.58]Why ev'rything's the same as it was.
[01:15.42]I can't understand, no I can't understand
[01:22.90]How life goes on the way it does
[01:29.38]Why does my heart go on beating?
[01:36.17]Why do these eyes of mine cry?
[01:42.08]Don't they know it's the end of the world?
[01:50.71]It ended when you said goodbye
[01:55.38]Why does my heart go on beating?
[02:04.17]Why do these eyes of mine cry?
[02:11.81]Don't they know it's the end of the world?
[02:19.42]It ended when you said goodbye.
