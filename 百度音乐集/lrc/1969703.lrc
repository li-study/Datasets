[00:01.15]Train - My Private Nation
[00:17.05]Why you gotta treat me like I'm a low down dirty
[00:20.93]Climbin' up on thirty
[00:22.44]Dress like a kid to make me feel young punk
[00:25.77]And talk junk
[00:26.09]You musta fell out of your bunk
[00:28.41]And smacked your head
[00:30.01]Or your face or somethin'
[00:33.72]I don't need nobody flyin' in my jet stream
[00:37.43]Take the bus
[00:38.33]Go on and get yourself your own dream
[00:41.10]This is my own life keepin' me down
[00:45.20]Where I wanna be in my private nation
[00:49.45]I'm alone all thinkin' life's a phone call
[00:52.97]Here for just a while when in my private nation
[00:57.67]You can ride or you can go
[01:09.20]Why you gonna step on shoes
[01:10.22]When you don't know whose been in 'em
[01:13.20]Have you ever been more than a bump
[01:15.23]On a rock that likes to roll
[01:17.29]In the middle of a soup bowl in the sky
[01:20.21]Use your eyes
[01:22.31]It's all you got till you die
[01:24.96]I don't need nobody flyin' in my jet stream
[01:29.03]Take the bus
[01:30.44]Go on and get yourself your own dream
[01:32.87]This is my own life keepin' me down
[01:37.19]Where I wanna be in my private nation
[01:41.01]I'm alone all thinkin' life's a phone call
[01:45.02]Here for just a while when in my private nation
[01:48.63]You can ride on, it ain't free
[01:52.25]Leave a light on, so you can see
[01:57.09]How to get back when you go
[02:08.33]How to get, how to give
[02:10.35]How to make ends meet
[02:12.28]How to lose, how to win
[02:14.12]How to stay on the seat
[02:15.91]How to use momentum to keep the two wheels straight
[02:20.04]How to wait after it feels like you waited so long
