[00:02.46]Sweet Child O' Mine
[00:05.00]guns n' roses
[00:08.00]
[00:46.53]He's got a smile that it seems to me
[00:49.92]Reminds me of childhood memories
[00:53.69]Where everything
[00:55.27]Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
[01:01.63]Now and then when I see his face
[01:05.01]He takes me away to that special place
[01:08.58]And if I stared too long
[01:10.87]I'd probably break down and cry
[01:16.67]Oh, Sweet child o' mine
[01:24.25]Oh oh oh oh, Sweet love of mine
[01:29.57]
[01:47.70]He's got eyes of the bluest skies
[01:50.98]As if they thought of rain
[01:55.15]I hate to look into those eyes
[01:58.79]And see an ounce of pain
[02:02.82]His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
[02:06.47]Where as a child I'd hide
[02:10.42]And pray for the thunder
[02:12.79]And the rain
[02:14.29]To quietly pass me by
[02:18.22]Oh, Sweet child o' mine
[02:25.10]Oh oh oh oh , Sweet love of mine
[02:31.19]
[03:04.73]Oh oh oh, Sweet child o' mine
[03:12.20]Oh oh oh, Sweet love of mine
[03:20.01]Oh oh oh oh, Sweet child o' mine
[03:25.86]oh Sweet love of mine
