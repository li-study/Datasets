[00:10.47]Boys Don't Cry
[00:12.73]The Cure
[00:17.57]
[00:28.50]I would say I’m sorry
[00:30.77]if I thought that it would change your mind
[00:35.15]But I know that this time I have said too much
[00:39.58]been too unkind
[00:42.53](So)I try to laugh about it
[00:45.17]covering it all up with lies
[00:49.36]I try to laugh about it
[00:52.00]hiding the tears in my eyes, ’cause
[00:55.22]Boys don’t cry
[01:02.33]Boys don’t cry
[01:08.05]
[01:09.34]I would break down at your feet
[01:12.50]and beg forgiveness plead with you
[01:15.74]But I know that it’s too late
[01:18.62]and now there’s nothing I can do
[01:22.04]
[01:23.27](So)I try to laugh about it
[01:26.08]covering it all up with lies
[01:30.05]I try to laugh about it
[01:32.87]hiding the tears in my eyes, ’cause
[01:35.92]Boys don’t cry
[01:43.20]Boys don’t cry
[01:48.97]
[01:49.75]I would tell you that I loved you
[01:53.14]if I thought that you would stay
[01:56.54]But I know that it’s no use
[02:00.03]That you’ve already gone away
[02:02.94]
[02:04.26]Misjudged your limits
[02:07.33]Pushed you too far
[02:10.78]Took you for granted
[02:13.52]I thought that you needed me more
[02:16.15]
[02:16.73]Now I would do almost anything
[02:20.45]to get you back by my side
[02:23.44]But I just keep on laughing
[02:26.79]hiding the tears in my eyes, ’cause
[02:30.22]Boys don’t cry
[02:37.07]Boys don’t cry
[02:42.44]
[02:46.93]Boys don’t cry
