[00:07.90]
[00:48.81]I used to be so fearless so limitless and free
[00:52.74]Happy on my own and nothing really bothered me.
[00:56.66]I had desires to see the world, jump out of planes and fly
[01:00.59]And I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
[01:05.62]
[01:12.62]I used to be so sure of things and self-contained
[01:16.75]I could carry on with no need to explain
[01:20.67]It didn't matter if I ever made it home
[01:24.52]Could go too fast, and drink all night and dance alone
[01:28.76]
[01:32.81]I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
[01:38.71]
[01:40.51]I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
[01:46.80]
[02:00.01]I've got everything to lose
[02:04.97]
[02:08.71]I used to be so thoughtless, so easy and free
[02:12.68]Could walk away, not think ahead, and had no plans to keep.
[02:16.49]No hand to told, no one to bring down with me.
[02:20.49]I wouldn't see the worst and it only hurts me.
[02:26.00]
[02:28.67]I love to be alive but I was not afraid to die
[02:34.75]
[02:40.00]I've got everything to lose
[02:47.52]
[02:50.18]Since I've met you
[02:56.27]I've got everything to lose
