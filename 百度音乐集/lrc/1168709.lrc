[00:16.91]Are they calling for our last dance?
[00:25.05]I see it in your eyes ... in your eyes
[00:44.82]Same old knows for and you romance
[00:51.52]I could use the same old lines ...
[01:03.99]but I'll sing
[01:05.40]
[01:08.25]Shine on, just shine on
[01:13.40]Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
[01:18.80]They can scream and shout
[01:21.84]that they've been sold out,
[01:24.56]but it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
[01:29.53]So shine on, just shine on
[01:34.91]With your smile just as bright as the sun
[01:40.41]Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
[01:46.47]But you and I, just shone, just shone
[01:52.76]
[01:58.07]And when silence greets my last goodbye
[02:04.60]The words I need are in you're eyes
[02:17.42]And I'll sing .....
[02:19.07]
[02:21.81]Shine on, just shine on
[02:26.96]Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
[02:32.32]They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
[02:37.99]but it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
[02:42.87]So shine on, just shine on
[02:48.28]With your smile just as bright as the sun
[02:53.55]Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
[02:59.46]But you and I just shone, just shone
[03:05.31]
[03:25.10]So shine on, just shine on
[03:30.45]Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
[03:35.76]They can scream and shout that they've been sold out,
[03:41.34]but it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
[03:46.21]So shine on, just shine on
[03:51.59]With your smile just as bright as the sun
[03:56.87]Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
[04:02.84]But you and I just shone, just shone
