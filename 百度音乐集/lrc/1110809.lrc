[00:35.20]I thought it was funny when you missed the train
[00:41.71]When I rang you at home they said you left yesterday
[00:49.50]I thought it was strange when your car was found
[00:56.35]by the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around
[01:02.59]Dear Isobel
[01:04.77]I hope you're well and what you've done is right
[01:09.73]Oh it's been such hell
[01:11.90]I wish you well and hope your safe tonight
[01:15.87]It's been a long day coming and long will it last
[01:24.08]when it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
[01:31.29]by loving you more
[01:43.03]And who he would become, all the things he'd have done
[01:48.79]would he have loved you, and not let you down
[01:56.15]and would he be stronger than his father
[02:02.54]don't punish yourself, leave it well alone
[02:09.50]Dear Isobel
[02:11.97]I hope you're well and what you've done is right
[02:16.61]Oh it's been such hell
[02:18.68]I wish you well and hope your safe tonight
[02:23.51]It's been a long day coming and long will it last
[02:30.89]when it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
[02:38.16]by loving you more
