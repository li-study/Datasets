[00:-3.50]Welcome To My Life
[00:-2.50]Simple Plan
[00:-1.50]
[00:10.03]Do you ever feel like breaking down
[00:13.49]Do you ever feel out of place
[00:16.26]Like somehow you just don't belong
[00:19.22]And no one understands you
[00:21.73]Do you ever wanna run away
[00:24.48]Do you lock yourself in your room
[00:27.22]With the radio on turned up so loud
[00:30.30]That no one hears you screaming
[00:32.78]No you don't know what it's like
[00:35.73]When nothing feels alright
[00:38.58]You don't know what it's like to be like me
[00:43.66]To be hurt
[00:44.87]To feel lost
[00:46.27]To be left out in the dark
[00:49.00]To be kicked
[00:50.45]When you're down
[00:51.78]To feel like you've been pushed around
[00:54.53]To be on the edge of breaking down
[00:57.98]And no one's there to save you
[01:00.46]No you don't know what it's like
[01:04.98]Welcome to my life
[01:07.29]
[01:08.53]Do you wanna be somebody else
[01:11.54]Are you sick of feeling so left out
[01:14.28]Are you desperate to find something more
[01:17.31]Before your life is over
[01:19.86]Are you stuck inside a world you hate
[01:22.55]Are you sick of everyone around
[01:25.36]With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
[01:28.36]While deep inside you're bleeding
[01:30.88]No you don't know what it's like
[01:33.89]When nothing feels alright
[01:36.71]You don't know what it's like to be like me
[01:41.74]To be hurt
[01:43.07]To feel lost
[01:44.40]To be left out in the dark
[01:47.12]To be kicked
[01:48.58]When you're down
[01:49.95]To feel like you've been pushed around
[01:52.67]To be on the edge of breaking down
[01:56.07]And no one's there to save you
[01:58.60]No you don't know what it's like
[02:03.00]Welcome to my life
[02:05.50]
[02:09.74]No one ever lies straight to your face
[02:12.70]And no one ever stabbed you in the back
[02:15.47]You might think I'm happy
[02:17.77]But I'm not gonna be ok
[02:21.20]Everybody always gave you what you wanted
[02:23.88]You never had to work it was always there
[02:26.48]You don't know what it's like
[02:28.69]What it's like
[02:31.50]To be hurt
[02:32.95]To feel lost
[02:34.33]To be left out in the dark
[02:37.05]To be kicked
[02:38.41]When you're down
[02:39.85]To feel like you've been pushed around
[02:42.59]To be on the edge of breaking down
[02:46.03]And no one's there to save you
[02:48.42]No you don't know what it's like (what it's like)
[02:53.71]To be hurt
[02:54.99]To feel lost
[02:56.39]To be left out in the dark
[02:59.13]To be kicked
[03:00.56]When you're down
[03:02.02]To feel like you've been pushed around
[03:04.69]To be on the edge of breaking down
[03:08.11]And no one's there to save you
