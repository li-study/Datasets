[00:00.48]Tristan Prettyman - In Bloom
[00:06.64]
[00:15.66]Our love fell out of winter
[00:19.41]Along with the leaves
[00:22.98]And bloomed into spring
[00:29.22]Taking all of our chances
[00:33.19]And all of our dreams
[00:36.33]And turned 'em into possibilities
[00:39.52]
[00:43.70]I wanna know
[00:47.07]What you're thinking
[00:48.26]When you're lying in your bed late at night
[00:57.30]Trying to keep so still
[01:00.36]My heart is pounding
[01:03.21]And it's trying just to keep up with the time
[01:07.15]
[01:09.29]I am not yours
[01:12.66]You are not mine
[01:14.47]
[01:32.12]Trees sway, seasons change
[01:35.61]And so did my heart
[01:38.42]We bend 'til we break
[01:41.30]And then we fall apart
[01:45.40]You made your point
[01:46.96]And I rest my case
[01:50.92]My dear, you're just a little bit too late
[01:55.54]
[02:00.26]I wanna know
[02:03.01]What you're thinking
[02:04.11]When you're lying in your bed late at night
[02:13.67]Trying to keep so still
[02:16.70]My heart is pounding
[02:18.45]And it's trying just to keep up with the time
[02:23.66]
[02:25.70]I am not yours
[02:29.10]You are not mine
[02:31.35]
[02:59.25]Tell me baby
[03:02.90]I wanna know
[03:05.54]What you're thinking
[03:06.36]When you're lying in your bed late at night
[03:16.12]Trying to keep so still
[03:19.16]My heart is pounding
[03:21.04]And it's trying just to keep up with the time
[03:26.19]
[03:28.23]I am not yours
[03:31.80]You are not mine
[03:34.11]
