[00:22.53]I was wayward child
[00:25.10]With the weight of the world
[00:27.59]That I held deep inside
[00:32.01]Life was a winding road
[00:34.38]And I learned many things
[00:36.66]Little ones shouldn’t know
[00:39.32]But I closed my eyes
[00:43.21]Steadied my feet on the ground
[00:45.95]Raised my head to the sky
[00:48.56]And though time’s rolled by
[00:53.51]Still feel like that child
[00:55.13]As I look at the monn
[00:58.38]Maybe I grew up
[01:00.26]A little too soon
[01:22.61]Funny how one can learn
[01:25.13]To grow numb to the madness
[01:27.87]And block it away
[01:31.89]I left the worst unsaid
[01:34.36]Let it all dissipate
[01:36.71]And I try to forget
[01:39.54]But I closed my eyes
[01:43.22]Steadied my feet on the ground
[01:45.91]Raised my head to the sky
[01:48.59]And though time’s rolled by
[01:53.49]Still feel like that child
[01:55.14]As I look at the monn
[01:58.10]Maybe I grew up
[02:00.25]A little too soon
[02:22.71]Nearing the edge
[02:24.91]Obvious I almost
[02:28.33]Fell right over A part of me
[02:34.26]Will never be quite able
[02:37.39]To feel stable
[02:40.80]That woman-child falling inside
[02:45.03]Was on the verge of fading
[02:50.55]Thankfully I
[02:52.73]Woke up in time
[02:59.70]Guardian angel I
[03:02.22]Sail away on an ocean
[03:04.77]With you by my side
[03:08.89]Orange clouds roll by
[03:11.43]They burn into your image
[03:13.78]And you’re still alive
[03:16.97]But I closed my eyes
[03:20.66]Steadied my feet on the ground
[03:23.56]Raise my head to the sky
[03:26.12]And though time’s rolls by
[03:30.92]Still feel like that child
[03:32.61]As I look at the monn
[03:35.79]Maybe I grew up
[03:37.50]A little too soon
