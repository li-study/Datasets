[00:04.21]A Thousand Words
[00:15.21]
[00:48.13]We stumble in a tangled web,
[00:50.55]decaying friendships almost dead
[00:53.08]And hide behind a mask of lies
[00:57.47]We twist and turn and we avoid,
[00:59.79]all hope of salvage now devoid
[01:01.96]I see truth inside your eyes
[01:05.73]So take all this noise into your brain
[01:11.62]and send it back again
[01:15.41]I'll bear the cost, shed my skin,
[01:20.62]call you up and then...
[01:24.79]I'll say the words out loud
[01:27.26]You could resurrect a thousand words
[01:30.75]to deceive me more and more
[01:36.33]A thousand words will give the reasons
[01:39.59]why I don't need you anymore
[01:54.37]Time manipulates your heart,
[01:56.80]preconceptions torn apart
[01:59.31]Begin to doubt my state of mind
[02:03.49]But I won't go down on what I said
[02:05.82]I won't retract convictions read
[02:08.16]I may perplex, but I'm not blind
[02:12.27]So take all this noise into your brain
[02:17.39]and send it back again
[02:21.65]I'll bear the cost, shed my skin,
[02:26.37]call you up and then...
[02:30.87]I'll say the words out loud
[02:33.04]You could resurrect a thousand words
[02:36.65]to deceive me more and more
[02:42.51]A thousand words will give the reasons
[02:45.17]why I don't need you anymore
[02:51.74]I'll say the words out loud.
[02:55.27]I'll say a thousand words or more Manipulation.
[03:01.31]Fabrication. Conversation.  Annihilation
[03:04.77]I'll say a thousand words or more
[03:09.27]Damnation. Frustration. Elevation.
[03:12.62]Procreation
[03:14.72]I'll say a thousand words or more
[03:42.71][03:23.38]You could ressurect a thousand words
[03:45.89][03:27.40]to deceive me more and more
