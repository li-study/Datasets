[00:01.39]Strawberry Avalanche
[00:03.89]Owl City
[00:06.48]
[00:15.64]This is a world of dreams and reverie
[00:24.05]Where I felt the stars explode around me.
[00:32.36]A grasp light flashed with a gleam
[00:35.06]as it slashed open a moon beam
[00:37.64]And I stared back breathlessly
[00:40.49]as mountains of fruit tumbled out;
[00:43.33]I barely had the chance to shout.
[00:45.79]A strawberry avalanche crashed over me.
[00:50.77]
[01:05.18]Staying awake that night was rather hard
[01:13.45]Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard.
[01:21.56]When we woke up buried alive
[01:24.53]beneath the fruity landslide we both laughed hysterically.
[01:29.78]It could've been just another dream,
[01:32.60]But I swear I heard you scream.
[01:34.98]A strawberry avalanche crashed over me.
[01:39.99]
[01:55.25]Always a citrus constellation
[02:01.08]In the galaxy, scratched on the back
[02:06.54]Of both my eye lids that I've been dying to see.
[02:12.92]If you were a beautiful sound and the echo's all around,
[02:17.91]Then I'd be your harmony
[02:21.07]And we'd sing along with the crowds
[02:23.83]Beneath the candy coated clouds
[02:26.19]Of strawberry avalanche, jeez, crashed over me.
[02:31.15]
[02:46.00]See the world of dreams and reverie
[02:54.03]Where I felt the stars explode around me.
