[00:00.00]Def Leppard - Gravity
[00:06.20]
[00:12.93]Can't sleep at night
[00:17.10]The darkness enslaves me
[00:21.64]I turn out the light
[00:26.06]And no one can save me
[00:29.65]So try not to stare 'cause I'm stripped to the bone
[00:33.93]It's a trick of the light and I'm lost
[00:37.93]Feel like I'm falling
[00:39.74]Gravity is dragging me
[00:41.03]My head's about to break (Can't break my fall)
[00:43.20]Insanity inside of me
[00:45.51]It's like I'm wide awake
[00:47.12]Feel like I'm falling
[00:47.93]Can't recognize
[00:48.87]I'm hypnotized
[00:50.00]These feelings got me plagued (Can't take it all)
[00:52.02]This gravity is killing me
[00:54.66]I can't stand up from falling down
[00:57.93]I lie to myself
[01:02.47]It don't make it easy, easy
[01:06.99]If somebody else
[01:11.51]Would only believe me
[01:15.15]My sweat soaks the sheets and I'm hung out to dry
[01:19.35]It's a trick of the light and I'm lost
[01:23.23]Feel like I'm falling

[01:42.10]Wake up
[01:42.93](Falling)
[01:43.14]Don't try to catch me, just let me fall
[01:46.93]Eyes wide shut, don't make a sound
[01:49.13]Keep falling till I hit the ground
