[00:06.00]Stranger in Moscow
[00:22.00]Michael Jackson
[00:56.00]I was wandering in the rain
[01:00.00]Mask of life, feelin' insane
[01:03.00]Swift and sudden fall from grace
[01:07.00]Sunny days seem far away
[01:11.00]Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
[01:13.00]Stalin's tomb won't let me be
[01:18.00]On and on and on it came
[01:22.00]Wish the rain would just let me
[01:24.00]How does it feel (How does it feel)
[01:28.00]How does it feel
[01:32.00]How does it feel
[01:35.00]When you're alone
[01:37.00]And you're cold inside
[01:44.00]Here abandoned in my fame
[01:47.00]Armageddon of the brain
[01:51.00]KGB was doggin' me
[01:55.00]Take my name and just let me be
[01:58.00]Then a begger boy called my name
[02:02.00]Happy days will drown the pain
[02:06.00]On and on and on it came
[02:09.00]And again, and again, and again...
[02:10.00]Take my name and just let me be
[02:12.00]How does it feel (How does it feel)
[02:16.00]How does it feel
[02:20.00]How does it feel
[02:24.00]How does it feel
[02:27.00]How does it feel (How does it feel now)
[02:31.00]How does it feel
[02:34.00]How does it feel
[02:38.00]When you're alone
[02:39.00]And you're cold inside
[03:15.00]How does it feel (How does it feel)
[03:19.00]How does it feel
[03:22.00]How does it feel
[03:26.00]How does it feel
[03:30.00]How does it feel (How does it feel now)
[03:34.00]How does it feel
[03:37.00]How does it feel
[03:41.00]When you're alone
[03:42.00]And you're cold inside
[03:47.00]Like stranger in Moscow
[03:55.00]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:02.00]We're talkin' danger
[04:05.00]We're talkin' danger, baby
[04:09.00]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:16.00]We're talkin' danger
[04:20.00]We're talkin' danger, baby
[04:24.00]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:31.00]I'm live in lonely
