[00:01.15]The Best Mistake I've Ever Made
[00:04.56]演唱：王若琳
[00:07.00]
[00:23.54]One step too far
[00:27.00]All at once I'm falling
[00:29.31]Just like a star
[00:32.78]I'm buring for you
[00:35.18]Thought I could keep myself from feeling this way
[00:39.82]I guess that was my first mistake
[00:43.84]
[00:45.90]Cause suddenly I'm walking
[00:48.67]Down a dark street to your door
[00:51.68]Wanting you is driving me insane
[00:56.92]And now my feet are standing
[00:59.74]Where they've never stood before
[01:02.80]Guided by a twist of fate
[01:07.40]
[01:08.03]If I lose myself with you tonight
[01:14.48]Fall apart or hold on tight
[01:20.27]Wrong or right
[01:22.34]I won't be afraid
[01:25.33]Cause even if my heart should break
[01:30.80]You'd be the best mistake I ever made
[01:36.49]
[01:38.23]I'm in your room
[01:41.26]Now there's no denying
[01:43.81]What's in your eyes
[01:47.00]When I look at you
[01:49.30]To shadows talking but they don't make a sound
[01:54.43]Words have lost their meaning now
[01:58.25]
[01:59.87]And the air has turned electric
[02:02.66]Now I know the time is right
[02:05.60]To put myself into your hands
[02:11.32]And suddenly I'm shaking
[02:14.14]As your fingers touch my skin
[02:17.35]I don't need to understand
[02:21.14]
[02:22.18]But If I lose myself with you tonight
[02:28.68]Fall apart or hold on tight
[02:34.51]Wrong or right
[02:36.62]I won't be afraid
[02:39.73]Cause even if my heart should break
[02:44.92]You'd be the best mistake I ever made
[02:48.93]
[02:50.80]And if tomorrow proves me wrong
[02:55.94]I swear I don't belong
[03:01.80]I know I'll carry on
[03:06.99]
[03:07.52]So I will lose myself and bare my soul
[03:14.09]Take this chance cause heaven knows
[03:19.51]I'm so far gone, my choice is made
[03:25.18]And even if my heart should break
[03:29.27]
[03:30.83]When I lose myself with you tonight
[03:36.79]Fall apart or hold on tight
[03:42.77]Wrong or right
[03:44.78]I'll always say
[03:47.95]You're the best mistake I ever made
[03:53.46]You're the best mistake I ever made
[03:59.23]You're the best mistake I ever made
[04:05.13]
