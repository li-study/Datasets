[00:12.20]I couldn't sleep last night
[00:13.95]I walked alone
[00:15.45]On the beach
[00:16.32]Where we always used to go
[00:19.13]When we couldn't hook up at home
[00:24.19]I thought of you
[00:25.13]And the time we jumped the fence
[00:27.26]Both sides ripped down
[00:29.01]We dove right in
[00:31.01]And the cops chased us again
[00:35.76]When you were mine
[00:41.76]You know
[00:44.76]We had it all in front of us
[00:47.69]You were the one
[00:48.76]I was in love
[00:50.51]But you always hurt
[00:51.76]the one you lost
[00:54.69]I couldn't get enough
[00:57.44]You were everything
[01:00.07]That's bad for me
[01:01.69]Make no apologies
[01:04.50]I'm crushed...
[01:05.57]Black and blue
[01:06.94]But you know
[01:07.88]I'd do it all again for you
[01:10.45]Today
[01:11.13]dressed up
[01:11.44]In designer drugs
[01:12.82]Dedicated to the one
[01:14.50]I'll always love
[01:16.44]The one who really messed me up
[01:21.63]I let you take the wheel
[01:23.19]And the driver's seat
[01:24.25]Strapped in
[01:26.41]So you get the best of me
[01:29.10]Now what's left are the memories
[01:34.09]When you were mine
[01:40.10]You know
[01:43.10]We had it all in front of us
[01:46.16]You were the one
[01:47.22]I was in love
[01:48.78]But you always hurt
[01:50.16]The one you lost
[01:51.53]I couldn't get enough
[01:54.22]You were everything
[01:56.85]That's bad for me
[01:58.60]Make no apologies
[02:01.22]I'm crushed...
[02:02.35]Black and blue
[02:03.78]But you know
[02:04.60]I'd do it all again for you
[02:06.35]I am standing in the ocean rain
[02:11.97]Rough and ready
[02:14.78]For your deadly game
[02:17.97]I've got nowhere else to go
[02:24.47]We had it all in front of us
[02:27.53]You were the one
[02:28.72]I was in love
[02:29.40]But you always hurt
[02:30.71]The one you lost
[02:31.96]I couldn't get enough
[02:34.71]You were everything
[02:37.34]That's bad for me
[02:39.15]Make no apologies
[02:41.66]I'm crushed...
[02:42.84]Black and blue
[02:44.15]But you know
[02:45.86]I'd do it all again for you
[02:51.17](You know I'd do it all again )
[02:57.11](I swear I'd do it all again )
