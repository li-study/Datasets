[00:-4.00]Plant Life
[00:-3.00]Owl City
[00:-2.00]

[00:01.87]I saw a ghost on the stairs
[00:07.05]And sheets on the tables and chairs
[00:11.68]The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink
[00:15.90]Even so, I don't know what to think
[00:20.55]
[00:21.89]I've been longing for daisies to push through the floor
[00:30.62]And I wish plant life would grow all around me
[00:34.93]So I won't feel dead anymore,
[00:39.42]So I won't feel dead anymore
[00:43.74]
[00:44.50]I saw a bear in the den reading my textbooks again
[00:53.03]The bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic
[00:57.17]Heaven knows I could really use a friend
[01:01.39]
[01:02.17]I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
[01:06.71]The trees keep the tempo and they swing in time
[01:11.08]Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
[01:15.55]If I were to pluck on your heart strings, would you strum on mine?
[01:21.42]
[01:37.99]I've been longing for daisies to push through the floor
[01:47.18]And I wish plant life would grow all around me
[01:51.40]So I won't feel dead anymore,
[01:56.05]So I won't feel dead anymore
[01:59.66]
[02:00.58]Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet
[02:04.98]And give me a ghost of a smile
[02:09.58]Show me your teeth 'cause you're a teddy beneath
[02:14.09]So just grin and bear it a while,
[02:18.60]So just grin and bear it a while
[02:22.28]
[02:23.20]I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
[02:27.52]The trees keep the tempo and they swing in time
[02:32.04]Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
[02:36.61]If I were to pluck on your heart strings, would you strum on mine?
[02:42.44]
[02:44.66]The book babbles on about nothing at all
[02:53.85]A new leaf turns over, unwilling to fall
[02:58.27]
[02:59.01]Tonight I'm busting out of this old haunted house
[03:07.92]Cause I'm sick of waiting for all those spider webs to grow all around me
[03:17.18]Cause I don't feel dead anymore
[03:21.51]And I'm not afraid anymore
[03:25.63]
[03:26.51]I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
[03:31.12]The trees keep the tempo and they swing in time
[03:35.73]Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
[03:40.59]If I were to pluck on your heart strings, would you strum on mine?
[03:46.83]
[03:55.00]If I were to pluck on your heart strings, would you strum on mine?
[04:03.38]
