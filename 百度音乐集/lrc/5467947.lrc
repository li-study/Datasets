[00:01.14]Roy Orbison
[00:01.79]A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
[00:05.55]Tiptoes to my room every night
[00:09.06]Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
[00:13.05]"Go to sleep. Everything is all right."
[00:19.55]
[00:19.76]I close my eyes, Then I drift away
[00:28.11]Into the magic night. I softly say
[00:32.63]A silent prayerLike dreamers do.
[00:41.37]Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you.
[00:47.35]
[00:56.06]In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you.
[01:13.80]In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together
[01:26.35]In dreams, In dreams.
[01:29.38]
[01:33.78]But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone.
[01:42.33]I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry.
[02:01.85]I remember that you said goodbye.
[02:09.30]
[02:10.04]It's too bad that all these things, Can only happen in my dreams
[02:25.82]Only in dreams In beautiful dreams.
