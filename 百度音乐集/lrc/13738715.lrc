[00:04.18]Michael Bolton - I Surrender
[00:18.60]A million miles beyond the voice of reason
[00:22.60]It's where I can be found
[00:26.68]Got me walking with my head in the clouds
[00:29.98]My feet don't even touch the ground
[00:34.85]I don't know what you've done to me baby
[00:38.83]But my resistence is gone
[00:42.06]I thought I was strong,
[00:46.00]Baby I was wrong
[00:49.70]Cause you call my name and you turn me around
[00:53.42]As my arms reach out and the walls come down
[00:57.49]I surrender
[01:01.72]I'm a fool in a game, I got no way to win
[01:05.64]Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in
[01:09.57]I surrender, I surrender to you
[01:26.88]Life shatters loves innocence
[01:30.88]My trusting days are through
[01:34.80]My resistence was my best defense
[01:37.87]But I never counted on you
[01:42.77]You got the key to my destiny, babe
[01:47.05]Just a willing slave
[01:50.30]I can't walk away, no baby, I can't walk away
[01:57.57]You just call my name, you turn me around
[02:01.74]My arms reach out and the walls come down
[02:05.74]I surrender
[02:09.90]Like the fool in a game, I got no way to win
[02:13.12]Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in
[02:17.90]I surrender, I surrender
[02:26.82]Here I am trying to hold back the ocean
[02:30.61]Drowning in the sea of desire
[02:34.77]I've been betrayed by my own emotions
[02:38.81]You and my senses conspire
[02:44.79]You just call out my name, my life won't be the same
[02:51.87]I surrender
[02:55.68]I'm a fool in the game, I got no way to win
[02:59.67]Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in
[03:03.95]I surrender, I surrender to you
[03:20.04]I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you
[03:31.00]A million miles beyond the voice of reason
[03:35.50]That's where I can be found
