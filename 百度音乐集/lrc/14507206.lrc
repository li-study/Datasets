The mystery of tryin to make it happen
Strugglin just to make ends meet
You need a new change of space
A new direction
This whole thing is so confusing to me
I know you got
Dirty hands from a dirty job
I know you got the
Weight of the world heavy on your heart
You've got the power won't you play the part
Baby just believe that you're a
STAR
Whether you know it or not
Gotta make the most of what you got
Never stop and don't ever give up
STAR
Whether you know it or not

STAR
You're a STAR
There ain't no need for you to look any further
You've got it all in the palm of your hands
Everything that you conceive
Can be yours not just a dream
As the cards unfold
Just remember what you were told
I know you got
Dirty hands from a dirty job
I know you got the
Weight of the world heavy on your heart
You've got the power won't you play the part
Baby just believe that you're a
STAR
Whether you know it or not
Gotta make the most of what you got
Never stop and don't ever give up

Whether you know it or not

You're a STAR [2x]
Go ahead and live your life
You gotta let it shine
I know you got
Dirty hands from a dirty job
I know you got the
Weight of the world heavy on your heart
You've got the power won't you play the part
Baby just believe that you're a
STAR
Whether you know it or not
Gotta make the most of what you got
Never stop and don't ever give up
