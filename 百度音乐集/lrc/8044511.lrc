[00:27.59]My love,there's so many ways
[00:35.02]I want to say I love you
[00:39.63]Let me hold you in my arms forever more
[00:50.89]You have gone and made me such a fool

[02:05.69]In my eyes I see no one else but you
[02:14.35]There's no other love like our love
[02:20.06]And yes,oh yes
[02:24.69]I'll always want you need me
[02:28.55]I've waited for you for so long

[02:40.51]Your love is the only love I need
[02:49.28]And beside me is where I want you to be
[03:05.53]'Cause my love, there is something I want you to know
[03:25.64]You're the love of my life
