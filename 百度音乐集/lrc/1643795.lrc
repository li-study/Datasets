[00:05.32]overjoyed
[00:10.64]
[00:11.42]Over time, I've building my castle of love
[00:23.06]Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
[00:34.81]I've gone much too far for you now to say
[00:41.30]That I've got to throw my castle away
[00:45.38]
[00:45.73]Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
[00:57.32]Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
[01:09.16]The sandman has come from too far away
[01:15.24]For you to say come back some other day
[01:19.74]
[01:20.37]And though you don't believe that they do
[01:24.07]They do come true
[01:26.92]For did my dreams
[01:29.36]Come true when I looked at you
[01:31.85]And maybe too, if you would believe
[01:35.56]You too might be
[01:37.74]Overjoyed, over loved, over me
[01:53.60]
[01:55.09]Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
[02:06.69]Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
[02:18.62]I've come much too far for me now to find
[02:24.33]The love that I've sought can never be mine
[02:29.30]
[02:29.88]And though you don't believe that they do
[02:34.28]They do come true
[02:36.26]For did my dreams
[02:38.71]Come true when I looked at you
[02:41.20]And maybe too, if you would believe
[02:44.77]You too might be
[02:46.99]Overjoyed, over loved, over me
[02:57.97]
[02:58.68]And though the odds say improbable
[03:01.97]What do they know
[03:05.17]For in romance
[03:07.66]All true love needs is a chance
[03:10.14]And maybe with a chance you will find
[03:13.39]You too like I
[03:15.96]Overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you
