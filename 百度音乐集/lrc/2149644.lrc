[00:02.00]Broken Bells - Vaporize
[00:06.00]
[00:09.84]What amounts to a dream anymore?
[00:14.12]A cruel device
[00:16.66]A villain arrives
[00:20.20]A simple plan,
[00:21.97]We'd be different from the rest
[00:24.51]And never resign to a typical life
[00:49.63]Common fears start to multiply
[00:54.09]We realize we're paralyzed.
[00:59.83]Where'd it go?
[01:01.87]All that precious time.
[01:04.20]Did we even try?
[01:06.66]To stem the tide.
[01:10.14]Why should we waste it on.
[01:14.61]Buying into the same old lies?
[01:19.50]The longer we wait around
[01:24.51]The faster the years go by.
[01:30.20]It's not too late
[01:35.67]To feel a little more alive
[01:40.64]Make our escape.
[01:45.59]Before we start to vaporize
[02:19.18]Doubtless
[02:21.89]We've been through this.
[02:24.50]So if you want to follow me.
[02:26.77]You should know.
[02:29.47]I was lost then
[02:31.76]And I'm lost now.
[02:34.24]And I doubt I'll ever know which way to go.
