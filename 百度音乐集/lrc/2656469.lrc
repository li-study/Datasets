[00:07.78]"Peggy Gordon"
[00:08.45]
[00:14.81]O Peggy Gordon, You are my darling
[00:23.72]Come sit you down upon my knee
[00:32.11]And tell to me the very reason
[00:41.02]Why I am slighted so by thee
[00:49.82]
[00:50.77]I'm so in love that I can't deny it
[01:01.08]My heart lies smothered in my breast
[01:11.63]But it's not for you to let the world know it
[01:18.05]A troubled mind can know no rest
[01:24.53]
[01:26.41]I put my head to a glass of brandy
[01:38.74]It was my fancy, I do declare
[01:44.53]For when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking
[01:53.43]And wishing Peggy Gordon was here
[02:02.17]
[02:38.26]I wish I was in some lonesome valley
[03:04.79]Where womankind cannot be found
[03:10.15]Where little birds sing upon the branches
[03:18.10]And every moment has a different sound
[03:26.16]
[03:26.75]O Peggy Gordon, You are my darling
[03:42.33]Come sit you down upon my knee
[03:43.88]And tell to me the very reason
[04:10.41]Fiona the Conqueror~~
