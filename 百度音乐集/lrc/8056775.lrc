[00:00.96]Out Ta Get Me
[00:03.93]
[00:29.35]Been hidin' out
[00:30.63]And layin' low
[00:32.73]It's nothin' new ta me
[00:35.33]Well you can always find a place to go
[00:39.31]If you can keep your sanity
[00:42.37]They break down the doors
[00:43.81]And they rape my rights but
[00:45.36]They won't touch me
[00:49.17]They scream and yell
[00:50.73]And fight all night
[00:53.12]You can't tell me
[00:56.36]I lose my head
[00:58.05]I close my eyes
[00:59.93]They won't touch me
[01:03.06]'Cause I got somethin'
[01:05.08]I been buildin' up inside
[01:06.08]For so fuckin' long
[01:09.21]
[01:09.59]They're out ta get me
[01:11.60]They won't catch me
[01:14.41]I'm innocent
[01:19.50]They won't break me
[01:20.85]
[01:23.79]Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
[01:27.04]Sometimes it's harder to leave
[01:30.36]And everytime you think you know just what you're doin'
[01:33.79]That's when your troubles exceed
[01:38.38]They push me in a corner
[01:39.49]Just to get me to fight but
[01:40.85]They won't touch me
[01:43.71]They preach and yell
[01:45.46]And fight all night
[01:47.69]You can't tell me
[01:50.87]I lose my head
[01:52.44]I close my eyes
[01:54.26]They won't touch me
[01:56.95]'Cause I got somethin'
[01:58.60]I been buildin' up inside
[02:00.73]I'm already gone
[02:03.42]
[02:03.74]They're out ta get me
[02:05.75]They won't catch me
[02:10.08]I'm innocent
[02:13.68]They won't break me
[02:14.94]
[03:26.70]Some people got a chip on their shoulder
[03:30.18]An some would say it was me
[03:32.10]But I didn't buy that fifth of whisky
[03:34.97]That you gave me
[03:36.65]So I'd be quick to disagree
[03:38.35]
[03:39.45]They're out ta get me
[03:42.66]They won't catch me
[03:44.79]I'm fucking innocent
[03:49.55]They won't break me
[03:52.96]They're out to get me
[03:56.14]They won't catch me
[03:59.33]I'm innocent
[04:03.04]So you can
[04:04.05]Suck me
[04:06.43]Take that one to heart
[04:10.30]
