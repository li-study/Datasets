[00:43.42]All this time, how could I know
[00:50.36]Within these walls, I can feel you
[00:55.62]
[00:57.37]Another day goes by,
[01:00.80]will never know just wonder why
[01:04.39]You made me feel good, made me smile
[01:11.43]I see it now, and I, can say it's gone
[01:16.42]That would be a lie
[01:18.45]Cannot control this, this thing called love
[01:26.76]
[01:30.10]You must think, how can this be
[01:38.06]You don't really know me

[02:40.53]
[02:43.70]Always have to move on,
[02:47.93]To leave it all behind
