[00:05.00]Great big white world-Manilyn Manson 伟大的白人社会（玛丽莲·曼森）
[00:23.78]In space the stars are no nearer.
[00:29.77]They just glitter like a morgue.
[00:35.94]And I dreamed I was a spaceman.
[00:38.70]Burned like a moth in a flame.
[00:41.59]And our world was so fucking gone.
[00:46.00]
[00:57.19]I'm not attached 2 Ur world.
[01:02.82]Nothing heals & nothing grows.
[01:08.62]I'm not attached 2 Ur world.
[01:14.16]Nothing heals & nothing grows.
[01:20.57]Because it's a great big white world.
[01:26.59]And we are drained of our colors.
[01:33.44]We used 2 love ourselves.
[01:38.19]We used 2 love one another.
[01:45.67]All my stitches itch.
[01:48.15]My prescription's low.
[01:52.00]I wish U were queen just 4 today.
[01:57.12]In a world so white what else could I say?
[02:08.46]
[02:14.06]And hell was so cold.
[02:16.53]All the vases are so broken.
[02:19.42]And the roses tear our hands all open.
[02:25.20]Mother mary miscarry.
[02:28.00]But we pray just like insects.
[02:31.04]The world is so ugly now.
[02:36.11]Because it's a great big white world.
[02:41.58]And we are drained of our colors.
[02:48.81]We used 2 love ourselves.
[02:53.33]We used 2 love one another.
[03:00.57]All my stitches itch my prescription's low.
[03:06.37]I wish U were queen just 4 today.
[03:11.69]All my stitches itch my prescription's low.
[03:17.45]I wish U were queen just 4 today.
[03:23.53]In a world so white what else could I say?
[03:31.15]And we are drained of our colors.
[03:40.81]We used 2 love ourselves.
[03:45.27]We used 2 love one another.
[04:06.00]
[04:22.14]All my stitches itch my prescription's low.
[04:27.72]I wish U were queen just 4 today.
[04:33.10]All my stitches itch my prescription's low.
[04:38.94]I wish U were queen just 4 today.
[04:44.82]In a world so white what else could I say?
