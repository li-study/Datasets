[00:05.72]Song: Wide Open Space Lyrics
[00:07.63]I'm in a wide open space,
[00:11.28]I'm standing
[00:13.17]
[00:13.58]I'm all alone and staring into space
[00:21.02]It's always quiet thru' my ceiling
[00:27.57]The roof comes in and crashes in a daze
[00:34.86]
[00:35.38]I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
[00:41.41]You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me
[00:49.04]I'm in a wide open space, I'm staring
[00:55.25]There's something quite bizarre I cannot see
[01:02.46]
[01:03.23]I'm on the top of a hill, I'm lonely
[01:09.08]There's someone here to shout to miles away
[01:16.57]I could be back in my house, for I care
[01:23.08]They do not hear me, it's the same old case
[01:30.15]
[01:30.67]I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
[01:37.06]You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me
[01:39.91]I'm in a wide open space, I'm staring
[01:50.41]There's something quite bizarre I cannot see
[01:57.91]
[02:40.79]Wide open space, I'm standing
[02:46.43]I'm all alone and staring into space
[02:53.87]It's always quiet thru' my ceiling
[03:00.25]The roof comes in and crashes in a daze
[03:07.85]
[03:08.20]I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
[03:14.38]You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me
[03:22.12]I'm in a wide open space, I'm staring
[03:28.52]There's something quite bizarre I cannot see
[03:35.61]
[03:36.09]I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
[03:42.27]You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me
[03:49.75]I'm in a wide open space, I'm staring
[03:55.72]There's something quite bizarre I cannot see
