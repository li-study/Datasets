[00:14.62]Lyric by Jason
[00:16.00]
[00:18.39]You’re living in a place you lived behind
[00:23.11]Going round in circles all the time
[00:28.20]Can see the way your head it's like you’re blind
[00:33.29]So open your eyes and
[00:35.81]Time realign just what you got
[00:40.63]With what you nearly had and what you want
[00:45.63]You fall asleep and then the moment’s gone
[00:50.58]So open your eyes and…
[00:53.80]
[00:54.19](K'Naan, rap)
[01:03.63]
[01:03.88]Looking back
[01:06.52]You always seem to be looking back
[01:11.29]Feels like your mind’s always somewhere else
[01:15.76]You’re always looking over your shoulder
[01:21.20]
[01:21.55]Think about the places you could never been
[01:25.84]Beauty in the faces that you never see
[01:30.95]As you lad sleepy
[01:33.43]How the moment flies
[01:35.69]So open your eyes and…
[01:39.94]
[01:40.22](K'Naan, rap)
[01:43.87]
[01:44.08]Don’t waste your time, no
[01:46.14]Don’t waste your time just looking back
[01:51.44]You always seem to be looking back
[01:56.49]Feels like your mind’s always somewhere else
[02:01.50]You’re always looking over your shoulder
[02:06.23]Looking back
[02:09.03]You always seem to be looking back
[02:13.92]Feels like your mind’s always somewhere else
[02:18.87]You’re always looking over your shoulder
[02:23.81]
[02:23.99](K’Naan, rap)
[02:49.02]
[02:49.19]Don’t waste your time just looking back
[02:53.99]You always seem to be looking back
[02:58.99]Feels like your mind’s always somewhere else
[03:03.98]You’re always looking over your shoulder
[03:11.10]You always seem to be looking back
[03:16.56]Feels like your mind’s always somewhere else
[03:21.16]You’re always looking over your shoulder
[03:26.31]
[03:30.25]You’re always looking back
[03:33.82]Over, and over, and over
[03:39.62]You’re always looking back
[03:42.69]
