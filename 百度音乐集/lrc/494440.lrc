[00:01.00]Disturbed - Asylum
[00:02.71]
[00:20.22]Release me!
[00:21.70]
[00:32.38]No remnants were ever found of it;
[00:34.86]Feeling the hot bile, with every fake smile.
[00:37.65]Though no evidence was ever found,
[00:39.67]It never went away completely...
[00:42.71]I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
[00:45.47]Another day gone, another night's dawn;
[00:48.35]Dark forces pull me underground
[00:50.27]They never went away completely!
[00:53.40]How can I feel this empty?
[00:57.35]I will not recover this time;
[01:00.87]This loneliness is killing me...YAH!
[01:07.24]
[01:14.76]Will I never know peace of mind again?
[01:17.51]I don't believe it, I can't achieve it.
[01:20.21]I think you know it's just another sign
[01:22.32]It never went away completely.
[01:25.20]Terror is coursing in me, (Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on everything...)
[01:29.55]Dreading the final moment when I have to dream,
[01:32.91](Keeps a feeble hold on my belief - just waiting for the moment when I...)
[01:34.58]And feel you DIE!
[01:36.79]In Asylum - I live a lie
[01:38.91]Don't you know I'm in love with you,
[01:40.91]And I wasn't ready
[01:42.26]For Asylum - Relive a lie to let go -
[01:45.14]Now it's dragging me into your grave
[01:47.32]Your Asylum - forget the lie!
[01:49.58]Overcome by the feeling that
[01:51.49]I won't get to join you in time,
[01:54.13]For the loneliness is killing me... YAH!
[02:00.54]
[02:08.10]Death's images are all around again;
[02:10.83]They're right behind me, they're gonna find me!
[02:13.57]Judgment for the immortal sin
[02:15.61]That had enveloped me completely... YAH!
[02:18.96]I know I'll never know a peaceful night again;
[02:21.42]Afraid they'll hear me - they don't fear me
[02:24.25]Punishment for the immoral crime --
[02:26.24]The debt was never paid completely
[02:28.79]
[02:29.40]Terror is coursing in me, (Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on everything...)
[02:32.57]Dreading the final moment when I have to dream,
[02:35.35](Keeps a feeble hold on my belief - just waiting for the moment when I...)
[02:38.09]And feel you DIE!
[02:40.86]In Asylum - I live a lie
[02:42.98]Don't you know I'm in love with you,
[02:44.77]And I wasn't ready
[02:46.06]For Asylum - Relive a lie to let go -
[02:49.07]Now it's dragging me into your grave
[02:51.47]Your Asylum - forget the lie!
[02:53.66]Overcome by the feeling that
[02:55.45]I won't get to join you in time,
[02:58.24]For the loneliness is killing me... YAH!
[03:04.34]
[03:12.29]In the end there will be no suffering! (More suffering!)
[03:16.42]In the end you will find out everything! (Not anything!)
[03:20.04]In the end you may question your belief! (What belief?)
[03:24.21]In the end you will realize finally -
[03:27.03]- how you were deceived!
[03:30.08]
[03:31.10]This has gone on too long! (too long...)
[03:36.50]No more demonic dreams!
[03:40.04]
[03:41.83]Destroyer, come tonight
[03:45.47]Because the memory is killing me!
[03:54.04]
[03:55.65]In Asylum - I live a lie I let go,
[03:58.52]Now it's dragging me into your grave
[04:00.89]For Asylum - relive the lie!
[04:02.99]Overcome by the feeling that
[04:04.80]I won't get to join you in time (not a chance!)
[04:07.82]This world is not fulfilling me... YAH!
[04:13.72]
[04:16.22]Don't need to live in Asylum - I'll live a lie
[04:21.27]Don't want to live in Asylum - I'll live a lie
[04:26.18]Don't need to live in Asylum - I'll live a lie
[04:31.50]
