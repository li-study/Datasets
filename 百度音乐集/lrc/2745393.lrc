[00:14.91]It's not the same when I look in her eyes.
[00:20.72]The magic's not there.
[00:25.09]And when I look, I realize
[00:30.94]What we could have shared.
[00:42.25]I'm always gonna love you
[00:47.39]If loving means forever.
[00:51.68]I'm always gonna want you.
[00:56.50]I don't think I could ever
[01:00.65]Just forget the love we had.
[01:09.76]It's not the same when she's here in my arms
[01:14.86]Or the smile on her face.
[01:19.81]And even though with all of her charms
[01:25.47]She can't take your place.
[01:35.43]I'm always gonna love you
[01:40.49]If loving means forever.
[01:46.04]I'm always gonna want you.
[01:49.92]I don't think I could ever
[01:54.89]Just forget the love we had.
[02:48.96]It's not the same when I look in her eyes.
[02:54.67]The magic's not there.
[02:59.38]And when I look, I realize
[03:04.89]What we could have shared.
[03:10.18]I'm always gonna love you
[03:14.58]If loving means forever.
[03:19.60]I'm always gonna want you
[03:25.17]If loving means forever.
[03:30.06]I'm always gonna love you
[03:34.55]If loving means forever.
[03:40.02]I'm always gonna want you
[03:44.54]If loving means forever.
[03:49.94]I'm always gonna love you.
