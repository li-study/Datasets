[00:03.56]Welcome to a demonstration
[00:05.06]of 3-dimensional sound.
[00:07.14]In order to achieve
[00:08.34]the most convincing effect,
[00:10.15]we advise you
[00:10.97]to close your eyes.
[00:12.70]The sound you are about to hear
[00:14.39]has been recorded
[00:15.25]using binaural technique.
[00:17.46]Binaural technique differs
[00:19.05]from mono,stereo,
[00:20.47]and surround sound recordings
[00:22.18]in that you can determine
[00:23.32]the exact distance
[00:24.63]and direction of a given sound.
[00:27.32]For instance,
[00:28.25]if I walk around you,
[00:29.96]you will be able to
[00:31.60]locate my voice
[00:32.50]while I am talking to you.
[00:34.58]And if I drop my keys
[00:37.17]and pick them up,
[00:40.68]you can determine
[00:41.82]whether my voice
[00:42.98]is coming from below,
[00:43.98]or from a source
[00:45.38]that is right next to you.
[00:48.05]By use of virtual sound sources,
[00:49.90]a variety of effects
[00:51.36]can be applied
[00:52.94]enhancing your experience
[00:54.16]of being in a different place.
[00:57.63]In addition to the effects conveyed
[00:59.64]by the separate sound sources
[01:01.37]all kinds of atmospheres
[01:02.82]can be created,
[01:04.08]wrapping you up
[01:05.15]in a virtual environment.
[01:09.13]"It can be noisy."
[01:11.62]"Ok this is about an hour?"
[01:18.57]Or meditative.
[01:23.10]It can be almost anything
[01:24.30]you wanted to be.
[01:25.65]Even a kiss.
[01:28.40]You now have a brief sample of
[01:29.68]how the 3-D synthesis can be
[01:31.83]used in a musical context.
[01:36.44]The special and movable sound scene
[01:38.51]gives you a pleasant, relaxing,
[01:40.15]almost meditative experience.
[01:43.29]Close your eyes.
[01:44.66]Lean back in a comfortable chair
[01:46.38]and set your imagination free.
