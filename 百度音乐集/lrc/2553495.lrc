[00:13.50]Hey where did we go,
[00:16.50]Days when the rains came
[00:20.50]Down in the hollow,
[00:23.50]Playin' a new game,
[00:26.50]Laughing and a running hey, hey
[00:30.50]Skipping and a jumping
[00:33.50]In the misty morning fog with
[00:36.50]Our hearts a thumpin' and you
[00:41.50]My brown eyed girl,
[00:42.50]
[00:45.50]You my brown eyed girl.
[00:49.50]
[00:52.50]Whatever happened
[00:55.50]To Tuesday and so slow
[00:58.50]Going down the old mind
[01:01.50]With a transistor radio
[01:05.50]Standing in the sunlight laughing,
[01:08.50]Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,
[01:12.50]Slipping and sliding
[01:14.50]All along the water fall, with you
[01:19.50]My brown eyed girl,
[01:21.50]
[01:24.50]You my brown eyed girl.
[01:27.50]
[01:29.50]Do you remember when
[01:33.50]we used to sing,
[01:34.50]Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
[01:40.50]Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
[01:45.50]la te da.
[01:47.50]
[01:59.50]So hard to find my way,
[02:02.50]Now that I'm all on my own.
[02:06.50]I saw you just the other day,
[02:09.50]My how you have grown,
[02:12.50]Cast my memory back there, Lord
[02:15.50]Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
[02:18.50]Making love in the green grass
[02:21.50]Behind the stadium with you
[02:26.50]My brown eyed girl
[02:28.50]
[02:31.50]You my brown eyed girl
[02:34.50]
[02:36.50]Do you remember when
[02:39.50]we used to sing
[02:40.50]Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
[02:46.50]Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
[02:53.50]Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
