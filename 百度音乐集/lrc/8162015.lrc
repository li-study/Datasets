[01:09.74]Like a fever, fever - inside of me
[01:18.18]Like a fever, fever - inside of me
[01:25.37]Stand fast, faithful one
[01:28.87]See the moon and not the sun but I...
[01:34.12]All I need is a simple reminder
[01:41.81]Breakdown, frail affairs
[01:45.43]Turn from the elusive stares but I...
[01:50.69]All I need is a simple reminder
[01:54.63]
[02:07.50]Guilt is feeding, feeding - inside I'm cold
[02:15.76]Guilt is feeding, feeding - inside I'm cold
[02:23.14]In depth grasp the chains
[02:26.58]Struggle as the waters gain but I...
[02:31.89]All I need is a simple reminder
[02:39.45]Observe the formation
[02:42.79]Fight until the battle's won but I...
[02:48.09]All I need is a simple reminder
[02:52.43]
[03:12.34]There's no rule to say you'll cry alone
[03:20.47]Just find the strength to help you carry the load
[03:28.59]Reverse the frown and let the power surge
[03:37.03]But when alone you cannot resist the urge
[03:45.72]
[04:02.61]Can you feel it, feel it - like the pain of dying
[04:10.92]Can you feel it, feel it - like the pain of dying
[04:18.11]Hold on face to face
[04:21.69]Damaged by the sad disgrace but I...
[04:26.93]All I need is a simple reminder
[04:34.62]Twisting the knife in vain
[04:38.13]End the grief but who will gain but I...
[04:43.43]All I need is a simple excuse...
