[00:02.55]Nightwish
[00:04.14]
[01:02.65]Once there was a child`s dream
[01:07.70]One night the clock struck twelve
[01:09.53]The window open wide
[01:12.75]Once there was a child`s heart
[01:17.89]The age I learned to fly
[01:19.58]And took a step outside
[01:23.00]
[01:38.07]Once I knew all the tales
[01:43.17]It`s time to turn back time
[01:45.46]Follow the pale moonlight
[01:48.14]Once I wished for this night
[01:53.00]Faith brought me here
[01:54.40]It`s time to cut the rope and fly
[01:57.27]Fly to a dream
[01:59.05]Far across the sea
[02:01.59]All the burdens gone
[02:03.99]Open the chest once more
[02:06.76]Dark chest of wonders
[02:08.98]Seen through the eyes
[02:11.70]Of the one with pure heart
[02:15.50]Once so long ago
[02:20.35]
[02:29.81]The one in the Big Blue is
[02:36.77]what the world stole from me
[02:42.32]This night will bring him back to me
[02:56.63]
[03:12.55]Fly to a dream
[03:16.21]Far across the sea
[03:18.56]All the burdens gone
[03:21.04]Open the chest once more
[03:23.84]Dark chest of wonders
[03:26.06]Seen through the eyes
[03:28.78]Of the one with pure heart
[03:32.51]Once so long ago
[03:36.62]Fly to a dream
[03:38.98]Far across the sea
[03:41.29]All the burdens gone
[03:43.64]Open the chest once more
[03:46.59]Dark chest of wonders
[03:48.64]Seen through the eyes
[03:51.11]Of the one with pure heart
[03:55.33]Once so long ago
[04:00.39]
