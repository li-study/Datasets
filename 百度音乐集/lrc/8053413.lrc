[00:30.00]You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
[00:32.00]Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
[00:35.00]How? My last album was "The Chronic"

[01:57.00]In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
[02:00.00]Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
[02:02.00]I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E
[02:05.00]I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
