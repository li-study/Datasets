[00:01.93]When you told me you loved me
[00:02.93]Jessica Simpson
[00:05.20]
[00:08.51]Once
[00:11.72]Doesn't mean anything to me
[00:17.08]Come
[00:20.17]Show me the meaning of complete
[00:25.63]Where
[00:28.00]Did our love go wrong
[00:31.96]Once we were so strong
[00:36.82]How can I go on?
[00:42.15]When you told me you loved me
[00:44.59]Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
[00:50.95]to get over the feeling of knowing
[00:54.43]A dream didn't turn out right
[00:59.47]When you let me believe that you weren't complete
[01:04.55]Without me by your side
[01:07.86]how could I know
[01:09.93]That you would go
[01:12.03]That you would run
[01:14.21]Baby, I thought you were the one
[01:21.53]Why
[01:24.82]Can't I just leave it all behind
[01:30.12]I
[01:33.22]Felt passion so bright that I was blind
[01:38.95]Then
[01:40.83]Something made me weak
[01:45.23]Talking in my sleep
[01:50.09]Baby, I'm in so deep and you know I believed
[01:55.56]When you told me you loved me
[01:57.52]Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
[02:04.02]to get over the feeling of knowing
[02:07.57]A dream didn't turn out right
[02:12.77]When you let me believe that you weren't complete
[02:16.99]Without me by your side
[02:20.74]how could I know
[02:22.74]That you would go
[02:24.92]That you would run
[02:26.97]Baby, I thought you were the one
[02:32.70]
[02:35.55]Your lips
[02:37.94]Your face
[02:39.78]Something that time just can't erase
[02:44.18]Find my heart
[02:46.32]Could break
[02:48.18]All over again
[02:53.45]When you told me you loved me
[02:57.86]Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
[03:01.84]to get over the feeling of knowing
[03:05.43]A dream didn't turn out right
[03:10.44]When you let me believe that you weren't complete
[03:14.56]Without me by your side
[03:18.67]how could I know
[03:20.59]That you would go
[03:22.77]That you would run
[03:24.87]Baby, I thought you were the one
[03:30.13]Why
[03:33.45]
