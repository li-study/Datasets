[00:13.65]George Michael: ROXANNE
[01:26.19][00:39.32]Roxanne,
[01:31.52][00:45.04]You don't have to put on the red light.
[00:53.59]Those days are over,
[00:56.48]You don't have to sell your body to the night.
[01:02.95]Roxanne,
[01:08.17]You don't have to wear that dress tonight.
[01:16.37]Walk the streets for money,
[01:20.35]You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right.
[02:01.59]I loved you since I knew you.
[02:07.68]I wouldn't talk down to you.
[02:13.48]I have to tell you just how I feel.
[02:18.49]I won't share you with another boy.
[02:25.41]I know my mind is made up,
[02:30.83]So put away your make up.
[02:36.28]I told you once, I won't tell you again.
[02:41.96]It's a bad way.
[01:38.64]Roxanne,
[01:43.26]You don't have to...
[02:47.25]Roxanne,
[02:51.48]You don't have to put on the red light.
[02:59.24]Roxanne,
[03:01.17]Don't you know, you dong't have to...
[03:52.15][03:39.81][03:28.15]Baby, don't put it on.
