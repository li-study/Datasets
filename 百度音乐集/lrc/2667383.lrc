[00:12.30]Joyse，I am missing U — Mike0532
[00:14.14]
[00:20.12]Used to be so easy to give my heart away.
[00:29.59]But I found out the hard way,
[00:32.62]there's a price you have to pay.
[00:38.20]I found out that love was no friend of mine.
[00:48.12]I should have known time after time.
[00:56.33]So long, it was so long ago,
[01:03.85]but I've still got the blues for you.
[01:14.48]Used to be so easy to fall in love again.
[01:23.68]But I found out the hard way,
[01:26.44]it's a road that leads to pain.
[01:32.40]I found that love was more than just a game.
[01:41.36]You're playin' to win, but you lose just the same.
[01:50.16]So long, it was so long ago,
[01:57.84]but I've still got the blues for you.
[02:07.99]So many years since I've seen your face.
[02:17.08]Here in my heart, there's an empty space
[02:24.25]where you used to be.
[03:05.68]So long, it was so long ago,
[03:12.84]but I've still got the blues for you.
[03:22.04]Though the days come and go,
[03:26.20]there is one thing I know.
[03:30.93]I've still got the blues for you
