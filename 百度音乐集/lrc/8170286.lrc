[00:09.81]Don't tell me to stop
[00:14.69]Tell the rain not to drop
[00:19.45]Tell the wind not to blow
[00:23.39]'Cause you said so, mmm
[00:29.48]
[00:29.68]Tell the sun not to shine
[00:33.04]Not to get up this time, no, no
[00:39.11]Let it fall by the way
[00:42.59]But don't leave me where I lay down
[00:48.59]
[00:57.64]Tell me love isn't true
[01:01.83]It's just something that we do
[01:07.29]Tell me everything I'm not
[01:11.78]But please don't tell me to stop
[01:17.43]But don't ever tell me to stop
[01:17.78]
[01:17.98]Tell the leaves not to turn
[01:20.97]But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no
[01:27.29]Take the black off a crow
[01:30.66]But don't tell me I have to go
[01:36.65]
[01:37.31]Tell the bed not to lay
[01:40.23]Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
[01:46.46]Not to stare up at me
[01:49.63]Like a calf down on it's knees
[01:55.07]
[01:55.27]Tell me love isn't true
[01:59.84]It's just something that we do
[02:05.39]Tell me everything I'm not
[02:10.37]But don't ever tell me to stop
[02:13.61]
[02:13.81](Don't you ever)
[02:15.48]Tell me love isn't true
[02:19.18]It's just something that we do
[02:23.88](Don't you ever)
[02:24.96]Tell me everything I'm not
[02:29.06]But don't ever tell me to stop
[02:32.89]
[02:33.09](Don't you ever)
[02:33.17]
[02:34.62]Please don't
[02:36.70]Please don't
[02:39.21]Please don't tell me to stop
[02:42.87]
[02:43.05](Don't you ever)
[02:44.21]Don't you ever
[02:48.84]Don't ever tell me to stop
[02:51.80]
[02:52.00](Tell the rain not to drop)
[02:54.27]Tell the bed not to lay
[02:57.89]Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
[03:03.88]Not to stare up at me
[03:07.15]Like a calf down on it's knees
[03:12.99]
