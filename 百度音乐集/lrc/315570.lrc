[00:00.00]
[00:15.19]I will not make the same mistakes that you did
[00:22.22]I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
[00:29.43]I will not break the way you did you fell so hard
[00:36.58]I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
[00:43.26]
[00:43.71]Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[00:50.93]Because of you I learned to play on the safe side
[00:54.98]So I don't get hurt
[00:57.92]Because of you I find it hard to trust
[01:01.61]Not only me, but everyone around me
[01:05.47]Because of you I am afraid
[01:12.21]
[01:14.26]I lose my way And it's not too long before you point it out
[01:21.15]I cannot cry Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
[01:28.46]I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh Every day of my life
[01:35.55]My heart can't possibly break
[01:38.43]When it wasn't even whole to start with
[01:42.37]
[01:42.82]Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[01:49.92]Because of you I learned to play on the safe side
[01:53.92]So I don't get hurt
[01:57.09]Because of you I find it hard to trust
[02:00.59]Not only me, but everyone around me
[02:04.52]Because of you I am afraid
[02:11.06]
[02:11.60]I watched you die I heard you cry
[02:15.02]Every night in your sleep
[02:17.94]I was so young
[02:20.42]You should have known better than to lean on me
[02:25.87]You never thought of anyone else you just saw your pain
[02:33.42]And now I cry In the middle of the night For the same damn thing
[02:43.79]
[02:45.68]Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[02:52.12]Because of you I learned to play on the safe side
[02:57.00]So I don't get hurt
[02:59.76]Because of you I find it hard to trust
[03:03.52]Not only me, but everyone around me
[03:07.28]Because of you I am afraid
[03:13.01]
[03:18.12]Because of you
[03:25.31]Because of you
[03:33.96]
