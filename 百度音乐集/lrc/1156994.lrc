[00:07.88]
[00:12.57]My favorite addiction
[00:17.10]You're no good to me
[00:19.90]But all this attraction
[00:24.13]Makes it hard to see
[00:26.99]The line between what's right
[00:32.54]And what I wanna do
[00:37.26]So I've got to tell you
[00:40.65]
[00:41.04]I'm gonna pack my bags
[00:42.97]Leave a lipstick letter
[00:44.62]Take the first plane out of town
[00:48.19]I can't lie, I won't cry
[00:50.33]I won't tell you goodbye
[00:52.17]And I won't turn around
[00:55.79]You're gonna be a sweet memory
[00:58.73]But you'll never be Mr. Right

[01:27.13]When your lips touch me
[01:29.64]I just can't breathe
[01:34.05]But deep inside I know
[01:36.40]This can't work out
[01:40.27]So any day now
[01:43.63]
[01:44.08]I'm gonna pack my bags
[01:45.95]Leave a lipstick letter

[01:51.30]I can't lie, I won't cry
[01:53.35]I won't tell you goodbye
[01:55.21]And I won't turn around
[01:58.32]You're gonna be a sweet memory
[02:01.80]But you'll never be Mr. Right
[02:05.11]I'm gonna leave you baby
[02:07.53]Yeah, someday I'll leave you baby
[02:11.36]Just not tonight

[02:17.73]And baby, it feels like paradise
[02:21.02]You know I need to leave you
[02:23.19]But I can't leave you, I can't leave you now
