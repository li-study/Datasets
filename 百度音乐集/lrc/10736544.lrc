[00:15.00]Welcome to communicate with me
[00:18.00]
[00:36.33]Come with me
[00:37.25]Let me walk in through the world that I currently stay in
[00:38.88]You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken
[00:41.95]You can even talk to everybody that I live with
[00:44.98]Maybe you could tell me why everybody's so distant
[00:48.01]Is it me or maybe, when I look around daily
[00:50.79]I don't even know the people I can put my trust in lately
[00:53.78]People that I used to hang with now their actin' so different
[00:56.69]I'm still the same person why doesn't anybody listen
[00:59.51]Can somebody please just explain to me
[01:03.01]What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
[01:05.40]Right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
[01:08.91]And I'm losin' hope
[01:09.50]
[01:10.45]Deafening voices
[01:14.54]That frequency inside my head that says
[01:20.12]I'm going at it the hard way I focus
[01:26.00]Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
[01:32.00]I'm going at it the hard way
[01:34.00]
[01:35.02]Come with me
[01:35.65]Let me walk in through the world that I currently live in
[01:38.70]Not a thing is forgotten, not a thing is forgiven
[01:42.03]Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight but
[01:44.96]Nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes so
[01:48.00]What do you do when somebody lets you down
[01:50.84]And you wanna say something but you canâ€™t cause their not around
[01:53.70]Inside you think they know the extent of the pain
[01:57.01]But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame
[01:59.77]Can somebody please just explain to me
[02:03.00]What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
[02:05.83]Cause right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
[02:09.03]And I'm losin' hope
[02:09.50]
[02:10.45]Deafening voices
[02:14.54]That frequency inside my head that says
[02:20.12]I'm going at it the hard way I focus
[02:26.08]Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
[02:32.81]I'm going at it the hard way
[02:35.00]Voices Voices in my head
[02:48.09]Can somebody please just explain to me
[02:50.48]What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
[02:54.01]Right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
[02:57.12]And I'm losin' hope, give me one reason not to
[02:59.45]Voices
[03:02.54]That frequency inside my head that says
[03:08.12]I'm going at it the hard way I focus
[03:14.08]Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
[03:20.81]I'm going at it the hard way
[03:30.00]
[03:40.00]The End
