[00:36.24]In that big big house there are fifty doors
[00:40.62]and one of them leads to your heart.
[00:44.57]In the time of spring I passed your gate
[00:49.08]and tried to make a start.
[00:53.39]All I knew
[00:57.01]was the scent of sea and dew
[01:02.13]but I've been in love before,
[01:04.76]how about you?
[01:10.73]There's a time for the good in life,
[01:14.05]a time to kill the pain in life,
[01:19.11]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[01:30.49]In that big old house there are fifty beds
[01:35.04]and one of them leads to your soul.
[01:38.91]It's a bed of fear,
[01:41.24]a bed of threats, regrets and sheets so cold.
[01:47.86]All I knew
[01:51.45]your eyes so velvet blue,
[01:56.71]I've been in love before,
[01:59.40]how about you?
[02:05.05]There's a time for the good in life,
[02:08.47]a time to kill the pain in life,
[02:13.39]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[02:21.41]It's time to place you bets in life,
[02:25.39]I've played the loser's game of life,
[02:30.29]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[02:58.87]Time went by as I wrote yor name in the sky,
[03:08.01]fly fly away, bye bye.
[03:28.92]It's time to place you bets in life,
[03:32.35]I've played the loser's game of life,
[03:37.26]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[03:45.39]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[03:54.09]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
[04:02.42]dream about the sun you queen of rain.
