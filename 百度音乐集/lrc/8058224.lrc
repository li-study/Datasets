[00:02.50]Someone'S Watching Over Me
[00:04.97]hilary duff
[00:06.81]
[00:09.46]Found myself today, oh I found myself and ran away
[00:21.84]Something pulled me back, voice of reason I forgot I had
[00:31.39]All I know is you're not here to say what you always used to say
[00:38.91]But it's written in the sky tonight
[00:45.65]So I won't give up, no I won't break down
[00:52.10]Sooner than it seems life turns around
[00:58.22]And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
[01:04.49]When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
[01:11.14]Someone's watching over me
[01:18.94]Seen that red light, and it's shining on my destiny
[01:28.39]Shining all the time, and I won't be afraid
[01:35.05]To follow everywhere it's taking me
[01:40.99]All I know is yesterday is gone, and right now I belong
[01:48.78]To this moment to my dreams
[01:54.84]So I won't give up, no I won't break down
[02:01.41]Sooner than it seems life turns around
[02:07.43]And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
[02:13.64]When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
[02:20.20]Someone's watching over me
[02:25.40]It doesn't matter what people say
[02:28.07]And it doesn't matter how long it takes
[02:31.12]For leaving yourself and you'll find
[02:38.21]And it only matters how true you are
[02:41.72]Be true to yourself and follow your heart
[02:49.06]So I won't give up, no I won't break down
[02:55.41]Sooner than it seems life turns around
[03:01.67]And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
[03:07.75]When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
[03:14.15]That I won't give up, no I won't break down
[03:20.52]Sooner than it seems life turns around
[03:26.78]And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
[03:32.91]When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
[03:39.30]That someone's watching over, someone's watching over
[03:46.04]someone's watching over me
[03:51.12]Yeah yeah
[03:53.07]Oh oh someone's watching over me
