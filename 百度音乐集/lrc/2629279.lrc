[00:39.84]Tell her I'll be waiting
[00:43.45]In the usual place
[00:46.79]With the tired and weary
[00:49.78]And there's no escape
[00:51.01]
[00:53.88]To need a women
[00:56.65]You've got to know
[00:59.75]How the strong get weak
[01:02.80]And the rich get poor
[01:03.85]
[01:04.94]Slave to love
[01:05.46]Oh oh, slave to love
[01:07.45]
[01:19.37]You're running with me
[01:22.60]Don't touch the ground
[01:26.29]We're the restless hearted
[01:29.34]Not the chained and bound
[01:31.08]
[01:32.99]The sky is burning
[01:36.39]A sea of flame
[01:39.24]Though your world is changing
[01:42.23]I will be the same
[01:43.40]
[01:44.24]Slave to love
[01:44.76]Oh oh, slave to love
[01:56.67]Slave to love
[02:06.13]And I can't escape
[02:08.25]I'm a slave to love
[02:09.16]
[02:24.68]Can you help me ?
[02:27.58]Oh oh, can you help me ?
[02:28.63]
[02:50.95]The storm is breaking
[02:54.29]Or so it seems we're too young to reason
[03:01.19]Too grown to dream
[03:02.54]
[03:03.89]Now spring is turning your face to mine
[03:10.34]I can hear your laughter
[03:13.33]I can see your smile
