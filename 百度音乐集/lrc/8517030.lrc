[00:04.30]
[00:05.39]UpLoaded By walter scofield
[00:07.03]
[00:12.68]Your subtleties
[00:15.14]They strangle me
[00:17.82]I can't explain myself at all.
[00:23.28]And all that wants
[00:27.16]And all that needs
[00:28.58]All I don't want u to need at all.
[00:33.48]
[00:34.07]The walls start breathing
[00:36.51]My minds unweaving
[00:39.91]Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
[00:44.74]A weight is lifted
[00:47.62]On this evening
[00:50.67]I give the final blow.
[00:52.13]
[00:54.09]When darkness turns to light,
[00:57.48]It ends tonight
[01:00.39]It ends tonight.
[01:03.76]
[01:07.13]A falling star
[01:09.21]Least I fall alone.
[01:12.24]I can't explain what you can't explain.
[01:17.82]Your finding things that you didn't know
[01:22.71]I look at you with such disdain
[01:27.92]
[01:28.67]The walls start breathing
[01:31.59]My minds unweaving
[01:35.02]Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
[01:39.67]A weight is lifted
[01:42.74]On this evening
[01:45.70]I give the final blow.
[01:48.52]
[01:49.05]When darkness turns to light
[01:52.48]It ends tonight,
[01:55.06]It ends tonight.
[01:58.02]Just a little insight will make this right
[02:03.53]It's too late to fight
[02:06.03]It ends tonight,
[02:08.86]It ends tonight.
[02:12.56]
[02:13.20]Now I'm on my own side
[02:18.04]It's better than being on your side
[02:24.10]It's my fault when your blind
[02:29.11]It's better that I see it through your eyes
[02:34.06]
[02:35.14]All these thoughts locked inside
[02:40.63]Now you're the first to know
[02:43.86]When darkness turns to light
[02:47.52]It ends tonight,
[02:50.33]It ends tonight.
[02:53.39]Just a little insight will make this right
[02:58.74]It's too late to fight
[03:01.74]It ends tonight,
[03:04.36]It ends tonight.
[03:06.03]When darkness turns to light
[03:09.49]It ends tonight,
[03:12.17]It ends tonight.
[03:15.20]Just a little insight will make this right
[03:20.43]It's too late to fight
[03:23.37]It ends tonight,
[03:26.62]It ends tonight.
[03:44.55]When darkness turns to light
[03:48.53]It ends tonight,
