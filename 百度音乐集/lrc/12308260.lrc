[00:42.21]Who's to say you’re never wrong
[00:45.50]Who's to say that I’m not already gone
[00:51.53]Who's to say the time inside your head
[00:56.47]Keeps running on and on and on and on
[01:00.60]
[01:02.74]Who's to say we’ll make it through
[01:06.50]Starting to believe that what we think is never true
[01:13.08]And who's to say the rhymes beside your bed
[01:17.37]Will keep you warm when everything is getting colder
[01:22.25]And I’m just holding on until it’s over
[01:27.55]
[01:28.84]Mayday
[01:31.97]Somebody save me now
[01:37.22]I’m closing my eyes
[01:40.49]‘Cause once the sun rises
[01:42.31]It’s out of my hands
[01:45.33]
[01:48.05]It’s out of my hands
[01:50.60]
[01:55.85]Who's to say this history
[01:59.36]Isn’t only just some winter's distant memory
[02:05.71]You can’t escape this drying ink
[02:09.32]The fall of who we are is getting closer
[02:15.30]And I’m just holding on until it’s over
[02:20.04]
[02:21.66]Mayday
[02:24.33]Somebody save me now
[02:30.46]I’m cutting all ties
[02:33.39]From the world outside
[02:34.95]‘Cause it’s over my head
[02:38.69]
[02:39.87]It’s all coming undone
[02:45.84]And falling apart somehow
[02:51.24]I’m closing my eyes
[02:54.01]‘Cause once the sun rises
[02:56.38]It’s out of my hands
[02:59.72]Oh it’s out of my hands
[03:04.37]
[03:12.76]The light pulls me under
[03:17.41]And I keep on caving in
[03:22.49]
[03:24.29]Mayday
[03:28.29]Somebody save me now
[03:32.99]I’m cutting all ties
[03:35.86]From the world outside
[03:38.04]'Cause it’s over my head
[03:40.45]My head My head
[03:43.11]It’s all coming undone
[03:47.30]And falling apart somehow
[03:53.31]And I’m closing my eyes
[03:56.91]‘Cause once the sun rises
[03:59.17]It’s out of my hands
[04:02.35]Oh it’s out of my hands
