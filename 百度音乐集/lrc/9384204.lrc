[00:07.91][00:16.45][05:00.96]
[00:21.28]Tough, you think you've got the stuff
[00:31.24]You're telling me and anyone
[00:36.24]You're hard enough
[00:41.22]You don't have to put up a fight
[00:46.20]You don't have to always be right
[00:52.34]Let me take some of the punches
[00:56.02]For you tonight
[01:03.89][02:23.53]Listen to me now
[01:08.56][02:28.28]I need to let you know
[01:13.57][02:33.32]You don't have to go it alone
[01:20.46][02:40.17][03:57.28]And it's you when I look in the mirror
[01:25.32][02:44.96]And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
[01:30.84][02:50.49][04:07.67][04:27.59]Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[01:40.97]We fight all the time
[01:50.21]You and I...that's alright
[01:55.78]We're the same soul
[02:00.21]I don't need...I don't need to hear you say
[02:10.58]That if we weren't so alike
[02:15.08]You'd like me a whole lot more
[03:03.92]I know that we don't talk
[03:08.01]I'm sick of it all
[03:12.82]Can - you - hear - me - when - I -
[03:18.16]Sing, you're the reason I sing
[03:28.12]You're the reason why the opera is in me...
[03:37.20]Where are we now?
[03:41.49]I've got to let you know
[03:45.43]A house still doesn't make a home
[03:49.99]Don't leave me here alone...
[04:02.16]And it's you that makes it hard to let go
[04:17.72]Sometimes you can't make it
[04:22.01]The best you can do is to fake it
[04:35.68][04:37.45]
