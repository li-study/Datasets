[00:15.38]
[00:21.90]I'm missing you
[00:24.71]Girl even though you're right here by my side
[00:32.91]Cause lately it seems
[00:35.99]The distance between us is growing too wide
[00:43.87]I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over
[00:48.96]The last thing that I wanna hear
[03:22.97][00:54.37]
[03:44.12][03:26.96][02:11.42][00:56.48]If your heart's not in it for real
[03:50.02][03:32.70][02:17.46][01:02.22]Please don'`t try to fake what you don't feel
[03:55.50][02:22.80][01:07.57]If love's already gone
[03:58.26][02:25.62][01:10.61]It's not fair to lead me on
[04:01.40][02:28.58][01:13.48]Cause I would give the whole world for you
[04:07.31][02:34.30][01:19.61]Anything you ask of me I'd do
[03:37.94][02:40.11][01:24.89]But I won't ask you to stay
[03:40.94][02:43.20][01:27.78]I'd rather walk away
[02:46.35][01:31.13]If your heart's not in it
[04:12.74][01:34.98]
[01:39.45]You say that you love me
[01:42.80]But baby sometimes, you're just saying the words
[01:50.76]If you've got something to tell me
[01:54.17]Don't keep it inside
[01:57.20]Let it be heard
[02:01.81]I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over
[02:06.97]Girl I'll make it easy for you
[02:11.42]
[02:48.78]How I wish I could take us in time
[02:54.51]But it's gone too far now we can't rewind
[03:00.03]And there's nothing that I can do
[03:02.72]To stop me loding you
[03:04.97]I can't make you change your mind
[03:11.95]
[03:18.64]If your heart's not in it...
