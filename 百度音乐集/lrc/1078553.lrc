[00:45.22]I don't know how to live through this hell,
[00:48.18]Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell,
[00:51.14]Frozen soul, frozen down to the core,
[00:54.07]Break the ice, I can't take anymore
[00:56.00]
[00:57.14]Freezing,
[00:58.66]Can't move at all,
[01:00.08]Screaming,
[01:01.51]Can't hear my call,
[01:04.14]I am dying to live,
[01:06.05]Cry out,
[01:07.52]I'm trapped under ice
[01:10.02]
[01:20.92]Crystallized, as I lay here and rest,
[01:24.19]Eyes of glass stare directly at death,
[01:26.81]From deep sleep I have broken away,
[01:29.81]No one knows, no one hears what I say
[01:31:00]
[01:32.82]Freezing,
[01:34.25]Can't move at all,
[01:35.72]Screaming,
[01:37.21]Can't hear my call,
[01:39.55]I am dying to live,
[01:41.69]Cry out,
[01:43.18]I'm trapped under ice
[01:44.98]
[02:19.59][02:13.88]Scream from my soul,
[02:21.04][02:15.26]Fate, mystified,
[02:22.57][02:16.63]Hell, forever more
[02:24.41][02:18.63]
[03:06.57]No release from my cryonic state,
[03:09.49]What is this? I've been sticken by fate,
[03:12.41]Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free,
[03:15.24]Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
[03:29.00][03:18.00]
[03:30.42][03:18.59]Freezing,
[03:31.96][03:20.08]Can't move at all,
[03:33.37][03:21.50]Screaming
[03:34.87][03:23.01]Can't hear my call
[03:37.05][03:25.24]I am dying to live
[03:39.27][03:27.43]Cry out
[03:40.77][03:28.97]I'm trapped under the ice
[03:43.02]
