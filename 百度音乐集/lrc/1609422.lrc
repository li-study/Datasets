[00:18.00]Man it's a hot one
[00:21.00]Like seven inches from the midday sun
[00:26.00]I hear you whisper & the words melt everyone
[00:30.00]But you stay so cool
[00:34.00]My mu-equita, my Spanish harlem mona lisa
[00:42.00]Your my reason for reason
[00:47.00]The step in my groove
[00:51.00]And if you say this life ain't good enough
[00:55.00]I would give my world to lift you up
[01:00.00]I could change my life to better suit your mood
[01:08.00]Cause you're so smooth
[01:11.00]And just like the ocean under the moon
[01:17.00]Well that's the same emotion that I get from you
[01:21.00]You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
[01:25.00]Gimme your heart, make it real
[01:28.00]Or else forget about it
[01:36.00]I'll tell you one thing
[01:39.00]If you would leave it would be a crying shame
[01:43.00]In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
[01:51.00]Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
[01:59.00]You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
[02:06.00]Turning you round and round
[02:10.00]And if you say this life ain't good enough
[02:14.00]I would give my world to lift you up
[02:19.00]I could change my life to better suit your mood
[02:25.00]Cause you're so smooth
[02:32.00]And just like the ocean under the moon
[02:35.00]Well that's the same emotion that I get from you
[02:39.00]You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
[02:43.00]Gimme your heart, make it real
[02:47.00]Or else forget about it
[03:27.00]And just like the ocean under the moon
[03:32.00]Well that's the same emotion that I get from you
[03:36.00]You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
[03:40.00]Gimme your heart, make it real
[03:43.00]Or else forget about it
[03:50.00]Or else forget about it
[03:54.00]Or else forget about it
[03:56.00]Gimme your heart, make it real
[04:03.00]Or else forget about it
[04:07.00]Or else forget about it
