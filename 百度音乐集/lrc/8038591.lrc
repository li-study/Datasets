[00:20.89]To pretend no one can find,
[00:23.32]The fallacies of morning rose,
[00:26.31]Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes,
[00:28.72]Courtesies that I despise in me
[00:33.46]Take a ride, take a shot now.
[00:37.44]'Cause nobody loves me,
[00:40.64]It's true,
[00:44.51]Not like you do.
[00:56.65]Covered by the blind belief,
[00:59.28]That fantasies of sinful screens,
[01:01.89]Bear the facts, assume the dye,
[01:04.36]End the vows no need to lie, enjoy,
[01:09.16]Take a ride, take a shot now.
[01:13.00]'Cause nobody loves me,
[01:16.56]It's true,
[01:20.16]Not like you do.
[01:34.94]Who oo am I, what and why?
[01:37.43]'Cause all I have left is my memories of yesterday,
[01:43.86]Ohh these sour times.
[01:48.69]'Cause nobody loves me,
[01:52.26]It's true,
[01:55.95]Not like you do.
[02:08.28]After time the bitter taste,
[02:10.50]Of innocence decent or race,
[02:13.16]Scattered seed, buried lives,
[02:15.66]Mysteries of our disguise revolve,
[02:20.76]Circumstance will decide.
[02:24.60]'Cause nobody loves me,
[02:28.06]It's true,
[02:31.64]Not like you do
[03:00.12]'Cause nobody loves me,
[03:03.67]It's true,
[03:07.41]Not like you
[03:10.45]'Cause nobody loves me,
[03:13.52]It's true,
[03:17.19]Not like you do
