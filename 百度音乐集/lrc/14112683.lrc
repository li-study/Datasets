My mind's on rewind and quicksand.
(what?) I was up all night doing nothing.
(last night? again?)
Do you wanna stay in bed all day? (yeah!)
Do you remember feeling any other way? (no!)

I must've been sleeping when you called.
I'm not feeling well at all (cough, cough)
I got this thing that's been going around
Called please pretend that I'm out of town okay?
Do you wanna stay in bed all day...
I'll make some coffee, put on some eyeliner.
I think I'll find that things are fine and they're gonna get much finer!
Do you wanna stay in bed all day...
Hey look I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your party.
I know it looks like I'm gonna cry.
Got a to-do list behind my eyes so go tell your friends I'm still a feminist.
But I won't be coming to your benefit.
I give up.
I give up......I'll be at home today.
