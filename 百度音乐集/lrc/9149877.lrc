[00:22.03]Silence and quiet
[00:25.78]Again in my life
[00:29.59]Far from these moments
[00:32.68]I wish I was
[00:37.68]Passion and truth
[00:41.06]We were about
[00:44.80]Before these shadows
[00:48.39]Stole the beat of our hearts
[00:53.22]
[00:53.80]After all we have been through
[00:57.46]I can only look at you
[01:01.18]Through the eyes you lied to
[01:04.06]I'm givin' up, givin' up
[01:06.37]I'm givin' up on you
[01:08.82]After all if there is no way out
[01:12.59]If you cannot stand beside me
[01:16.71]If there isn't love
[01:18.13]There is only pride
[01:20.27]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
[01:24.47]
[01:29.29]Undo this leash
[01:32.83]You say I tied
[01:36.64]When only our fears are to
[01:39.98]blame this time
[01:45.00]And what am I to you
[01:48.21]Just spit it out
[01:51.89]I'm not afraid of the words that you hide
[01:59.73]
[02:01.07]After all we have been through
[02:04.65]I can only look at you
[02:08.49]Through the eyes you lied to
[02:11.10]I'm givin' up, givin' up
[02:13.55]I'm givin' up on you
[02:16.17]After all if there is no way out
[02:19.92]If you cannot stand beside me
[02:23.84]If there isn't love
[02:25.09]There is only pride
[02:27.32]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
[02:31.32]
[02:36.23]Where do we go
[02:40.12]Where did it all crash
[02:43.65]When did it start to fall apart
[02:49.62]
[02:53.20]Silence and quiet
[02:56.51]Passion, the truth
[03:00.21]Shadows, only shadows
[03:04.34]
[03:07.99]After all if there is no way out
[03:12.21]If you cannot stand beside me
[03:15.62]If there isn't love
[03:16.88]There is only pride
[03:20.75]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up
[03:23.59]After all we have been through
[03:26.95]I can only look at you
[03:30.87]Through the eyes you lied to
[03:33.88]I'm givin' up, givin' up
[03:36.05]I'm givin' up on you
[03:38.77]After all if there is no way out
[03:42.49]If you cannot stand beside me
[03:46.22]If there isn't love
[03:47.72]There is only pride
[03:50.01]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this time
[03:54.35]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
[03:54.52]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
[03:58.52]I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
