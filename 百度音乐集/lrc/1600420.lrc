[00:01.40]The Rose

[00:06.20]
[00:06.88]Some say love it is a river
[00:13.40]That drowns the tender reed
[00:20.52]Some say love it is a razor
[00:28.56]That leaves your soul to bleed
[00:35.02]Some say love it is a hunger
[00:42.63]And endless aching need
[00:50.91]I say love it is a flower
[00:58.71]And you its only seed
[01:09.34]It's the heart afraid of breaking
[01:16.78]That never learns to dance
[01:23.37]It's the dream afraid of waking
[01:31.75]That never takes the chance
[01:38.64]It's the one who won't be taken
[01:46.30]Who can not seem to give
[01:53.81]And the soul afraid of dying
[02:01.39]That never learns to live
[02:09.52]When the night has been too lonely
[02:19.76]And the road has been too long
[02:26.65]And you think that love is only
[02:33.76]For the lucky and the strong
[02:41.21]Just remember in the winter
[02:49.47]Far beneath the bitter snow
[02:56.83]Lies the seed that with the sun's love
[03:04.29]In the spring becomes the rose
