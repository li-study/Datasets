[00:33.61]Title: Papa Don\'t Preach
[00:38.42]Papa I know you\'re going to be upset
[00:42.27]\'Cause I was always your little girl
[00:46.38]But you should know by now
[00:49.14]I\'m not a baby
[00:53.82]You always taught me right from wrong
[00:57.55]I need your help, daddy please be strong
[01:01.96]I may be young at heart
[01:05.04]But I know what I\'m saying
[01:09.45]The one you warned me all about
[01:13.13]The one you said I could do without
[01:17.53]We\'re in an awful mess, and I don\'t mean maybe - please
[01:22.03]Chorus:
[01:25.23]Papa don\'t preach, I\'m in trouble deep
[01:28.39]Papa don\'t preach, I\'ve been losing sleep
[01:33.13]But I made up my mind, I\'m keeping my baby, oh
[01:40.20]I\'m gonna keep my baby, mmm...
[01:43.89]He says that he\'s going to marry me
[01:47.58]We can raise a little family
[01:51.69]Maybe we\'ll be all right
[01:55.62]It\'s a sacrifice
[01:59.42]But my friends keep telling me to give it up
[02:03.12]Saying I\'m too young, I ought to live it up
[02:08.18]What I need right now is some good advice, please
[02:30.55](chorus)
[02:51.03]Daddy, daddy if you could only see
[02:54.61]Just how good he\'s been treating me
[02:58.54]You\'d give us your blessing right now
[03:02.68]\'Cause we are in love, we are in love, so please
[03:16.09](chorus)
[03:26.98]Papa don\'t preach, I\'m in trouble deep
[03:30.35]Papa don\'t preach, I\'ve been losing sleep
[03:43.07](repeat)
[03:45.59]Oh, I\'m gonna keep my baby, ooh
[03:48.92]Don\'t you stop loving me daddy
[03:50.24]I know, I\'m keeping my baby
[04:09.96]
