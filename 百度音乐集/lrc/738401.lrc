[00:01.16]Weezer - Troublemaker
[00:04.61]
[00:05.09]Put me in a special school
[00:06.73]’Cos I am such a fool
[00:08.49]And I don’t need a single book
[00:10.46]To teach me how to read
[00:12.28]Who needs stupid books?
[00:13.99]They are for petty crooks
[00:15.75]And I will learn by studying
[00:17.26]The lesson in my dreams
[00:19.42]Turn off the TV,
[00:21.12]’Cos that’s what others see
[00:22.95]And movies are as bad as
[00:24.74]Eating chocolate ice cream
[00:26.67]They only sicken me
[00:28.45]Don’t let me play football
[00:30.27]I’ll sack the quarterback
[00:34.30]
[00:34.59]I’m a troublemaker
[00:35.57]Never been a faker
[00:38.36]Doing things my own way
[00:40.02]And never giving up.
[00:41.92]I’m a troublemaker
[00:43.75]Not a double taker
[00:45.54]I don’t have the patience
[00:47.24]To keep it on the up.
[00:48.89]
[00:48.90]I picked up a guitar
[00:50.48]What does that signify?
[00:52.36]I’m gonna play some heavy metal riffs
[00:55.19]And you will die
[00:55.98]You wanted arts and crafts
[00:57.77]How’s this for arts and crafts
[00:59.36]Wananana...
[01:02.49]That’s right!
[01:03.09]I’m growing out my hair
[01:04.95]I’m movin’ out to Cherokee
[01:06.71]I’m gonna be a rock star
[01:08.72]And you will go to bed with me
[01:10.52]’Cos I can’t work a job
[01:12.23]Like any other slob.
[01:14.01]Punch it in and punch it out.
[01:16.01]And suckin’ up to ???
[01:17.91]Marrying a bitch.
[01:19.74]Having 7 kids.
[01:21.51]Giving up
[01:22.49]And growing old
[01:23.48]And hoping there’s a God.
[01:24.99]
[01:25.23]I’m a troublemaker
[01:27.01]Never been a faker
[01:28.87]Doing things my own way
[01:30.69]And never giving up.
[01:32.53]I’m a troublemaker
[01:34.35]Not a double taker
[01:36.19]I don’t have the patience
[01:38.03]To keep it on the up.
[01:39.85]
[01:43.77]I’m gonna be a star
[01:45.24]And people will crane necks
[01:47.05]To get a glimpse of me
[01:48.80]And see if I am having a sex.
[01:50.76]In studying and my moves
[01:52.58]They try to understand
[01:54.41]Why I am so unlike the singers
[01:55.88]In the other bands.
[01:58.14]
[01:58.35]I’m such a mystery
[02:00.05]As anyone can see
[02:01.92]There isn’t anybody else
[02:03.63]Exactly quite like me.
[02:05.51]
[02:05.72]And when it's party time
[02:07.55]Like 1999
[02:09.39]I’ll party by myself
[02:11.01]Because I’m such a special guy.
[02:12.98]
[02:13.27]I’m a troublemaker
[02:14.75]Never been a faker
[02:16.93]Doing things my own way
[02:18.72]And never giving up.
[02:20.64]I’m a troublemaker
[02:22.42]Not a double taker
[02:24.28]I don’t have the patience
[02:26.08]To keep it on the up.
[02:28.05](Keep it on the up)
[02:29.96]I’m a troublemaker
[02:31.76](Keep it on the up)
[02:33.54]I’m a troublemaker
[02:39.52][02:35.39](Keep it on the up)
[02:41.20][02:37.19]I’m a troublemaker
[02:43.00]Never giving up.
