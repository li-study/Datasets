[00:10.37]å®‰~~~
[00:31.24]Come tell me your story to unload your glorious grief
[00:39.21]Where you are the valet of honour and i am the thief
[00:46.67]And don\'t ever mention the stains that you left on my track
[00:54.00]How from a beautiful gril I became someone ruined and wrecked
[01:01.29]It was all in your back
[01:05.30]All in your back
[01:09.63]So I spin in the dance of your absence and put on a show
[01:17.74]But why do I smile baby, you of all people should know
[01:24.60]The one that you loved
[01:28.09]Died a long time ago
[01:33.21]You can\'t do me wrong with charity until
[01:41.05]You\'ll exhaust your lies and remedies, you will
[01:48.56]But with your voice and melodies you kill, you kill
[02:04.31]Your version of glory is dark and it\'s covered with sin
[02:11.54]And I wanna dive in an ocean of pink tourmaline
[02:20.11]I\'ve seen the pure souls they exist and they fly
[02:28.02]I think I could live with it, I know I can now
[02:35.06]You can\'t do me wrong with charity until
[02:43.01]You\'ll exhaust your lies and remedies, you will
[02:50.90]But with your voices and melodies you kill, you kill
[03:45.07]It\'s funny how now that I\'m not in the palm of your hand
[03:52.08]You\'re still running blindly to save me again and again
[03:59.29]But i don\'t need a friend
[04:02.93]No, I don\'t need a friend
[04:07.99]You can\'t do me wrong with charity until
[04:15.76]You\'ll exhaust your lies and remedies, you will
[04:23.41]But with your voice and melodies you kill, you kill
