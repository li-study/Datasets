[00:05.96]
[00:33.99]When the rain is blowing in your face,
[00:41.14]and the whole world is on your case,
[00:48.30]I could offer you a warm embrace
[00:55.05]to make you feel my love.
[00:58.75]
[01:02.00]When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
[01:09.34]and there is no one there to dry your tears,
[01:16.37]I could hold you for a million years
[01:22.96]to make you feel my love.
[01:26.88]
[01:29.93]I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
[01:36.69]but I would never do you wrong.
[01:43.29]I've known it from the moment that we met,
[01:49.68]no doubt in my mind where you belong.
[01:53.81]
[01:57.37]I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
[02:04.31]I'd go crawling down the avenue.
[02:11.33]No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
[02:17.96]to make you feel my love.
[02:21.85]
[02:51.93]The storms are raging on the rolling sea
[02:58.54]and on the highway of regret.
[03:05.11]Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,
[03:11.29]you ain't seen nothing like me yet.
[03:16.05]
[03:18.01]I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
[03:25.65]Nothing that I wouldn't do.
[03:32.15]Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
[03:39.20]to make you feel my love
[03:46.46]to make you feel my love
[03:54.22]
