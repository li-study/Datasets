[00:33.78]I've got the power!
[00:42.60]I've got the power!
[00:46.68]Hey, yeah!
[00:51.44]Like the crack of a whip, I snap attack
[00:53.50]Front to back in this thing called "rap."
[00:55.74]Diggin' like a shovel wound double on the heavenly level
[00:58.16]Brighten the bass, turn up the treble
[01:00.30]Radical mind, day and night, all the time

[01:15.14]Some say I'm fresh
[01:16.20]With my voice close to the mesh
[01:17.67]Of the microphone that I am holdin'
[01:19.75]Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
[01:20.57]If they are: Snap!
[01:24.07]Don't need the police
[01:24.89]Don't try to say them, your voice'll sink
[01:27.45]So please, stay off my back
[01:28.99]Or I will attack, and you don't want that!
[01:57.12]I've got the power!
[02:05.86]I've got the power!
[02:14.67]I've got the power!
[02:23.54]I've got the power!
[02:33.00]It's gettin', it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
[02:34.99]It's gettin', it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
[02:37.21]It's gettin', it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
