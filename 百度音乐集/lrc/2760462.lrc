[00:01.36]John Mayer - Assassin
[00:03.93]
[00:11.86]I work in the dead of night
[00:15.48]When the roads are quiet
[00:17.02]No one is around
[00:20.89]To track my moves
[00:22.96]
[00:23.97]Race in the end of lights
[00:26.73]To find the gate is open
[00:29.30]She's waiting in the room
[00:32.42]I just slip on through
[00:34.93]
[00:39.23]You get in You get done
[00:41.89]And then you get gone
[00:45.21]You never leave a trace or show your face
[00:47.99]You get gone
[00:50.76]
[00:51.23]Should have turned around
[00:53.29]And left before the sun came up again
[00:56.74]But the sun came up again
[00:59.65]
[01:18.14]Enter the morning light
[01:20.95]To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
[01:26.66]In a little white room
[01:29.95]No, I'm not alone
[01:32.82]Her head is heavy on me
[01:34.99]She's sleeping like a child
[01:38.66]What could I do?
[01:40.77]
[01:45.23]You get in You get done
[01:48.01]And then you get gone
[01:51.17]You never leave a trace or show your face
[01:53.98]You get gone
[01:56.60]
[01:57.25]Should have turned around
[01:59.86]And left before the sun came up again
[02:02.75]But the sun came up again
[02:05.28]
[02:06.95]I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
[02:12.99]I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
[02:19.08]I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
[02:25.05]Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
[02:32.06]
[02:32.63]Suddenly I'm in over my head and I could hardly breathe
[02:43.89]Suddently I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
[02:55.93]Suddently I know exactly what I did, but I cannot move a thing
[03:07.39]Suddently I know exactly what I'd done
[03:13.69]And what it's gonna mean to me, mean to me
[03:17.92]I'm gone
[03:24.35]
[03:43.04]I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
[03:49.02]I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
[03:55.10]I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
[04:01.15]Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
[04:06.49]
[04:07.03]She's an assassin
[04:12.99]She's an assassin
[04:18.92]She's an assassin
[04:25.00]She's an assassin and she had a job to do
