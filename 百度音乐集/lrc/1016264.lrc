[00:19.01]Insomnia, I welcome thee
[00:34.48]
[00:35.87]能把pop推嚮無底的深淵的力量

[00:39.33]rock'n'roll

[01:03.49]In the nights I see the world bleed
[01:08.03]In my dreams I have to hide
[01:11.66]I cannot close the door to this mystique place
[01:18.27]
[01:19.75]My eyes blinded by the misery
[01:25.28]Never I felt so much fear
[01:30.07]It seems that I'm already in hell
[01:35.65]
[01:38.71]Oh help me, my silent screams remain unheard
[01:53.76]
[01:55.22]Insomnia is the key to my life
[02:02.03]I don't want to see the world behind this thin curtain
[02:13.95]Which separates conscience from sleep
[02:23.89]
[02:24.08]In my back the knife is getting near
[02:30.17]This could be my last breath
[02:33.76]But somewhere I must find the door to morning
[02:39.60]
[02:41.50]This time, if my senses are awake
[02:47.84]I may pass the tin line into safety
[02:54.25]But tomorrow it starts again
[02:59.37]
[03:01.11]Oh help me, my silent screams remain unheard
[03:15.61]
[03:15.70]Insomnia is the key to my life
[03:23.76]I don't want to see the world behind this thin curtain
[03:32.35]Which separates conscience from sleep
[04:25.22]
