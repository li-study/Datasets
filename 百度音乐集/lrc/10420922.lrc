[00:58.99]This is our last goodbye
[01:03.24]I hate to feel the love between us die
[01:09.10]But it's over
[01:11.41]Just hear this and then i'll go
[01:14.91]You gave me more to live for
[01:17.82]More than you'll ever know
[01:23.29]
[01:30.94]This is our last embrace
[01:36.17]Must I dream and always see your face
[01:42.22]Why can't we overcome this wall
[01:47.08]Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all
[01:54.63]
[02:04.51]Kiss me, please kiss me
[02:09.65]But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation
[02:14.13]You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time
[02:21.39]I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye
[02:32.33]
[02:55.74]Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,'
[03:12.31]And did you rush to the phone to call
[03:16.05]Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
[03:21.69]Saying maybe you didn't know him at all
[03:29.83]You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know
[03:37.47]
[03:44.19]Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
[03:48.74]Burning clues into this heart of mine
[03:54.90]Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories
[04:03.40]Offer signs that it's over... it's over
