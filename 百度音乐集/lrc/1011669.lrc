[00:19.02]The moonlight...
[00:22.46]Shines down interstellar beams
[00:27.83]And the groove tonight
[00:31.82]Is something more than you've ever seen
[00:36.43]
[00:38.64]The stars and planets taking shape
[00:42.93]A stolen kiss has come too late
[00:50.65]In the moonlight
[00:53.61]Carry on, keep romancing,
[00:55.83]Carry on, carry on dancing

[01:03.10]Carry on, keep romancing,
[01:06.14]Carry on, carry on dancing
[01:10.38]
[01:10.90]Youre never safe till you see the dawn
[01:15.54]And if the clock strikes past midnight
[01:22.87]The hope is gone
[01:24.13]To move under...
[01:26.55]The moonlight
[01:31.82]Carry on, keep romancing,
[01:35.06]Carry on, carry on dancing
[01:38.17]In the moonlight
[01:41.40]Carry on, keep romancing

[02:00.54]
[02:27.57]Theres a magic only two can tell
[02:33.40]In the dark night
[02:36.32]Ultra violet is a wicked spell
[02:43.13]The stars and planets taking shape
[02:47.58]A stolen kiss has come too late
