[00:04.57]Astrud Gilberto
[00:06.57]
[00:12.57]I;m as restless as a willow in a windstorm
[00:18.11]I;m as jumpy as a puppet on a string
[00:23.85]I;d say that I had spring fever
[00:29.45]But I know it isn;t spring
[00:35.30]I;m as starry eyed and gravely discontented
[00:40.93]Like a nightingale without a song to sing
[00:47.10]Oh why should I have spring fever
[00:52.56]When it isn;t even spring
[00:59.92]I keep wishing I were somewhere else
[01:04.43]Walking down a strange new street
[01:10.59]Hearing words that I have never heard
[01:15.67]From a man I;ve yet to meet
[01:21.14]I;m as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
[01:27.06]I;m as giddy as a baby on a swing
[01:32.95]I haven;t seen a crocus or a rosebud
[01:38.02]Or a robin on the wing
[01:44.24]But I feel so guy in a melancholy way
[01:49.79]That it might as well be spring
[01:57.12]It might as well be spring
[02:03.42]
[02:48.72]I keep wishing I were somewhere else
[02:53.17]Walking down a strange new street
[02:59.46]Hearing words that I have never heard
[03:04.35]From a man I;ve yet to meet
[03:09.85]I;m as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
[03:15.63]I;m as giddy as a baby on a swing
[03:21.94]I haven;t seen a crocus or a rosebud
[03:26.78]Or a robin on the wing
[03:32.85]But I feel so guy in a melancholy way
[03:38.24]That it might as well be spring
[03:45.34]It might as well be spring
[03:51.00]
