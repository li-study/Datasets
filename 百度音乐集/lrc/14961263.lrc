
[00:08.89]Sometimes its hard to be a woman
[00:19.52]Giving all your love to just one man
[00:28.58]You'll have bad times
[00:33.52]And he'll have good times
[00:37.92]Doing things that you don't understand
[00:47.10]But if you love him you'll forgive him
[00:55.97]Even though he's hard to understand
[01:05.05]And if you love him
[01:09.83]Oh be proud of him
[01:14.48]'Cause after all he's just a man
[01:23.77]Stand by your man
[01:28.21]Give him two arms to cling to
[01:32.73]And something warm to come to
[01:37.65]When nights are cold and lonely
[01:41.96]Stand by your man
[01:46.37]And tell the world you love him
[01:50.84]Keep giving all the love you can
[01:59.97]Stand by your man
[02:08.96]Stand by your man
[02:13.20]And show the world you love him
[02:17.96]Keep giving all the love you can
[02:26.82]Stand by your man
