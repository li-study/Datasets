[00:16.84]I would open up the book,
[00:20.44]but i don’t know where to start to look,
[00:24.80]your so tall and your so strong,
[00:28.62]stand by me cause this wont take too long,
[00:34.79]do you remember i called for you but you were gone.
[00:41.41]I thought we were safe but i was wrong,
[00:49.29]i’m just left here standing looking on.
[00:58.49]You ask me which way i’ll go,
[01:01.81]whichever way the wind blows, i don’t know
[01:37.32]And there is no eternity at any price,
[01:41.24]beggers and choosers dont get to live in paradise,
[01:46.21]people die for just one kiss,
[01:54.77]and its plain to me,
[01:57.76]we are not being everything that we could be,
[02:02.31]noone wants to run the risk,
[02:11.07]sometimes i wish i was blind,
[02:14.50]i thought i saw a whole lot more than this
