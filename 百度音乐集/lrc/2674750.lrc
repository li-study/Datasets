[00:25.67]Few drops left of my hope
[00:29.96]I bleed in the name of faith
[00:36.18]Decisions i've made, decisions of fools
[00:42.94]Why am i bleeding for you
[00:48.38]Missing the one who gave me nothing
[00:54.49]The one who dreamed my dreams away
[01:01.06]Why am i bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
[01:07.03]Why am i bleeding for you
[01:14.62]Why am i bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
[01:21.17]Why am i bleeding for you
[01:38.28]Flaming pride in your eyes
[01:43.91]Out of the ashes i'll build mine
[01:49.44]Reason and feelings will never meet in me
[01:56.73]Why am i bleeding for you
[02:02.10]Missing the one who gave me nothing
[02:08.19]The one who dreamed my dreams away
[02:14.65]Why am i bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
[02:20.77]Why am i bleeding for you
[02:26.92]Why am i bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
[02:33.46]Why am i bleeding for you
[02:42.66]I couldn't live life like you could
[02:48.85]I'm still the one misunderstood
[02:55.02]I couldn't be the dream,
[02:57.33]The lonely heart to seal your scheme
[03:01.10]I couldn't live the life you love
