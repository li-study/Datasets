[00:25.00]All those dirty words (Jusqu'a la fin)
[00:31.00]They make us look so dumb (En plein soleil)
[00:37.00]We've been drinking far too much (Jusqu'a la fin)
[00:44.00]And neither of us mean what we say (En plein amour)
[00:49.00]
[00:51.00]Well you and I
[00:56.00]Collapsed in love
[00:59.00]And it looks like we might have made it
[01:04.00]Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
[01:10.00]
[01:22.00]What happened to us? (Jusqu'a la fin)
[01:29.00]Soon it will be gone forever (En plein soleil)

[01:41.00]And neither of us can think straight anymore. (En plein amour)

[02:08.00]When you and I
[02:13.00]Collapsed in love
[02:16.00]Well, it looks like we might have made it
[02:21.00]Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end.

[02:59.00](En plein amour)
[03:04.00]You and I
[03:07.00]We just collapsed in love
