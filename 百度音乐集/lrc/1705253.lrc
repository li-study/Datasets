[00:17.46]The beautiful days are long gone
[00:22.73]I can’t seem to breathe
[00:25.70]It feels like it hasn’t been that long
[00:29.96]Since you walked away from me
[00:33.04]Now I can try to act real strong
[00:37.27]But you and I both know I still think of you that way
[00:44.38]You should know
[00:46.42]…that
[00:47.42]The beautiful lights the star filled nights
[00:52.48]They don’t mean a thing
[00:54.84]Cause you were my star and so it don’t seem right
[00:59.69]Without you here with me
[01:02.62]Now I can try to act real strong
[01:06.97]But you and I both know its hard for me to say
[01:13.64]You were my soul…
[01:16.28]Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
[01:23.56]And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
[01:29.96]And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
[01:37.44]But baby I just wouldn’t be the same
[01:41.40]Cause girl your love is still on my brain
[01:47.78]Now when your in love it takes time to heal
[01:54.17]When someone’s broken your heart and changes how you feel
[02:01.59]Girl I thought that you’d never do me that way
[02:08.80]But even after all I still think of you that way
[02:16.20]Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
[02:23.03]And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
[02:31.22]And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
[02:38.75]But baby I just wouldn’t be the same
[02:42.43]Cause girl your love is still on my brain
[02:47.11]Now love is a game that we both like to play
[02:54.09]But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay
[03:00.95]Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
[03:09.40]Girl you know me inside out and I can’t get you off my mind
[03:16.52]Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
[03:23.88]And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
[03:30.00]And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
[03:38.00]But baby I just wouldn’t the same
[03:41.73]Cause girl your love is still on my brain
