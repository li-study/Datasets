[00:07.30]Out on the wiley, windy moors
[00:10.68]We'd roll and fall in green.
[00:15.07]You had a temper like my jealousy:
[00:19.68]Too hot, too greedy.
[00:22.86]How could you leave me,
[00:24.95]When I needed to possess you?
[00:29.14]I hated you. I loved you, too.
[00:33.44]Bad dreams in the night.
[00:36.13]They told me I was going to lose the fight,
[00:40.71]Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
[00:44.32]Wuthering Heights.
[00:46.01]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[00:49.60]Come home. I'm so cold!
[00:53.18]Let me in-a-your window.
[00:56.79]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[01:01.17]Come home. I'm so cold!
[01:04.36]Let me in-a-your window.
[01:08.45]
[01:11.44]Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,
[01:15.15]On the other side from you.
[01:19.03]I pine a lot. I find the lot
[01:23.41]Falls through without you.
[01:26.73]I'm coming back, love.
[01:29.00]Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,
[01:33.01]My only master.
[01:36.30]Too long I roam in the night.
[01:39.28]I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.
[01:44.68]I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,
[01:48.26]Wuthering Heights,
[01:49.78]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[01:53.25]Come home. I'm so cold!
[01:56.95]Let me in-a-your window.
[02:00.64]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[02:05.13]Come home. I'm so cold!
[02:09.11]Let me in-a-your window.
[02:12.31]
[02:13.30]Ooh! Let me have it.
[02:16.61]Let me grab your soul away.
[02:21.02]Ooh! Let me have it.
[02:24.48]Let me grab your soul away.
[02:28.90]You know it's me--Cathy!
[02:35.26]
[02:38.16]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[02:41.84]Come home. I'm so cold!
[02:45.42]Let me in-a-your window.
[02:49.22]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[02:53.52]Come home. I'm so cold!
[02:57.30]Let me in-a-your window.
[03:01.30]Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
[03:05.38]Come home. I'm so cold!
