[00:07.00]
[00:20.16]I don't care what you think or say
[00:23.89]It doesn't matter what you think it takes
[00:27.21]I'm going to do what I came here to do so you better move
[00:35.01]Cause I'm prepared to lose it all
[00:37.68]I'm not afraid of how far I might fall
[00:40.78]As long as I've done everything i could
[02:23.71][01:28.75][00:47.51]Cause I've waited so long for my time to come
[02:29.84][01:34.98][00:53.91]And I've waited so long to open the door
[01:01.84]And now it's finally opened up
[01:04.63]And all this time I thought it was stuck shut
[01:08.54]Can't wait around to see when it will close
[01:13.23]I don't wanna know
[01:15.48]I know that I've gotta make a move
[01:18.51]I didn't to come this far to not go through
[01:22.52]I know exactly what I have to do
[02:36.57][01:41.38]And I know in the end I may never be here again
[02:43.34][01:48.42]So I'm not going to wait anymore
[01:56.76]No!
[02:58.30][02:55.32][02:13.36][02:08.55]One shot is all I've got
[02:16.66]So I'll hope that my aim is straight and true
[02:50.31]No I'm not going wait anymore
