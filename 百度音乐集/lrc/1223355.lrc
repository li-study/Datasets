[00:22.99]My girl, my girl, don’t lie to me
[00:29.20]Tell me where did you sleep last night
[00:35.49]In the pines, in the pines
[00:38.71]Where the sun don’t ever shine
[00:41.91]I would shiver the whole night through
[00:48.40]My girl, my girl, where will you go
[00:55.09]I’m going where the cold wind blows
[01:02.24]In the pines, in the pines
[01:05.45]Where the sun don’t ever shine
[01:08.86]I would shiver the whole night through
[01:15.48]Her husband, was a hard working man
[01:22.05]Just about a mile from here
[01:28.79]His head was found in a driving wheel
[01:35.39]but his body never was found
[01:42.24]My girl, my girl, don’t lie to me
[01:48.78]Tell me where did you sleep last night
[01:55.39]In the pines, in the pines
[01:58.88]Where the sun don’t ever shine
[02:02.29]I would shiver the whole night through
[02:08.90]
[02:35.48]My girl, my girl, where will you go
[02:42.12]I’m going where the cold wind blows
[02:49.37]In the pines, in the pines
[02:52.37]Where the sun don’t ever shine
[02:55.71]I would shiver the whole night through
[03:02.34]My girl, my girl, don’t lie to me
[03:08.88]Tell me where did you sleep last night
[03:15.53]In the pines, in the pines
[03:18.77]Where the sun don’t ever shine
[03:22.09]I would shiver the whole night through
[03:28.76]My girl, my girl, where will you go
[03:35.35]I’m going where the cold wind blows
[03:42.11]In the pines,pines,sun,sun
[03:48.85]I would shiver the whole night through
[04:06.49]
