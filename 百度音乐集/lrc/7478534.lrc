[00:03.88]Rihanna 、Eminem
[00:05.28]
[00:00.18]On the first page of our story
[00:06.33]the future seemed so bright
[00:11.95]then this thing turned out so evil
[00:17.34]I don’t know why I’m still surprised
[00:23.61]even angels have their wicked schemes
[00:29.71]and you take that to new extremes
[00:35.48]but you’ll always be my hero
[00:40.46]even though you’ve lost your mind
[00:44.90]
[00:46.31]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[00:51.38]but that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
[00:57.46]just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[01:03.08]but that’s all right because I love the way you lie
[01:08.89]I love the way you lie
[01:12.75]Ohhh, I love the way you lie
[01:17.00]
[01:21.48]Now there’s gravel in our voices
[01:26.68]glass is shattered from the fight
[01:32.88]in this tug of war, you’ll always win
[01:38.87]even when I’m right
[01:44.57]‘cause you feed me fables from your hand
[01:50.63]with violent words and empty threats
[01:56.32]and it’s sick that all these battles
[02:01.05]are what keeps me satisfied
[02:06.39]
[02:07.26]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[02:12.50]but that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
[02:18.54]just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[02:24.27]but that’s all right because I love the way you lie
[02:29.78]I love the way you lie
[02:33.67]Ohhh, I love the way you lie
[02:42.64]So maybe I’m a masochist
[02:48.57]I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
[02:54.54]till the walls are goin’ up
[03:00.06]in smoke with all our memories
[03:06.05]
[03:06.24]This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
[03:08.59]smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
[03:10.93]hush baby, speak softly, tell me you’ll be sorry
[03:14.09]that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
[03:16.67]so I can push you off me
[03:18.08]try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
[03:20.89]run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
[03:23.66]baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me  Baby，
[03:26.49]then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
[03:29.63]then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
[03:32.54]destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
[03:35.29]know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
[03:38.56]that we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
[03:41.16]together, we move mountains,
[03:42.26]let’s not make mountains out of molehills,
[03:44.65]you hit me twice, yeah, but who’s countin’
[03:46.97]I may have hit you three times, I’m startin’ to lose count
[03:50.04]but together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
[03:51.78]our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counsellin’
[03:55.20]this house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
[03:58.47]square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
[04:01.27]with you I’m in my fuckin’ mind, without you, I’m out it
[04:02.98]
[04:03.21]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[04:08.00]but that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
[04:14.23]just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[04:19.73]but that’s all right because I love the way you lie
[04:25.49]I love the way you lie
[04:31.53]I love the way you lie
[04:37.21]I love the way you lie
[04:39.19]
[04:48.84]I love the way you lie
[04:51.38]
