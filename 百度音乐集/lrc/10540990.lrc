[00:15.86]I could go back to every laugh,
[00:23.13]But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
[00:27.56]And I know all the steps up to your door,
[00:36.44]But I don't wanna' go there anymore.
[00:40.25]
[00:40.70]Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
[00:43.97]Talk to the man with the reasons why,
[00:48.35]And let me know what you find.
[00:52.94]
[00:54.97]I’ll leave my window open,
[01:01.09]‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name.
[01:08.04]Just know I’m right here hopin’,
[01:14.65]That you’ll come in with the rain.
[01:19.79]
[01:25.73]I could stand up and sing you a song,
[01:33.72]But I don’t wanna’ have to go that far.
[01:37.09]And I, I’ve got you down,
[01:42.11]I know you by heart,
[01:47.15]And you don’t even know where I start.
[01:50.54]
[01:50.89]Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
[01:53.95]Talk to the man who put you here,
[01:58.49]And don’t wait for the sky to clear.
[02:02.42]
[02:04.89]I’ll leave my window open,
[02:11.32]‘Cus I’m too tired at night to call your name.
[02:16.48]Oh, just know I’m right here hopin’,
[02:24.60]That you’ll come in with the rain.
[02:29.70]
[02:48.02]I’ve watched you so long,
[02:52.25]Screamed your name,
[02:54.96]I don’t know what else I can say.
[03:03.40]
[03:08.01]But I’ll leave my window open,
[03:14.60]‘Cus I’m too tired at night for all these games.
[03:21.37]Just know I’m right here hopin’,
[03:27.98]That you’ll come in with the rain.
[03:32.23]
[03:39.06]I could go back to every laugh,
