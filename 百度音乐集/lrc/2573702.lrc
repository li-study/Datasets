[00:01.96]I blame you for the moonlit sky
[00:04.87]and the dream that died with the eagle's flight
[00:11.04]I blame you for the moonlit nights
[00:14.96]when I wonder why are the seas still dry?
[00:21.00]Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[00:25.44]
[00:27.50]Did we fly to the moon too soon?
[00:29.70]Did we squander the chance?
[00:31.70]In the rush of the race
[00:33.11]the reason we chase is lost in romance
[00:38.42]and still we try to justify the waste
[00:43.54]for a taste of mans greatest adventure.

[01:02.08]when I wonder why are the seas still dry?
[01:08.45]Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[01:12.48]
[01:14.97]Have we lost what it takes to advance?
[01:17.16]Have we peaked too soon?
[01:19.21]If the world is so green then
[01:21.12]why does it scream under a blue moon?
[01:25.66]We wonder why
[01:29.89]If the earth's sacrificed
[01:31.09]for the price of its greatest treasure
[01:34.95]
[01:36.16]I blame you for the moonlit sky

[01:55.88]Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[02:00.72]
[02:23.07]And when we shoot for the stars
[02:24.90]what a giant step have we got
[02:27.37]what it takes to carry the weight of this concept?
[02:33.33]Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
[02:38.35]miss the mark with a sense of adventure
[02:42.44]
[02:43.82]I blame you for the moonlit sky
