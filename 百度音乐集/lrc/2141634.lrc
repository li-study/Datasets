[00:06.00]我们相爱一年了，OH，YEAH
[00:20.95]Stitch in your knitted brow
[00:29.34]And you don\'t know how
[00:33.84]You\'re gonna get it out
[00:40.70]Crushed under heavy chest
[00:49.15]Trying to catch your breath
[00:54.03]But it always beats you by a step, all right now
[01:01.76]
[01:04.91]Making the best of it
[01:10.08]Playing the hand you get
[01:14.79]You\'re not alone in this
[01:19.33]
[01:20.62]There\'s hope for the hopeless
[01:30.57]There\'s hope for the hopeless
[01:40.40]There\'s hope
[01:45.50]
[01:46.24]Cold in a summer breeze
[01:54.06]Yeah, you\'re shivering
[01:59.15]On your bended knee
[02:06.09]Still, when you\'re heart is sore
[02:14.46]And the heavens pour
[02:19.39]Like a willow bending with the storm, you\'ll make it
[02:25.73]
[02:29.74]Running against the wind
[02:34.67]Playing the cards you get
[02:39.86]Something is bound to give
[02:42.89]
[02:45.65]There\'s hope for the hopeless
[02:55.66]There\'s hope for the hopeless
[03:05.87]There\'s hope
[03:15.81]There\'s hope
[03:25.81]There\'s hope
[03:30.80]很爱很爱你
[03:55.78]There\'s hope
