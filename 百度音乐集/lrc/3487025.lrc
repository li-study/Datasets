
[00:15.00]I've been searching for you
[00:21.00]I heard a cry within my soul
[00:25.00]I've never had a yearning quite like this before
[00:31.00]Know that you are walking right through my door
[00:39.00]All of my life
[00:42.00]Where have you been
[00:45.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[00:51.00]And if that day comes
[00:54.00]I know we could win
[00:57.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[01:03.00]A sacred gift of heaven
[01:09.00]For better worse, wherever
[01:14.00]And I would never let somebody break you down
[01:19.00]Until you cried, never
[01:27.00]All of my life
[01:30.00]Where have you been
[01:33.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[01:39.00]And if that day comes
[01:42.00]I know we could win
[01:45.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[01:50.00]At every time I've always known
[01:53.00]That you where there, upon your throne
[01:56.00]A lonely queen without her king
[01:59.00]I longed for you, my love forever
[02:28.00]All of my life
[02:31.00]Where have you been
[02:34.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[02:39.00]And if that day comes
[02:42.00]I know we could win
[02:46.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[02:52.00]All of my life
[02:55.00]Where have you been
[02:57.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:04.00]And if that day comes
[03:07.00]I know we could win
[03:10.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:16.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:22.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:28.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:34.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again
[03:40.00]I wonder if I'll ever see you again.......(and fade)
