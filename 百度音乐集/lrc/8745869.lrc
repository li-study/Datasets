[03:40][03:02][00:04]Girls you know you betta watch out

[03:49][03:11][00:09]That thing, that thing, that thing
[03:16][00:13]That thing, that thing, that thing
[00:19](admit two shots in the atmosphere)
[00:25]
[00:28]It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
[00:31]The one you let hit it and never called you again
[00:33]'Member when he told you he was 'bout the benjamins
[00:36]You act like you ain't here him then gave him a little trim
[00:38]To begin how you think you really gon' pretend
[00:40]Like you wasn't down and you called him again
[00:42]Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
[00:46]If you did then you'd probably fuck him again
[00:48]Talkin' out cha neck saying your a Christian
[00:51]A Muslim sleepin' wit da gin
[00:52]Now that was the sin that did Jezebell in
[00:55]Who you gon' tell when the reprecussion spin
[00:57]Showin' off your ass cause your thinkin' it's a trend
[00:59]Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
[01:02]You know I only say it cause i'm truely genuine
[01:04]Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
[01:07]Baby girl the respect is just the minimum
[01:09]Niggas fucked up and you still defendin' him
[01:12]Now Lauryn is only human
[01:14]Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
[01:16]Let it sit inside your head like a million women, in Philly, Penn.
[01:19]It's silly when girls sell their souls cause it's in
[01:22]Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
[01:24]Fake nails done by Koreans, come again
[01:26]
[02:35][01:28](Yeah, Yeah) come again
[02:37][01:30](Yeah, Yeah) come again
[01:32]My friend come again
[03:20]
[03:22][01:36]Guys you know you betta watch out
[03:26][01:40]Some girls, some girls are only about
[03:30][01:44]That thing, that thing, that thing
[03:35][01:49]That thing, that thing, that thing
[01:55]The second verse it dedicated to the men
[01:57]More concerned concerned wit his rims & his Timbs than his women
[02:00]Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
[02:02]Don't care who they offend, popping yang (like you got yen) .........
[02:05]Let's not pretend, the women pack the pistol by they waist men
[02:07]Pissed out by they case men, still in they mother's basement
[02:09]The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
[02:12]Need to take care of their three and four kids men
[02:14]But they facing court case when the child support place
[02:16]Money takin' and heart breakin,
[02:18]Now you wonderin' why women hate men
[02:19]The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
[02:21]The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
[02:23]How you gon' win when you ain't right within
[02:26]How you gon' win when you ain't right within
[02:28]How you gon' win when you ain't right within
[02:31]Uh Uh Come Again!
[02:57][02:53][02:48][02:43]Watch out, watch out
[02:59][02:55][02:50][02:45]Watch out, watch out
[03:52]
[03:53]The End.
