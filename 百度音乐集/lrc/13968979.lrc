[00:14.39]I know what I said
[00:19.37]Was heat of the moment
[00:26.05]But there‘s a little truth in between the words we\'ve spoken
[00:32.20]Its a little late now to fix the heart that’s broken
[00:38.10]Please don\'t ask me where I\'m going
[00:43.81]Cuz I don\'t know
[00:48.64]No I don\'t know anymore
[00:59.75]It used to feel like heaven
[01:06.07]Used to feel like may
[01:10.61]I used to hear those violins playing our strings like a symphony
[01:19.06]Now they\'ve gone away
[01:24.45]Nobody wants to face the truth
[01:30.04]But you wont believe what love can do
[01:35.94]Till it happens to you
[01:42.42]Till it happens to you
[01:50.56]Went to the old flat
[01:55.52]Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
[02:00.50]How come that nothing feels the same now when I\'m with you
[02:06.75]We used to stay up all night in the kitchen
[02:10.46]When our love was new
[02:12.74]Oooh love I\'m a fool to believe in you
[02:18.67]Cuz I don\'t know
[02:24.68]No I don\'t know
[02:30.73]Anymore
[02:36.20]It used to feel like heaven
[02:41.59]It used to feel like may
[02:48.14]I used to hear those violins playing our strings like a symphony
[02:55.11]Now they\'ve gone away
[03:00.35]Nobody wants to know the truth
[03:06.42]Until their hearts broken
[03:11.67]Don\'t you dare tell them
[03:14.48]What you think to do
[03:17.92]Till they get over
[03:23.10]You can only learn these things
[03:27.39]From experience
[03:30.10]When you get older
[03:32.51]I just wish that someone would have told me
[04:06.93]Till it happens to you
