[00:00.00]Elaine Paige - Memory
[00:03.59]
[00:05.59]Midnight
[00:08.35]Not a sound from the pavement
[00:12.84]Has the moon lost her memory?
[00:17.68]She is smiling alone
[00:22.49]In the lamplight
[00:26.19]The withered leaves collect at my feet
[00:31.38]And the wind begins to moan
[00:38.96]
[00:39.75]Memory
[00:42.31]All alone in the moonlight
[00:46.76]I can smile at the old days
[00:51.41]Life was beautiful then
[00:56.67]I remember
[00:59.77]The time I knew what happiness was
[01:05.21]Let the memory live again
[01:12.29]
[01:13.41]Every street lamp
[01:16.85]Seems to beat
[01:20.19]A fatalistic warning
[01:27.72]Someone mutters
[01:30.84]And a street lamp gutters
[01:34.64]And soon it will be morning
[01:42.76]
[01:43.56]Daylight
[01:46.12]I must wait for the sunrise
[01:50.10]I must think of a new life
[01:54.25]And I mustn't give in
[01:59.30]When the dawn comes
[02:01.94]Tonight will be a memory too
[02:07.11]And a new day will begin
[02:14.58]
[02:45.63]Burnt out ends of smoky days
[02:52.44]The stale cold smell of morning
[02:59.59]The street lamp dies
[03:02.52]Another night is over
[03:06.85]Another day is dawning
[03:14.85]
[03:15.64]Touch me
[03:18.42]It's so easy to leave me
[03:22.82]All alone with my memory
[03:27.57]Of my days in the sun
[03:34.04]If you touch me
[03:37.55]You'll understand what happiness is
[03:43.88]Look a new day has begun ...
[03:55.01]
[04:13.78]~END~
