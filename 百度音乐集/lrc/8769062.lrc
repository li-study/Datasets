[00:09.75]You got a lot of money, but you can't afford the freeway
[00:19.32]The road to Orange County leaves an awful lot of leeway
[00:29.08]Where everyone's a doctor or a specialist in retail
[00:38.75]They'll sell you all the speed you want if you can take the blackmail
[00:46.06]
[00:49.57]You know it
[00:52.04]I know it
[00:54.49]Why don't you

[01:28.09]The sacrifice is worth it just to hang around the arcade

[02:15.98]You got a lot of money, but you can't afford the freeway
[02:23.17]
[02:27.23]And everything I do is wrong
[02:31.89]But at least I'm hanging on
[02:34.76]
[02:35.54]You got a lot of money, but you can't afford
[02:40.37]You got a lot of money, but you can't afford
