[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:23.14]Lurking, waiting
[00:25.87]Seeking for your smell
[00:28.40]Feelings rising
[00:31.41]I fell under your spell
[00:33.60]
[00:34.39]Dreaming of a life with you
[00:37.10]And you don't give a damn
[00:39.11]
[00:40.28]'Cause when I die I go to heaven
[00:45.90]And if it's hell I'll take that too
[00:51.07]Someday, I know, we'll be together
[00:56.88]Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust
[01:00.06]
[01:02.00]Won't you taste me
[01:04.83]I know what you need
[01:07.79]Can't you trust me
[01:10.48]I would just exceed
[01:12.59]
[01:13.50]Don't you feel just like I do
[01:16.20]Who cares, it's all the same
[01:18.14]
[01:19.38]'Cause when I die I go to heaven
[01:24.76]And if it's hell I'll take that too
[01:30.16]Someday, I know, we'll be together
[01:35.55]Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust
[01:39.39]
[02:55.43]'Cause when I die I go to heaven
[03:01.18]And if it's hell I'll take that too
[03:06.38]Someday, I know, we'll be together
[03:12.05]Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust
[03:16.29]Dust to Dust
[03:17.96]Cause when I die I go to heaven
[03:23.26]And if it's hell I'll take that too
[03:28.69]Someday, I know, we'll be together
[03:34.42]Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust
