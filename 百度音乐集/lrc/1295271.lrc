[00:09.37]Saw you from the distance
[00:13.81]Saw you from the stage
[00:18.24]Something about the look in your eyes
[00:22.07]Something about your beautiful face
[00:27.03]In a sea of people
[00:31.43]There was only you
[00:35.82]I never knew what the song was about
[00:39.47]But suddenly now I do
[00:43.76]Tryin' to reach out to you, touch my hands
[00:48.85]Reach out as far as you can
[00:52.50]Only me, only you, and the band
[00:56.79]Tryin' to reach out to you touch my hands
[01:00.29]Can't let the music stop
[01:04.18]Can't let this feeling end
[01:08.57]Cause if I do it'll all be over
[01:13.20]And I'll never see you again
[01:17.59]Can't let the music stop
[01:21.87]Until I touch your hand
[01:26.23]Cause if I do it'll all be over
[01:30.55]And I'll never get the chance again
[01:34.60]I'll never get the chance again
[01:38.89]I'll never get the chance again
[01:45.42]I see the sparkle of a million flashlights
[01:50.39]A wonderwall of stars
[01:55.56]But the one that's shining out so bright is the one right where you are
[02:03.47]Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand
[02:08.22]Reach out as far as you can
[02:12.08]Only me, only you, and the band
[02:16.47]Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand
[02:19.81]Can't let the music stop
[02:23.86]Can't let this feeling end
[02:28.26]Cause if I do it'll all be over,
[02:32.34]I'll never see you again
[02:37.06]Can't let the music stop
[02:41.51]Until I touch your hand
[02:45.85]Cause if I do it'll all be over,
[02:50.06]I'll never get the chance again
[02:54.30]I'll never get the chance again
