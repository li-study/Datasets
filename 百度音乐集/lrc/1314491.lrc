[00:01.41][00:03.48][03:39.96][03:55.35]
[00:04.04][02:10.61]Should I say yes or no
[00:05.61][02:12.09]Should I just let it go
[00:07.33][02:13.74]Should I slow down my roll
[00:09.06][02:15.57]Let me think 'cuz I really don't know
[00:12.07][02:18.47]Don't know what to do about it baby
[00:17.91]Is tonight's the night that you take
[00:19.20]Control of me
[00:20.06]Tell me boy, what's it really gonna be
[00:21.30]spending time for a while
[00:22.59]Oh daddy come close, I'm straight
[00:23.90]I'm feeling your style
[00:25.20]I love the way you make me feel
[00:25.91]When you keep it real
[00:26.69]When you're holding me
[00:27.50]When you're spooning me
[00:28.39]Oh you look sexy when you're
[00:29.60]Touching Me
[00:30.32]When you're bumping me gently
[00:31.96]Sitting here waiting in my Vicky's
[00:33.75]In the mirror imaging you're with me
[00:35.47]Petit Cheri and I'm smelling real nice
[00:37.19]And Jouet could chillin' on ice
[00:38.97]Coming over at a half past ten
[00:40.43]And I'm wondering if I'm really gonna
[00:41.92]Let him in
[00:42.75]Give in
[00:43.19]Give it up
[00:43.65]Let it go
[00:44.23]Or tell him no
[00:45.39][01:27.76][01:41.06][02:37.85][02:51.33][03:05.85][03:19.44]Should I just give him some
[00:49.26][00:56.22][01:31.42][01:38.55][01:45.46][01:52.50][01:56.18][02:41.70][02:48.71][02:55.61][03:02.67][03:09.75][03:16.79][03:23.87][03:30.86]Maybe
[00:51.87][01:34.09][01:48.13][02:44.33][02:58.39][03:12.48][03:26.52]Is this the night for fun
[01:00.03]So, here it is, and he comes right in
[01:01.24]And I fix us drinks
[01:02.21]And I start to think
[01:03.03]About what I'm gonna do
[01:03.90]Will a brother be true
[01:05.00]Will he size my body up and down
[01:07.10]Can he beat the odds
[01:08.25]Can he play it safe
[01:08.87]Will he make me hot
[01:09.75]Will he hit the spot
[01:10.59]That I love a lot
[01:11.52]Will he leave me hanging lonely
[01:13.25]Desperately
[01:14.14]Will he go and tell all his friends
[01:15.85]That we did it and we did it again
[01:17.45]Had me weak between the sheets
[01:19.32]Will he say I was a real big freak
[01:21.12]Maybe I should slow it down
[01:22.49]Cool off my flow, relax
[01:24.19]And let him know if this gets out
[01:25.69]No more, no glove, no love, oh no
[01:59.35][03:37.88]Pretty baby
[02:03.15]Love me like a lady
[02:24.47]If I do it will I regret it?
[02:26.02]Maybe I should just forget it
[02:27.78]What about if he ain't got no dough?
[02:29.59]Tell me I should let him go
[03:40.42]<END>
