[00:24.49]Danny is lonely
[00:27.24]Mary's in India now
[00:35.29]She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
[00:42.07]
[00:46.29]She left all her things well,
[00:49.38]her books and her letters from him
[00:55.82]But as the sun rises on Mary sets on him
[01:03.71]
[01:07.41]And just dance, and just drink
[01:12.83]And just see the things
[01:15.68]I probably never get the chance to see
[01:20.34]
[01:24.76]Danny's not eating,
[01:27.56]he's drinking and sleeping
[01:35.71]I saw him last night at party,
[01:39.21]he's definitely thin
[01:42.02]
[01:46.75]He says he's happy, look pretty good
[01:51.38]But I think
[01:56.37]That as the sun rises on Mary sets on him
[02:04.31]
[02:07.84]And just dance, and just drink
[02:13.38]And just see the things
[02:16.15]I probably never get the chance to see
[02:20.82]
[02:25.23]Danny came over last night and I cooked for him
[02:36.14]He talked about you Mary
[02:38.95]and how much we loved you still
[02:42.67]
[02:47.11]He told me he's packed up your books
[02:50.45]and your letters and things
[02:56.81]But as the sun sets on Mary, it's rising on him
[03:04.61]
[03:08.30]And we danced, and we drank
[03:13.70]And I've seen something
[03:16.43]you probably never got the chance to see
[03:21.46]
[03:24.74]Don't worry, Mary
[03:27.75]Cause I'm taking care of Danny
[03:34.64]And he's taking care of me
[03:38.01]
