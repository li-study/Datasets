[00:09.65]All of these lines across my face
[00:14.75]Tell you the story of who I am
[00:19.78]So many stories of where I\'ve been
[00:25.27]And how I got to where I am
[00:30.44]But these stories don\'t mean anything
[00:36.31]When you\'ve got no one to tell them to
[00:41.05]It\'s true...
[00:44.28]I was made for you
[00:48.44]
[00:50.88]I climbed across the mountain tops
[00:55.78]Swam all across the ocean blue
[01:00.79]I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
[01:05.84]But baby I broke them all for you
[01:10.98]Because even when I was flat broke
[01:17.30]You made me feel like a million bucks
[01:22.03]Yeah you do and I was made for you
[01:29.88]
[02:12.83]You see the smile that\'s on my mouth
[02:17.46]Is hiding the words that don\'t come out
[02:22.76]And all of my friends who think that I\'m blessed
[02:27.94]They don\'t know my head is a mess
[02:33.58]No, they don\'t know who I really am
[02:39.35]And they don\'t know what I\'ve been through but you do
[02:47.20]And I was made for you...
[02:53.84]All of these lines across my face
[02:58.91]Tell you the story of who I am
[03:03.98]So many stories of where I\'ve been
[03:08.99]And how I got to where I am
[03:13.97]But these stories don\'t mean anything
[03:20.13]When you\'ve got no one to tell them to
[03:25.41]It\'s true...
[03:28.63]I was made for you
[03:34.07]It\'s true...
[03:38.30]I was made for you
