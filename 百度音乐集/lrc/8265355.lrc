[00:57.00]Baby, do you understand me now
[01:00.60]Sometimes I feel a little mad
[01:05.00]But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
[01:09.00]When things go wrong and thing to be bad
[01:13.00]cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
[01:17.01]Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
[01:21.00]
[01:28.11]If I seem edgy
[01:30.00]I want you to know
[01:32.40]That I never meant to take it out on you
[01:36.90]Life has its problems and I got my share
[01:40.95]that's one thing I never meant to do cause i love you
[01:45.80]Oh,baby - don't you know I'm just human
[01:49.70]and I have got thoughts like any other man
[01:53.20]Sometimes I feel myself, Lord, regretting
[01:57.80]Some foolish thing - some foolish thing I've done
[02:01.10]cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
[02:05.45]Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
[02:10.00]
[02:17.50]Oh Lord,don't let me be misunderstood
[02:24.00]don't let me be,don't let me be misunderstood
