[00:02.01]Run
[00:05.13]Snow Patrol
[00:10.14]
[00:26.04]I'll sing it one last time for you
[00:32.14]Then we really have to go
[00:37.92]You've been the only thing that's right
[00:44.29]In all I've done
[00:50.09]
[00:51.51]And I can barely look at you
[00:57.04]But every single time I do
[01:03.11]I know we'll make it anywhere
[01:10.19]Anyway from here
[01:12.28]
[01:17.82]Light up, light up
[01:22.17]As if you have a choice
[01:27.26]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[01:33.79]I'll be right beside you dear
[01:39.78]
[01:44.22]Louder louder
[01:47.80]And we'll run for our lives
[01:53.10]I can hardly speak I understand
[01:59.07]Why you can't raise your voice to say
[02:03.57]
[02:21.13]To think I might not see those eyes
[02:27.84]Makes it so hard not to cry
[02:34.04]And as we say our long goodbye
[02:40.29]I nearly do
[02:42.83]
[02:48.60]Light up, light up
[02:53.23]As if you have a choice
[02:57.37]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[03:03.82]I'll be right beside you dear
[03:09.42]
[03:14.40]Louder louder
[03:18.25]And we'll run for our lives
[03:23.16]I can hardly speak I understand
[03:29.48]Why you can't raise your voice to say
[03:34.52]
[03:40.35]Slower,slower
[03:44.52]We don't have time for that
[03:48.91]All i want is find an easier way
[03:55.03]To get out of our little head
[04:01.03]
[04:05.98]Have heart my dear
[04:09.72]We're bound to be afraid
[04:14.60]Even if it's just for a few days
[04:21.08]Making up for all this mess
[04:26.84]
[05:23.10]Light up, light up
[05:26.71]As if you have a choice
[05:31.90]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[05:38.38]I'll be right beside you dear
[05:42.30]
