[00:24.11]I realized as I lay down to sleep
[00:28.56]We haven't spoke in weeks
[00:33.67]So many things that I'd like to know
[00:38.29]Come have a talk with me
[00:43.85]I need a sign, something I can see
[00:48.93]Why all the mystery?
[00:54.03]I try not to fall for make believe
[00:58.85]But what is reality?
[01:04.09]Where do we go?
[01:05.70]What do we know?
[01:11.06]Life has to have a meaning
[01:14.30]Show me the light
[01:16.52]Show me the way
[01:19.41]Show that you're listening
[01:23.51]
[01:24.39]Show me that you love me
[01:26.90]Show me that you walk with me
[01:34.01]Hopefully, just above me
[01:36.99]Heaven's watching over me
[01:45.27]Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you
[01:50.19]For all you've given me
[01:55.22]Sometimes the price of what you gave to me
[02:00.34]I can't stop questioning
[02:05.84]O God of love, peace, and mercy
[02:10.33]Why so much suffering?
[02:15.68]I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
[02:20.42]Wonder if you're listening
[02:25.50]When people go
[02:27.61]Why do they go?
[02:30.59]Why don't you choose me?
[02:35.48]But someday I know
[02:37.69]I'm gonna go
[02:41.11]I hope you're waiting for me
[02:46.47]Show me that you love me
[02:51.01]Show me that you walk with me
[02:56.49]Hopefully, just above me
[03:02.60]Heaven's watching over me
[03:47.26]Maybe we'll talk
[03:50.71]Some other night
[03:53.32]Right now I'll take it easy
[03:57.45]Won't spent my time
[03:59.45]Waiting to die
[04:03.18]Enjoy the life I'm living
[04:10.26]Show me that you love me
[04:16.38]Show me that you walk with me
[04:20.61]Hopefully, just above me
[04:25.49]Heaven's watching over me
[04:34.90]Show me that you love me
[04:38.63]Show me that you walk with me
[04:41.36]Hopefully, just above me
[04:45.95]Heaven's watching over me
