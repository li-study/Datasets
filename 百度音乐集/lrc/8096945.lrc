[00:34.01]Everywhere you go
[00:38.09]Everywhere you see
[00:42.48]There's nothing much to say now
[00:46.08]And days go by between
[00:50.77]And if I had a sign
[00:55.14]I wouldn't feel the need
[00:59.52]Cause if I held you now
[01:03.78]I might as well hold a dream
[01:08.32]Everywhere you go
[01:12.42]Everywhere you see
[01:16.62]There's nothing much to say now
[01:20.39]And days go by between
[01:25.14]If I had a sign
[01:29.80]I wouldn't feel the need
[01:33.73]If I held you now
[01:38.12]I might as well be holding a dream
[01:59.84]Everywhere you go
[02:03.80]Everywhere I'll be
[02:08.02]There mightn't be much left to say
[02:11.90]But says go by, and I'll not forget
[02:16.91]We've got all this time
[02:21.16]And I've got all I need
[02:25.20]Will you hold me now
[02:29.12]Cause you're all that matters to me
