[00:01.13]Body and soul
[00:07.04]dorothyjazz upload
[00:24.12]My heart is sad and lonely
[00:35.96]For you I sigh, for you dear only
[00:46.38]Why haven't you seen it?
[00:56.12]I'm all for you body and soul
[01:08.37]I spend my days in longing
[01:18.48]And wondering why
[01:22.45]It's me you're wronging
[01:29.69]I tell you I mean it
[01:36.58]I'm all for you body and soul
[01:48.28]I can't believe it
[01:53.39]It's hard to conceive it
[01:55.92]That you'd turn away romance
[02:08.85]Are you pretending?
[02:12.89]It looks like the ending
[02:19.34]Unless I could have one more chance to prove
[02:27.31]Dear, my life's a wreck you're making
[02:39.67]You know that I'm yours for just the taking
[02:50.98]I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

[03:50.99]I can't believe it
[03:57.43]It's hard to conceive it
[04:02.59]That you'd turn away romance
[04:12.63]Are you pretending?
[04:19.87]It looks like the ending
[04:22.82]Unless I could have one more chance to prove
[04:30.35]Dear, my life's a wreck you're making
[04:44.44]You know that I'm yours for just the taking
[04:54.49]I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
