[00:08.63]Wake up everyone
[00:11.72]How can you sleep at a time like this
[00:14.61]Unless the dreamer is the real you
[00:18.18]Listen to your voice
[00:21.00]The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
[00:25.43]Lip and the neck will appear
[00:28.13]
[00:28.60]I don't wanna wake before
[00:32.15]The dream is over
[00:35.33]I'm gonna make it mine
[00:38.46]Yes i... i know it
[00:41.68]I'm gonna make it mine
[00:44.84]Yes i'll make it all mine
[00:48.77]
[00:53.15]I keep my life on a heavy rotation
[00:56.50]Requesting that it's lifting you up
[00:58.90]Up up and away
[01:00.48]And over to a table at the graditude cafe
[01:04.77]
[01:06.13]And i am finally there
[01:08.87]And all the angels they'll be singing
[01:10.81]Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you
[01:17.46]
[01:18.02]I don't wanna break before
[01:21.80]The tour is over
[01:24.91]I'm gonna make it mine
[01:28.25]Yes i...i know it
[01:31.19]I'm gonna make it mine
[01:34.18]Yes i'll make it all mine
[01:37.61]
[02:03.70]And timing's everything
[02:06.57]and this time there's plenty
[02:10.10]I am balancing
[02:13.27]Careful and steady
[02:15.24]And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting
[02:19.86]
[02:20.25]Well I don't wanna wait no more
[02:24.05]No i wanna celebrate the whole world
[02:27.25]I'm gonna make it mine
[02:30.38]Because i'm following your joy
[02:33.74]I'm gonna make it mine
[02:36.86]Because i... i am open
[02:39.92]I'm gonna make it mine
[02:43.30]Yes i... i'm gonna show it
[02:46.19]Yes i'm gonna make it all mine
