[00:05.89]
[00:11.23]The question was raised
[00:13.04]As my conscience fell
[00:15.70]A silly, little lie
[00:20.91]It didn’t mean much
[00:23.32]But it lingers still
[00:25.71]In the corners of my mind
[00:29.70]
[00:30.57]Still you call me to walk
[00:33.40]On the edge of this world
[00:36.10]To spread my dreams and fly
[00:41.07]But the future’s so far
[00:43.60]My heart is so frail
[00:45.99]I think I’d rather stay inside
[00:50.23]
[00:50.83]But You love me anyway
[00:56.19]It’s like nothing in life that I’ve ever known
[01:01.20]You love me anyway
[01:06.34]Oh Lord, how You love me
[01:11.21]How You love me
[01:15.72]
[01:16.70]It took more than my strength
[01:19.52]To simply be still
[01:22.02]To seek but never find
[01:26.85]All the reasons we change
[01:29.72]The reasons I doubt
[01:31.88]And why do loved ones have to die?
[01:36.59]
[01:36.86]But You love me anyway
[01:42.12]It’s like nothing in life that I’ve ever known
[01:46.73]You love me anyway
[01:51.96]Oh Lord, how You love me
[01:58.19]I am the thorn in Your crown
[02:02.44]But You love me anyway
[02:07.95]I am the sweat from Your brow
[02:12.91]But You love me anyway
[02:18.35]I am the nail in Your wrist
[02:22.98]But You love me anyway
[02:28.02]I am Judas’ kiss
[02:33.37]But You love me anyway
[02:37.50]
[02:37.92]See now, I am the man that called out from the crowd
[02:43.23]For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking ground
[02:47.74]Yes then, I turned away with this smile on my face
[02:53.34]With this sin in my heart tried to bury Your grace
[02:58.69]And then alone in the night, I still called out for You
[03:03.44]So ashamed of my life, my life, my life
[03:10.02]
[03:12.81]But You love me anyway
[03:17.66]Oh, God… how you love me
[03:22.76]You love me anyway
[03:28.06]It’s like nothing in life that I’ve ever known
[03:32.95]You love me anyway
[03:38.11]Oh Lord, how You love me
[03:43.58]You love me, You love me
[03:53.41]You love me, You love me
[04:03.22]How You love me
[04:05.56]How You love me
[04:08.21]How You love me
[04:12.13]
