[00:48.41]i love the dreaming when i think of

[01:00.05]
[01:01.89]i wonder what keeps us so high up
[01:08.91]could there be a love beneth these wings
[01:16.10]if we suddenly fall should i scream out

[02:30.49]the sky set out like a pathway
[02:37.61]but who decides which path we take
[02:44.81]as people drift into a dream world
[02:52.45]i close my eyes as my hands shake
[02:55.64]and when i see a new day

[03:40.71]well the earth beneth my body shake
[03:44.46]and cast your sleeping hearts awake
[03:47.56]could it tremble stars from moon light skies
[03:51.15]could it drag a tear from your cold eyes
