[00:35.00]I Wish I was in Carrickfergus
[00:43.33]Where she is waiting my rainbow's end
[00:51.26]I would swim over the deepest ocean
[01:00.09]Just to see her sweet smile again
[01:07.94]But the sea is wide and I cannot get over
[01:16.61]Nor have I the wings to fly
[01:24.48]I wish I knew a friendly boatman
[01:33.00]To ferry me back to my sweetheart's side
[01:41.73]
[01:57.72]I close my eyes and I remember
[02:06.06]The fields are green,and flowers gold
[02:14.41]Where we would walk on sunlit meadows
[02:22.77]Now my heart's longing to be back home
[02:30.67]But the sea is wide, and I cannot get over
[02:39.47]Nor have I the wings to fly
[02:47.22]So I'll just dream of Carrickfergus
[02:56.03]And the day I said goodbye
[03:04.28]Now and forever, my love and I
[03:28.55]So I'll just dream of Carrickfergus
[03:37.38]And the day I said goodbye
[03:45.78]Now and forever, my love and I
