[00:20.84]The summer wind, came blowin' in
[00:25.86]from across the sea
[00:31.45]It lingered there, to touch your hair
[00:36.81]and walk with me
[00:41.51]All summer long, we sang a song
[00:47.15]and then we strolled on that golden sand
[00:53.35]Two sweethearts, and the summer wind
[01:01.20]
[01:03.40]Like painted kites, those days and nights
[01:08.99]went flyin' by
[01:14.14]The world was new, beneath a blue
[01:19.42]umbrella sky
[01:25.30]Then softer than, a piper man
[01:30.28]one day it called to you
[01:37.55]And I lost you, to the summer wind
[01:44.56]
[01:46.97]The autumn wind, and the winter wind
[01:52.32]they have come and gone
[01:57.69]And still the days, those lonely days
[02:02.78]they go on and on
[02:08.54]And guess who sighs his lullabies
[02:13.37]through nights that never end
[02:19.37]My fickle friend, the summer wind
[02:28.55]
