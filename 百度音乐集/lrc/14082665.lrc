Last night your shadow
Fell upon my lonely dream
There's something in the air
I knew it wasn't real
The night was filled with love
The way it used to be
And then your hand reached out
To comfort me
Doro
Came the dawn
You were gone
You were gone, gone, gone
Chorus
I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream, last night
The room stood still
Can feel the words you said
And i still see your image
Racin' through my head
You touched my heart
Could feel your tenderness
You seemed so real
Just when you held out your hand
Came the dawn
You were gone, gone, gone
Chorus
