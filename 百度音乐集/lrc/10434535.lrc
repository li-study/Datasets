[00:12.50]Hey...oooh...
[00:24.50]Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
[00:36.50]Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
[00:49.50]All five horizons revolved around her soul
[00:59.50]As the earth to the sun
[01:02.50]Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
[01:13.50]Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
[01:25.50]Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore
[01:38.50]And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
[01:44.50]Of what was everything?
[01:48.50]Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...
[01:59.50]I take a walk outside
[02:04.50]I'm surrounded by some kids at play
[02:11.50]I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
[02:22.50]Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
[02:33.50]I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
[02:37.50]How quick the sun can, drop away
[02:47.50]And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
[02:53.50]Of what was everything?
[02:57.50]All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...
[03:06.50]All the love gone bad turned my world to black
[03:12.50]Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be...yeah...
[03:29.50]Uh huh...uh huh...ooh...
[03:38.50]I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star
[03:44.50]In somebody else's sky, but why
[03:49.50]Why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine
