[00:00.00]A Thousand Nights
[00:05.85]
[00:06.72]A thousand nights later memories linger
[00:18.81]The good the bad...I can touch them with my finger
[00:25.21]A thousand nights later I only got me
[00:30.85]No problem, no complaints; It's the way it should be
[00:41.06]Life was fast, It was free
[00:47.83]Guess I've been lucky
[00:50.66]Cause I'm still here...
[00:56.64]But some friends are gone
[01:00.31]Has it really been that long?
[01:03.20]The memories are still so beautiful
[01:09.39]When life's been unkind
[01:14.97]Those friends are on my mind
[01:19.04]Nothing's been greater here,
[01:21.37]Nothing's been greater here
[01:25.57]A thousand nights later
[01:34.38]For some of them it's such a lonely thing
[01:40.13]Haven't seen the future or luck life can bring
[01:47.55]Their body dies while their soul defies to live
[01:54.93]Haven't given all they'd like to give
[02:04.84]Life is cruel, It is kind
[02:10.20]Why is God calling them before their time?
[02:20.18]But some friends are gone
[02:24.00]Has it really been that long?
[02:27.25]The memories are still so beautiful
[02:34.05]When life's been unkind
[02:39.19]Those friends are on my mind
[02:42.79]Nothing's been greater here,
[02:46.18]Nothing's been greater here
[02:49.28]A thousand nights later
[02:51.83]Can you see me from the sky?
[02:55.45]Do you caress me when I cry?
[02:58.87]Cause I know you're still with me for all eternity
[03:07.46]But friends are gone
[03:11.59]Has it really been that long?
[03:15.84]The memories are still so beautiful
[03:21.40]When life's been unkind
[03:27.05]Those friends are on my mind
[03:30.89]Nothing's been greater here,
[03:32.75]Nothing's been greater here
[03:36.85]A thousand nights later
[03:45.83]Nothing feels greater here, Nothing feels greater here
[03:52.72]A thousand nights later
