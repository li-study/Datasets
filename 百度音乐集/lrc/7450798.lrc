[00:09.98]I wish I had much more time to show I love you baby
[00:15.35]But things have been so hectic ever since I'm in this game
[00:20.19]I'm thinking of you even though you are so far away
[00:25.03]Sometimes I really wish I could stay
[00:29.41]But nothing comes for free, I got everybody's eyes on me
[00:33.68]And this is where I have to be, I wish that you could be here baby
[00:38.81]All around the world, Even though I'm always on the road
[00:42.99]Even no matter where I go, Forever I'll be your girl
[00:48.59]All around the world, Hear me on the radio
[00:53.20]Catch me on a TV show, Forever I'll be your girl

[01:03.46]And there are things you wanna tell me but no time to say
[01:08.38]But there's a promise in the end it's gonna be okay,
[01:13.31]The love I have for you will never fade
[01:17.74]But nothing comes for free, I got everybody's eyes on me
