[00:21.18]There is something that I see

[00:28.18]There's a smile
[00:29.69]There's a truth in your eyes
[00:35.16]But an unexpected way
[00:38.50]On this unexpected day

[01:20.02]Afraid to show the other side
[01:23.46]Alone in the night without you
[01:29.87]
[01:30.14]But now I know just who you are
[01:33.88]And I know you hold my heart

[02:11.77]
[02:40.44]Over and over
[02:44.01]I'm filled with emotion
[02:47.61]Your love, it rushes
[02:50.81]Through my veins
[02:54.30]
[02:54.65]And I am filled
[02:58.02]With the sweetest devotion
[03:01.01]As I, I look into
[03:04.74]Your perfect face
[03:07.54]
[03:11.58]It's no more mystery
[03:14.66]It is finally clear to me
[03:18.15]You're the home my heart
[03:20.57]Searched for so long
[03:24.97]And it is you I have loved
