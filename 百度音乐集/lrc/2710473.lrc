[00:16.27]Imagine there's no heaven
[00:22.19]It's easy if you try
[00:29.30]No hell below us
[00:34.82]Above us only sky
[00:40.94]Imagine all the people
[00:46.43]Living for today
[00:53.19]Imagine there's no countries
[00:59.45]It isn't hard to do
[01:05.49]Nothing to kill or die for
[01:11.57]No religion too
[01:17.81]Imagine all the people
[01:23.44]Living life in peace
[01:28.14]Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
[01:30.67]You may say I'm a dreamer
[01:36.75]But I'm not the only one
[01:42.49]I hope some day you'll join us
[01:49.23]And the world will live as one
[01:54.80]Imagine no possessions
[02:00.69]I wonder if you can
[02:07.07]No need for greed or hunger
[02:13.11]A brotherhood of man
[02:19.16]Imagine all the people
[02:25.05]Sharing all the world
[02:29.54]Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
[02:32.24]You may say I'm a dreamer
[02:38.36]But I'm not the only one
[02:44.20]I hope some day you'll join us
[02:50.90]And the world will live as one.
