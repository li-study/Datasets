[00:25.11]Funny day
[00:26.41]looking for laughter and finding it there
[00:33.06]Sunny day
[00:34.92]braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
[00:41.48]Picked up a pencil and wrote
[00:44.99]"I love you" in my finest hand
[00:49.93]Wanted to send it
[00:52.01]but I don't know where I stand
[01:03.99]Telephone
[01:05.03]even the sound of your voice is still new
[01:11.86]All alone in California and talking to you
[01:19.48]And feeling too foolish and strange to
[01:24.06]say the words that I had planned
[01:28.76]I guess it's too early
[01:30.88]cause I don't know where I stand
[01:55.91]Crickets call
[01:57.02]courting their ladies in star-dappled green
[02:03.98]Thickets tall
[02:05.45]until the morning comes up like a dream
[02:11.39]All muted and misty
[02:14.55]so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
[02:20.26]I know that I miss you
[02:22.68]but I don't know where I stand
[02:28.85]I know that I miss you
[02:31.35]but I don't know where I stand
