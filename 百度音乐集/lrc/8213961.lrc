[00:07]Just about to tell you
[00:09]That I love him, I do
[00:13]I love him, I love him
[00:15]And I don't care what you think
[00:16]I love him for the man he wants to be
[00:19]And I love him for the man that he almost is
[00:23]I love him, I love him, I love him!
[00:28]She'll let you in her house
[00:32]If you come knockin' late at night
[00:38]She'll let you in her mouth
[00:43]If the words you say are right
[00:50]If you pay the price
[00:55]She'll let you deep inside
[00:59]But there's a secret garden she hides
[01:06]You've got to be fair to her
[01:08]She loves you
[01:09]If you don't love her,
[01:11]You've got to tell her
[01:12]She'll let you in her car
[01:18]To go drivin' 'round
[01:23]She'll let you into the parts of herself
[01:29]That'll bring you down
[01:34]She'll let you in her heart
[01:39]If you got a hammer and a vise
[01:44]But into her secret garden, don't think twice
[01:51]What if we got married?
[01:53]If I said that, would you stay?
[01:54]Oh, no, don't do that
[01:56]don't say that, unless
[01:57]You've gone a million miles
[02:00]Well, say it if you want to.
[02:02]How far'd you get
[02:05]Will you marry me?
[02:08]To that place where you can't remember
[02:11]What are you thinkin'?
[02:13]And you can't forget
[02:15]Laurel, we're getting married!
[02:18]She'll lead you down a path
[02:23]There'll be tenderness in the air
[02:29]She'll let you come just far enough
[02:34]So you know she's really there
[02:40]She'll look at you and smile
[02:46]And her eyes will say
[02:52]She's got a secret garden
[02:57]Where everything you want
[03:02]Where everything you need
[03:09]Will always stay
[03:13]A million miles away
[03:19]Do you, Jerry Maguire, take this woman
[03:22]to be your lawfully wedded wife?
[03:24]And do you, Dorothy Boyd, take this man
[03:27]to be your lawfully wedded husband?
[03:29]I now pronounce you husband and wife.
[03:34]I pretended that proposal by the car was real
[03:36]And it might've just been a hypothetical.
[03:39]I did this.
[03:41]And at least I can do something about it now
[03:44]So this break is a break-up.
[03:47]C'mon, Jerry, you know this isn't easy for me.
[03:53]Okay, if this is where it has to happen,
[03:56]This is where it has to happen.
[04:00]I'm not letting you get rid of me.
[04:03]How about that?
[04:04]I miss my wife.
[04:07]I love you.
[04:08]You...
[04:16]And I just
[04:17]Shut up, just shut up.
[04:21]You had me at hello.
[04:24]You had me at hello!
