[00:00.00]Tears Of Pearls
[00:09.94]Savage Garden
[00:18.98]And we stare each other down like victimes in the grind
[00:23.19]Prbig all the weakness and hurt still left behind and we cry
[00:30.18]The tears of pearls
[00:35.18]We do it Oh we do it
[00:43.30]Is love really the tragedy the way you might describe?
[00:47.57]Or would a thousand lovers still leave you cold inside?
[00:51.28]Make you cry...These tears of pearls
[01:03.48]All these mixed emotions we keep locked away like stolen pearls
[01:11.28]Stolen pearl devoeions we keep locked away from all the world
[01:19.79]Your kisses are like pearls,so different and so rare
[01:23.59]But anger stole the jewels away and love has left you bare
[01:27.29]Made you cry...
[01:30.08]These tears of pearls
[01:35.15]Well I could be the tired joker pour my heart to get you in
[01:39.16]Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win
[01:43.38]Maybe cry...
[01:45.98]These tears of pearls
[01:55.59]All these mixed emotions we keep locked away like stolen pearls
[02:03.54]Stolen pearl devotions we keep locked away from all the world
[02:11.55]We twist and turn where angels burn
[02:15.20]Like fallen soldiers we will learn
[02:19.08]That once forgotten,twice remoed
[02:23.15]Love will be the death...
[02:26.28]The death of you
[02:59.37][02:43.47]All these mixed emotions we keep locked away like stolen pearls
[03:07.44][02:50.95]Stolen pearl devotions we keep locked away from all the world
