[00:00.00]Brooks And Dunn - Indian Summer
[00:06.00]
[00:16.34]The tall weeds laid flat down
[00:20.76]On the hard, flat Kansas ground
[00:26.39]And the sad song in her head
[00:30.03]Kept blowing 'round
[00:32.86]
[00:36.42]She barely even knew his name
[00:41.10]But she liked the way he played the game
[00:46.61]Everybody cheered when he scored
[00:50.31]That last touchdown
[00:52.89]
[00:55.72]Indian summer
[00:59.36]The wonder, the hunger
[01:03.87]And the sound of distant thunder
[01:10.96]Indian summer
[01:15.75]
[01:17.30]Tangled in a moment of truth
[01:21.19]Bottle of wine in a motel room
[01:27.32]Blue haze circled 'round
[01:31.33]The cold, gray moon
[01:34.29]
[01:37.06]While the wind chased the leaves outside
[01:42.53]Passion found a place to hide
[01:47.56]Late September heat
[01:50.93]couldn't be denied
[01:54.16]
[01:56.09]Oh Indian summer
[01:59.82]The wonder, the hunger
[02:05.02]And the sound of distant thunder
[02:11.83]Indian summer
[02:17.12]
[02:33.11]She never even finished school
[02:37.36]People like to talk, they can be so cruel
[02:43.37]Her California was a place to start brand new
[02:50.15]
[02:53.01]So she left that dust bowl town
[02:58.55]Sometimes when the lone wind howls
[03:03.71]I wonder where we'd be
[03:05.86]If I never scored that last touchdown.
[03:12.29]
[03:17.27]Summer
[03:19.92]The wonder, the hunger
[03:24.26]And the sound of distant thunder
[03:31.49]Indian summer
[03:36.84]
[03:37.86]Ohhhhhhhhh
[03:45.86]
