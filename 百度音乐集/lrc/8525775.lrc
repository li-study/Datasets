[00:14.19]Like an old machine
[00:16.65]Sputtering along
[00:20.74]Wheels don't turn as fast as they used to
[00:27.09]Sometimes you take a right
[00:29.56]Find out that it's wrong
[00:33.63]Don't know the difference in a way
[00:38.58]It ain't for now and then
[00:42.54]Always help me find my way again
[00:52.94]Another restless day
[00:55.44]Looking for a sign
[00:59.63]Another wasted afternoon
[01:05.82]Maybe even though
[01:08.30]The thought is on my mind
[01:12.25]Don't mean that I won't see it soon
[01:17.02]It ain't for now and then
[01:21.15]Always help me find my way again
[01:26.81]So won't you roll on
[01:28.86]Sweet baby,roll on
[01:34.06]Roll on
[01:35.37]Sweet baby,roll on
[01:39.94]keep on rolling
[01:41.79]Sweet baby, roll on
[01:48.54]Lead the way again
[02:15.32]It ain't if  for now and then
[02:18.91]Always help me find my way again
[02:24.91]Won't you roll on
[02:26.84]Sweet baby, roll on
[02:32.10]Roll on
[02:33.28]Sweet baby, roll on
[02:37.79]Keep on rolling
[02:39.67]Sweet baby, roll on
