[00:03.37]
[00:05.66]It's cold around me, the night is young
[00:14.23]the sun has fallen and I've become
[00:20.68]the lonely one
[00:22.86]the moon is dancing among the clouds
[00:30.98]and my knees are shaking,
[00:33.02]and my dreams are braking!
[00:35.29]but I know I live
[00:37.34]But i know i live, today
[00:41.00]
[00:58.37][00:41.23]I know we could live tomorrow
[01:02.56][00:45.38]But I know I live today,
[01:06.90][00:49.75]I know we could live tomorrow
[01:11.15][00:54.04]But I don't think we should wait! No
[01:16.27]I know we could..
[01:18.96]
[01:20.67]Taking my life in my hands!
[01:24.38](the power who has it?)
[01:28.00]Taking my life in my hands!
[01:31.35](the power who has it?)
[01:45.49][01:37.50]I don't like to wait， no~no~
[01:49.97][01:41.65]It's happening, It's happening..
[01:52.27]
[02:29.00][02:11.47][01:54.89]I know we could live tomorrow
[02:32.71][02:15.52][01:58.79]But I know I live today,
[02:36.90][02:19.81][02:03.49]I know we could live tomorrow
[02:41.27][02:24.06][02:07.74]But I don't think we should wait !No
[02:54.52]
[03:00.47]La-la-la, love
