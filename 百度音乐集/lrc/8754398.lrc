[00:20.04]Blue is the color of love
[00:26.56]When your lover has gone from you
[00:31.76]Your heart is filled with longing to have new
[00:39.11]What came once from others　　
[00:43.36]When you open your heart for two
[00:48.87]But now it's true and you realize
[00:56.18]What illusion can do
[01:00.33]If you close your eyes
[01:04.36]But the dreaming is over now
[01:09.12]　　
[01:09.61]So blue is the color of you
[01:16.73]When you're waiting for someone who
[01:22.17]Will always make your dreams come true
[01:27.47]　　
[02:12.11]But now it's true and you realize
[02:19.70]What illusion can do
[02:23.77]If you close your eyes
[02:28.14]But the dreaming is over now　　
[02:33.24]So blue is the color of you
[02:40.29]When you're waiting for someone who
[02:45.81]Will always make your dreams come true
