[00:25]You could be my silver springs
[00:30]Blue green colors flashin'
[00:36]I would be your only dream
[00:41]Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
[00:51]And did you say she was pretty
[00:57]And did you say that she loves you
[01:03]Baby, I don't wanna know
[01:18]I'll begin not to love you
[01:24]Turn around, see me runnin'
[01:29]I'll say I loved you years ago
[01:35]Tell myself you never loved me, no
[01:45]And did you say she was pretty
[01:50]And did you say that she loves you
[01:56]Baby, I don't wanna know
[02:04]Oh, no
[02:08]And can you tell me was it worth it
[02:14]Really, I don't wanna know
[02:29]Time casts a spell on you, but you won't forget me
[02:39]I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me

[03:49]I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me
[04:47][04:23][04:00]I'll follow you down til' the sound of my voice will haunt you
[04:44][04:32]was I such a fool?
[04:35][04:12]You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you
[05:10]You could be my silver springs
[05:16]My blue green colors flashin'
[05:37]
[05:38]The End.
