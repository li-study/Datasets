[00:00.64]Cradle Of Filth
[00:03.75]
[00:04.68]sleepless
[00:05.71]
[00:06.82]And I often sigh
[00:13.06]I often wonder why
[00:20.94]I"m still here
[00:24.92]and I still cry
[00:34.77]And I often cry
[00:41.14]I often spill a tear
[00:48.75]Over those not here
[00:52.31]But still they are
[00:53.98]so near
[00:58.89]
[01:04.11]Please ease my burden
[01:11.64]
[01:16.09]And I still remember
[01:23.05]A memory and I weep
[01:29.30]In my broken sleep
[01:34.25]The scars they cut
[01:35.54]so deep
[01:45.03]Please ease my burden
[01:58.36]Please ease my pain
[02:11.21]
[02:26.76]Surely without war
[02:31.01]there would be no loss
[02:36.41]Hence no mourning,
[02:39.61]no grief
[02:42.56]no pain
[02:44.47]no misery
[02:49.60]No sleepless nights
[02:56.48]missing the dead ...
[02:59.09]Oh, no more
[03:04.44]No more war
[03:16.81]
