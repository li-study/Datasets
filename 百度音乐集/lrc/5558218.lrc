[00:30.02]You can holler, you can wail
[00:31.76]You can swing, you can flail
[00:33.69]You can fuck like a broken sail
[00:37.36]But I'll never give you up
[00:39.26]If I ever give you up
[00:41.08]My heart will surely fail
[00:44.40]
[01:00.71]And after all God can keep my soul
[01:04.17]England have my bones
[01:07.42]But don't ever give me up
[01:09.27]I could never get back up
[01:11.18]When the future starts so slow
[01:15.04]
[01:16.21]No longing for the moonlight
[01:18.02]No longing for the sun
[01:19.88]No longer will I curse the bad I've done
[01:23.74]If there's a time when your feelings gone
[01:27.57]I wanna feel it
[01:29.42]
[01:30.89]You can holler, you can wail
[01:32.76]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[01:38.35]You can swing, you can flail
[01:40.23]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[01:43.47](I don't mind)
[01:44.92]
[02:16.63]There's a time for the second best
[02:21.85]And there's a time when the feeling's gone
[02:31.23]But it's hard to be hard I guess
[02:36.96]When you're shaking like a dog
[02:42.95]
[03:00.69]You can holler, you can wail
[03:02.76]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:08.36]You can swing, you can flail
[03:10.23]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:13.37]
[03:15.84]You can holler, you can wail
[03:17.76]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:23.33]You can swing, you can flail
[03:25.25]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:28.51](I don't mind)
[03:29.90]
[03:30.91]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:34.60]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:38.34]You can holler, you can wail
[03:40.24]You can blow what's left of my right mind
[03:43.25]
