[00:03.07]I Told You So-Carrie Underwood
[00:06.68]
[00:11.70]Verse 1
[00:13.90]Suppose I called you up tonight
[00:18.19]And told you that I love you
[00:20.29]And suppose I said I want to come back home
[00:26.78]And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
[00:33.52]And Im tired of spending all my time alone
[00:39.58]If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
[00:46.01]And it's killing me to be so far away
[00:52.58]Would you tell me that you love me too
[00:56.12]And would we cry together
[00:59.47]Or would you simply laugh at me and say...
[01:04.41]
[01:04.98]Chorus
[01:05.35]I told you so, I told you so
[01:18.53]I told you some day you'd come crawling back
[01:23.03]And asking me to take you in
[01:31.48]I told you so, but you had to go
[01:44.12]Now I've found somebody new
[01:46.98]And you will never break my heart in two again
[01:55.31]
[02:01.09]Verse 2
[02:03.94]If I got down on my knees
[02:06.42]And told you I was yours forever
[02:10.42]Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
[02:16.95]Would we get that old-time feeling
[02:20.43]Would we laugh and talk for hours
[02:23.81]The way we did when our love first began
[02:29.84]Would you tell me that you've missed me too
[02:33.13]And that you've been so lonely
[02:36.37]And you've waited for the day that I returned
[02:42.73]And we'd live and love forever
[02:46.06]And that Im your one and only
[02:49.75]Or would you say the tables finally turned
[02:55.37]And would you say...
[02:55.97]I told you so, I told you so
[03:08.68]I told you some day you'd come crawling back
[03:13.11]And asking me to take you in
[03:21.76]I told you so, but you had to go
[03:34.32]Now I've found somebody new
[03:37.19]And you will never break my heart in two again
[03:54.67](chorus)
