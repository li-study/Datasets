[00:22.65]If you wish I'll sing you something special
[00:30.92]Anything to please you
[00:37.96]And if it works well we will have a new song
[00:44.29]A new song that is just for you
[00:50.91]I will sing you blue sky and ocean
[00:59.36]And a slow boat to sail on
[01:05.65]And I'll sing you sun and breezeand above
[01:11.70]all these little things
[01:15.40]I'll sing you love
[01:23.67]
[01:26.43]I can't make your tears go away
[01:34.16]Nor pu a stop to all frustrating days
[01:40.39]Everything fades no matter good or bad
[01:47.24]But if you remember,this song will last
[02:01.12]I will sing you blue sky and ocean
[02:10.14]And a slow boat to sail on
[02:16.49]And I'll sing you sun and breezeand above
[02:22.18]all these little things
[02:26.02]I'll sing you love
[02:33.84]
[03:22.92]I can't make your tears go away
[03:30.62]Nor pu a stop to all frustrating days
[03:36.95]Everything fades no matter good or bad
[03:43.69]But if you remember,this song will last
[03:59.21]I will sing you blue sky and ocean
[04:06.40]And a slow boat to sail on
[04:13.28]And there will be sun and breeze in this song
[04:19.20]every time we sing it
[04:22.53]When we sing love
[04:31.21]
