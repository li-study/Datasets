[00:13.95]What a wonderful hesitation
[00:17.78]who would bear to feel sorry for me
[00:23.07]dropped another pill just to calm me
[00:27.21]collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
[00:32.24]there I was drifting
[00:34.19]way out into the sunshine
[00:38.62]expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
[00:43.36]look at me I'm a tangled puppet
[00:47.90]I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
[00:53.23]find myself awake counting sad days
[00:58.17]1-2-3 that's too many for me
[01:03.31]dropped another pill just to find me
[01:07.37]reached for my hand but it was already there
[01:12.43]then I started believin'
[01:14.41]that I fell out of a tiny raindrop
[01:18.89]that lost its way when I decided to roam
[01:23.59]chasing me was a hungry dweller
[01:28.12]but I had escaped it by pretending to die
[01:33.98]come follow me you won't expect the illusion
[01:40.05]you'll see it's my imagination
[01:45.04]hand me your eyes
[01:48.39]I will put them in front of mine
[01:53.11]you'll see a little better
[01:57.17]you'll see a little better
[02:32.84]
[02:35.77]what a wonderful destination
[02:37.08]where I am now
[02:39.17]I can no longer see
[02:42.34]dropped another pill just to kill me
[02:46.05]collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
[02:51.34]there I was there I was there I was drifting
[02:57.79]way out into the sunshine
[03:02.41]expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
[03:06.39]look at me I'm a tangled puppet
[03:10.73]I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
[03:15.37]but I had escaped it by pretending to die
