[00:01.42]What I'Ve Done
[00:03.62]Linkin Park
[00:05.64]
[00:41.05]In this farewell
[00:44.36]There's no blood
[00:46.35]There's no alibi
[00:49.34]'Cause I've drawn regret
[00:52.30]From the truth
[00:54.33]Of a thousand lies
[00:57.39]So let mercy come
[01:00.70]And wash away
[01:05.09]What I've done
[01:08.99]I'll face myself
[01:11.44]To cross out what I've become
[01:16.91]Erase myself
[01:19.48]And let go of what I've done
[01:24.49]Put to rest
[01:26.29]What you thought of me
[01:29.24]While I clean this slate
[01:32.39]With the hands of uncertainty
[01:37.31]So let mercy come
[01:40.92]And wash away
[01:45.00]What I've done
[01:48.89]I'll face myself
[01:51.41]To cross out what I've become
[01:56.95]Erase myself
[01:59.43]And let go of what I've done
[02:10.79]
[02:20.10]For what I've done
[02:24.94]I start again
[02:27.41]And whatever pain may come
[02:32.92]Today this ends
[02:35.37]I'm forgiving what I've done
[02:42.87]I'll face myself
[02:45.34]To cross out what I've become
[02:50.88]Erase myself
[02:53.30]And let go of what I've done
[03:02.99]What I've done
[03:09.54]Forgiving what I've done
