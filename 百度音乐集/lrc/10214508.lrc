[00:12.84]My friends feel it's their appointed duty
[00:24.10]They keep trying to tell me
[00:29.17]All you want to do is use me
[00:36.09]Ha, ha, but my answer, ha, ha
[00:41.49]Yeah, to all that use me stuff
[00:48.20]Is I wanna spread the news
[00:52.32]That if it feels this good getting used
[00:55.32]Oh, you just keep on using me
[00:58.21]Until you use me up
[01:11.17]Until you use me up
[01:13.47]
[01:14.64]My brother, sit me right down
[01:20.94]And he talked to me, ah-ha
[01:26.77]He told me, ah-ha
[01:31.64]That I ought not to let you just walk on me
[01:38.86]And I'm sure he meant well
[01:45.31]Yeah, but when our talk was through
[01:52.00]I-I-I said brother, if you only knew
[01:54.52]You'd wish that you were in my shoes
[01:57.78]You just keep on using me
[02:00.46]Until you use me up
[02:06.68]
[02:09.97]Until you use me up
[02:12.09]
[02:16.65]Oh sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me
[02:29.49]You get in a crowd of high class people
[02:34.48]And then you act real rude to me
[02:38.48]But oh baby, baby, baby, baby
[02:46.55]When you love me I can't get enough
[02:52.74]I-I and I, wanna spread the news
[02:56.63]That if it feels this good getting used
[02:59.35]Oh, you just keep on using me
[03:05.29]Until you use me up
[03:06.58]
[03:12.18]Until you use me up
[03:14.53]
[03:18.97]Talking about you using me
[03:21.39]But it all depends on what you do
[03:24.94]It ain't too bad the way you're using me
[03:27.64]'Cause I sure am using you
[03:30.29]To do the things you do
[03:30.83]Ah-ha, to do the things you do
