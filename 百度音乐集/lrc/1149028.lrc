
[00:00.81]I Cry
[00:05.20]Shayne Ward
[00:11.60]
[00:17.60]You said goodbye
[00:19.96]I fell apart
[00:23.51]I fell from all we had
[00:27.83]To I never knew
[00:30.32]I needed you so bad
[00:33.16]
[00:33.91]You need to let things go
[00:39.01]I know, you told me so
[00:43.27]I've been through hell
[00:45.76]To break the spell
[00:47.39]
[00:48.73]Why did I ever let you slip away
[00:53.74]Can't stand another day without you
[00:58.15]Without the feeling
[01:00.55]I once knew
[01:02.20]
[01:03.63]I cry silently
[01:07.66]I cry inside of me
[01:11.40]I cry hopelessly
[01:14.58]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
[01:19.68]I cry
[01:20.67]Cause you're not here with me
[01:23.28]I cry
[01:23.94]Cause I'm lonely as can be
[01:27.03]I cry hopelessly
[01:30.04]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
[01:36.95]
[01:37.86]If you could see me now
[01:42.95]You would know just how
[01:47.34]How hard I try
[01:49.05]Not to wonder why
[01:51.30]
[01:52.22]I wish I could believe in something new
[01:56.10]Oh please somebody tell me it's not true (oh girl)
[02:01.98]I'll never be over you
[02:05.85]
[02:07.69]Why did I ever let you slip away
[02:12.48]Can't stand another day without you
[02:17.43]Without the feeling
[02:19.56]I once knew
[02:20.84]
[02:21.29]I cry silently
[02:26.47]I cry inside of me
[02:30.39]I cry hopelessly
[02:33.54]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
[02:38.19]I cry
[02:39.48]Cause you're not here with me
[02:41.97]I cry
[02:43.47]Cause I'm lonely as can be
[02:46.20]I cry hopelessly
[02:49.25]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
[02:53.94]
[02:58.27]If I could have you back tomorrow
[03:01.87]If I could lose the pain and sorrow
[03:06.18]I would do just anything
[03:09.12]To make you see
[03:10.61]You still love me
[03:14.34]
[03:34.36]I cry silently
[03:38.52]I cry inside of me
[03:42.22]I cry hopelessly
[03:45.24]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
[03:50.13]I cry
[03:51.36]Cause you're not here with me
[03:53.99]I cry
[03:55.01]Cause I'm lonely as can be
[03:58.05]I cry hopelessly
[04:00.40]Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
