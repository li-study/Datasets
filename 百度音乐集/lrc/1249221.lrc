[00:10.08]I open my eyes,
[00:12.13]I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light
[00:19.84]I can't remember how, I can't remember why
[00:25.73]I'm lying here tonight
[00:30.47]And I can't stand the pain
[00:35.71]And I can't make it go away
[00:40.78]No I can't stand the pain
[00:47.11]How could this happen to me?
[00:50.31]I made my mistakes
[00:52.77]Got no where to run
[00:55.39]The night goes on as I'm fading away
[01:00.52]I'm sick of this life
[01:02.89]I just wanna scream
[01:07.11]How could this happen to me?
[01:14.81]Everybody's screaming
[01:17.06]I try to make a sound but no one hears me
[01:24.96]I'm slipping off the edge, I'm hanging by a thread
[01:30.08]I wanna start this over again
[01:35.24]So I try to hold onto a time where nothing mattered
[01:46.20]And I can't explain what happened
[01:50.85]And I can't erase the things I've done
[02:00.62]No I can't
[02:04.60]How could this happen to me?
[02:07.84]I made my mistakes
[02:10.25]Got no where to run
[02:12.77]The night goes on as I'm fading away
[02:17.91]I'm sick of this life
[02:20.41]I just wanna scream
[02:24.55]How could this happen to me?
[02:58.70]I made my mistakes
[03:01.06]Got no where to run
[03:03.60]The night goes on as I'm fading away
[03:08.76]I'm sick of this life
[03:11.23]I just wanna scream
[03:15.39]How could this happen to me?
