[00:10.27]Love  changed  our loney  lives
[00:19.12]Caught  us  by  surprise
[00:23.34]Opened  up  our  eyes
[00:28.36]Somehow  we  both  knew
[00:32.99]Something  rare  and  true
[00:37.70]Something   bright  and  new
[00:42.70]Could  be  ours  forever
[00:47.40]But  love
[00:52.28]Love  can  not  be  planned
[00:57.12]More  you  try  to  learn
[01:01.89]Less  you  understand
[01:06.83]Words  could  not  dispell
[01:11.53]What  we  know  so  well
[01:16.44]O nly  time  will  tell
[01:30.55]Like  a  tree
[01:34.49]As  it  grows
[01:38.48]We  will  reach
[01:42.62]For  the  sky
[01:46.75]Like   a  breeze
[01:50.69]Gently  blows
[01:55.04]We"ll  be  free
[01:58.75]You  and  I
[02:03.04]For  we  know
[02:06.89]Time  alone
[02:11.16]Holds  the  key
[02:21.98]Love  cnanged  our loney  lives
[02:30.01]Caught  us  by  surprise
[02:34.85]Opened  up  our  eyes
