[00:05.46]
[00:28.08]One summer night the stars were shining bright
[00:33.66]One summer dream made with fancy whims
[00:39.27]That summer night my whole world tumbled down
[00:44.11]I could have died if not for you
[00:48.51]Each night I pray for you
[00:52.44]my heart would cry for you
[00:55.17]The sun don't shine again since you have gone
[00:59.92]Each time I think of you
[01:03.76]my heart would beat for you
[01:06.54]You are the one for me
[01:12.85]
[01:16.08]Set me free like the sparrows up the tree
[01:21.77]Give a sign so I would ease my mind
[01:27.45]Just say a word and I'll come running wild
[01:32.06]Give me a chance to live again.
[01:36.60]Each night I pray for you
[01:40.46]my heart would beat for you
[01:43.38]The sun don't shine again since you have gone
[01:47.99]Each time I think of you
[01:51.80]my heart would beat for you
[01:54.64]You are the one for me
[02:01.15]
[02:01.51]One summer night the stars were shining bright
[02:07.03]One summer dream made with fancy whims
[02:12.65]That summer night my whole world tumbled down
[02:17.49]I could have died if not for you
[02:22.02]Each night I pray for you
[02:25.88]my heart would cry for you
[02:28.77]The sun don't shine again since you have gone
[02:33.37]Each time I think of you
[02:37.23]my heart would beat for you
[02:40.10]You are the one for me
[02:48.43]
