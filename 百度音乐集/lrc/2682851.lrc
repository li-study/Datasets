[00:00.00]Anberlin - Paperthin Hymn
[00:22.20]When your only friends are hotel rooms
[00:25.33]Hands are distant lullabies
[00:28.33]If I could turn around I would tonight
[00:32.63]These roads never seemed so long
[00:35.29]Since your paper heart stopped beating leaving me suddenly alone
[00:40.54]Will daybreak ever come?
[00:43.68]Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
[00:46.79]Who's gonna drive you home?
[00:48.56]I just want one more chance
[00:50.96]To put my arms in fragile hands
[00:53.93]I thought you said forever
[00:55.99]Over and over
[00:58.94]A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion
[01:04.48]These thoughts run through my head
[01:06.49]Over and over
[01:09.60]Complaints of violins become my only friends
[01:18.25]August evenings
[01:20.11]Bring solemn warnings
[01:21.94]To remember
[01:23.68]to kiss the ones you love goodnight
[01:28.42]You never know what temporal days may bring
[01:31.77]So Laugh, love, live free, and sing
[01:35.27]When life is in discord
[01:37.36]Praise ye the Lord
[01:44.72]Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
[01:47.98]Who's gonna drive you home?
[01:49.74]I just want one more chance
[01:52.26]To put my arms in fragile hands
[01:55.07]I thought you said forever
[01:57.27]Over and over
[02:00.10]A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion
[02:05.58]These thoughts run through my head
[02:07.71]Over and over
[02:11.04]Complaints of violins become my only friends
[02:21.32]Friends
[02:42.95]I thought you said forever
[02:44.99]Over and over
[02:48.72]A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion
[02:53.29]These thoughts run through my head
[02:55.52]Over and over
[02:58.82]Complaints of violins become my only friends
[03:04.19]I thought you said forever
[03:06.27]Over and over
[03:09.21](And over and over)
[03:10.00]These thoughts run through my head
