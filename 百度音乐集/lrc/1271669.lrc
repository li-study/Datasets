[00:00.03]Candle In The Wind - by Elton John
[00:09.15]goodbye england's rose
[00:12.04]may you ever grow in our hearts
[00:15.30]you were the grace that placed itself
[00:18.77]where lives were torn apart
[00:23.58]you called out to our country
[00:27.55]and you whispered to those in pain
[00:30.88]now you belong to heaven
[00:33.81]and the stars spell out your name
[00:39.81]and it seems to me you lived your life
[00:43.46]like a candle in the wind
[00:47.31]never fading with the sunset
[00:50.98]when the rain set in
[00:54.81]and your footsteps will always fall here
[00:58.38]along england's greenest hills
[01:02.44]your candle's burned out long before
[01:08.22]your legend ever will
[01:11.80]
[01:23.66]loveliness we've lost
[01:26.78]these empty days without your smile
[01:29.81]this torch we'll always carry
[01:33.01]for our nation's golden child
[01:38.64]and even though we try
[01:43.45]the truth brings us to tears
[01:45.99]all our words cannot express
[01:49.16]the joy you brought us through the years
[01:55.00]and it seems to me you lived your life
[01:58.45]like a candle in the wind
[02:02.27]never fading with the sunset
[02:06.14]when the rain set in
[02:10.01]and your footsteps will always fall here
[02:13.29]along england's greenest hills
[02:17.57]your candle's burned out long before
[02:23.12]your legend ever will
[02:26.32]
[02:38.80]goodbye england's rose
[02:41.69]may you ever grow in our hearts
[02:45.01]you were the grace that placed itself
[02:48.43]where lives were torn apart
[02:54.59]goodbye england's rose
[02:56.67]from a country lost without your soul
[03:00.36]who'll miss the wings of your compassion
[03:03.57]more than you'll ever know
[03:09.29]and it seems to me you lived your life
[03:11.46]like a candle in the wind
[03:17.09]never fading with the sunset
[03:20.81]when the rain set in
[03:24.58]and your footsteps will always fall here
[03:27.91]along england's greenest hills
[03:32.20]your candle's burned out long before
[03:37.94]your legend ever will
[03:41.74]
[03:45.47]your footsteps will always fall here
[03:48.67]along england's greenest hills
[03:52.88]your candle's burned out long before
[03:58.74]your legend ever will
