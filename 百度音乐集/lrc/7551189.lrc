[00:16.10]Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
[00:18.50]Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
[00:21.88]with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
[00:30.20]Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
[00:35.83]a girl with caleidoscope eyes.
[00:45.63]Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
[00:51.99]towering over your head.
[00:58.05]Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
[01:03.12]and she's gone.
[01:07.23]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[01:11.66]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[01:15.96]Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah.
[01:34.86]Follow her downto a bridge by the fountain,
[01:40.53]where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
[01:48.87]Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
[01:54.58]that grow so incredibly high.
[02:04.33]Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
[02:10.49]waiting to take you away.
[02:16.77]Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
[02:21.92]and you're gone.
[02:26.17]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[02:30.41]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[02:34.71]Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah.
[02:54.07]Picture yourself on a train in a station,
[02:57.02]with plasticine porters with looking glass ties.
[03:01.37]Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
[03:04.32]the girl with caleidoscope eyes.
[03:13.34]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[03:17.59]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[03:21.90]Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah.
[03:30.52]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[03:34.82]Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
[03:39.12]Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah.
[03:47.67]Lucy in the sky
[03:51.93]Lucy in the sky
[03:56.18]Lucy in the sky
[04:00.49]Lucy in the sky
