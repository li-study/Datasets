[00:00.00]Elvis Presley - In The Ghetto
[00:03.25]
[00:05.25]As the snow flies
[00:10.76]On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
[00:13.71]A poor little baby child is born
[00:16.27]In the ghetto
[00:18.29]
[00:21.65]And his mama cries
[00:27.26]'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
[00:29.93]It's another hungry mouth to feed
[00:32.72]In the ghetto
[00:34.28]
[00:37.89]People, don't you understand
[00:40.35]The child needs a helping hand
[00:43.75]Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
[00:48.59]Take a look at you and me,
[00:51.15]Are we too blind to see,
[00:54.60]Do we simply turn our heads
[00:57.61]And look the other way
[01:00.58]
[01:01.70]Well the world turns
[01:07.47]And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
[01:10.51]Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
[01:12.92]In the ghetto
[01:14.77]
[01:18.26]And his hunger burns
[01:23.73]So he starts to roam the streets at night
[01:26.50]And he learns how to steal
[01:27.71]And he learns how to fight
[01:29.04]In the ghetto
[01:31.34]
[01:34.86]Then one night in desperation
[01:37.46]The young man breaks away
[01:40.04]He buys a gun, steals a car,
[01:43.01]Tries to run, but he don't get far
[01:46.08]And his mama cries
[01:49.60]
[01:52.34]As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
[01:54.82]Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
[01:57.49]In the ghetto
[01:59.41]
[02:02.81]And as her young man dies,
[02:08.49]On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
[02:11.25]Another little baby child is born
[02:15.26]In the ghetto
[02:18.45]
[02:21.24]And his mama cries
[02:27.07]
