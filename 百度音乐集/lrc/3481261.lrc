[00:00.00]My Immortal
[00:04.82]Evanescence
[00:08.33]
[00:13.63]I'm so tired of being here
[00:20.02]Suppressed by all my childish fears
[00:26.03]And if you have to leave
[00:29.51]I wish that you would just leave
[00:32.82]'Cause your presence still lingers here
[00:36.08]And it won't leave me alone
[00:39.51]These wounds won't seem to heal
[00:42.82]This pain is just too real
[00:46.02]There's just too much that time cannot erase
[00:51.84]When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
[00:58.24]When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
[01:04.62]I held your hand through all of these years
[01:11.29]But you still have
[01:15.93]
[01:18.15]All of me
[01:22.76]
[01:33.25]You used to captivate me
[01:37.01]By your resonating light
[01:40.06]Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
[01:46.43]Your face it haunts
[01:49.43]My once pleasant dreams
[01:53.06]Your voice it chased away
[01:56.05]All the sanity in me
[01:59.84]These wounds won't seem to heal
[02:03.10]This pain is just too real
[02:06.29]There's just too much that time cannot erase
[02:12.07]When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
[02:18.31]When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
[02:24.39]I held your hand through all of these years
[02:30.62]But you still have
[02:36.55]
[02:38.19]All of me
[02:41.62]I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
[02:52.12]But though you're still with me
[02:58.97]I've been alone all along
[03:07.02]
[03:19.54]When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
[03:25.39]When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
[03:32.68]I held your hand through all of these years
[03:37.20]But you still have
[03:44.07]
[03:46.92]All of me...
