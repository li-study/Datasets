[al:playing my game]

[00:28.45]So I see it, it's right there in front of me
[00:34.25]What's a matter, oh you cannot see
[00:39.73]Feeling like I did when you blindfolded me
[00:46.30]So I hear it, for a brief moment there I thought I knew
[00:52.21]All these things they were far, far from true
[00:58.76]But I guess you cannot hide from the truth.
[01:09.58]So I see right through you
[01:16.99]And I know what you've been up to
[01:24.10]So I see right through you
[01:30.10]And I know the things you do.
[01:36.32]So I see it, it's right there in front of me.
[01:42.23]Oh, I'm sorry,
[01:44.15]You did not wanna see
[01:47.66]Acting like I did when you betrayed me
[01:54.77]So I hear it, they didn't have to scream it in my head
[02:00.31]They just could have whispered it instead
[02:06.05]Cause I am already over it now.
[02:18.08]So I see right through you
[02:24.41]And I know what you've been up to
[02:30.96]So I see right through you
[02:36.64]And I know the things you do.
