[00:01.08]Cross Every River
[00:02.59]Maria Arredondo
[00:04.49]
[00:13.28]as I sit here all quiet
[00:16.08]I wonder why were apart
[00:19.14]and the noise from the city
[00:22.16]cuts a hole thru the dark
[00:25.40]as the night time as fallen
[00:28.68]and the day flies away
[00:31.94]can you hear me I'm calling
[00:34.93]can you hear me I say
[00:38.15]and I would cross every river
[00:41.30]I would sail every sea
[00:44.38]I would climb every mountain
[00:47.68]if it would bring you back to me
[00:50.56]I would part every ocean
[00:54.07]I would catch every star
[00:56.90]I would cross every river
[01:00.21]to be right where you are
[01:04.24]
[01:09.69]baby lower your shoulders
[01:12.90]and relax for a while
[01:15.86]you have been running for ages
[01:19.19]you have run all ur life
[01:22.10]but u know there will 
[01:24.33]always be apart of u here
[01:28.36]so wherever life takes you
[01:31.73]you'll always be near
[01:34.79]and I would cross every river
[01:38.03]I would sail every sea
[01:41.12]I would climb every mountain
[01:44.46]if it would bring you back to me
[01:47.30]I would part every ocean
[01:50.86]I would catch every star
[01:53.72]I would cross every river
[01:57.02]to be wherever you are
[02:01.04]
[02:07.37]many thing I should have done
[02:10.90]many miles I should have run
[02:13.98]many fights I should have won
[02:16.94]
[02:20.56]and if the skies fall down 2nite
[02:23.42]and all is lost no hope in sight
[02:26.61]I think of you and I'm alright
[02:30.54]and I will……
[02:32.91]cross every river
[02:35.16]I would sail every sea
[02:38.10]I would climb every mountain
[02:41.14]if it would bring you back to me
[02:44.34]I would part every ocean
[02:47.47]I would catch every star
[02:50.58]I would cross every river
[02:53.76]to be right where you are
[02:57.84]
[03:03.70]I would climb every mountain
[03:06.80]if it would bring you back to me
[03:09.72]I would part every ocean
[03:12.78]I would catch every star
[03:15.90]I would cross every river
[03:19.09]to be right where you are
[03:25.31]to be right where you are
