About situation I'm pretty sure y'all be able to relate to
Trust me
Today I'm not feelin pretty
See I'm feeling quite ugly
Havin one of this days
When I cant make up the ??
So don't even look at me
See I don't wanna hear your problem
Cause I'm having some of my own
I know it was not your fault
That I'm feelin down
I just wanna be left alone
Down I'm now in depression
I think the worst of everything
My low was back and seeking
And my close don't feel
Now aint that a bitch
Got an attitude and I aint talkin to you
Won't to you if the shoe fill
I don't care what you think about me
I don't need you cry around me
