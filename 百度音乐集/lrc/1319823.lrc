[00:09.43]I'm wishing on a star, to follow where you are
[00:20.74]I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means
[00:32.00]I'm wishing on the rainbows, that i've seen
[00:37.47]I'm wishing on the people who, really dream
[00:43.14]I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
[00:48.58]I'm wishing on all of the things, we've never done
[00:53.49]
[00:54.16]I never thought i'd see, the time where you would be
[01:04.89]So far away from home, so far away from me
[01:15.96]Just think of all the moments, that we spent
[01:21.37]I just cant let you go, for me, you were meant
[01:27.14]And I didn't mean to hurt you, but i know
[01:32.54]In the game of love you reap what you sow
[01:40.09]I feel its time we should make up, baby
[01:45.52]I feel its time for us to get back together
[01:50.46]And make the best of things oh baby when we're together
[01:56.66]
[01:58.85]Whether or never
[02:05.20]
[02:05.61]I'm wishing on a star, wishing on a star
[02:11.26]To follow where you are, a-a-a-are
[02:16.65]I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means
[02:27.96]And I wish upon the rainbows that I've seen
[02:33.08]I'm wishing on the people who, really dream
[02:38.68]And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
[02:44.19]I'm wishing on all the things that we, we never to-o-o-old!
[02:51.96]
[02:52.35]I'm wishing on a star (Oh wishing on a star)
[02:58.35]To follow where you are (Oh anywhere you go)
[03:03.66]I'm wishing on a star (I'm wishing on a star)
[03:09.16]To follow where you are (To where you, where you go)
[03:13.16]I'm wishing on a star.
