[00:04.24]
[00:12.23]Eyes like fire - Burn desire
[00:17.59]As we dance away into the night
[00:22.31]
[00:23.54]This attraction - Fuels a passion
[00:29.30]That's just too strong for us to try and fight
[00:33.75]
[00:35.03]Each moment we're together
[00:37.40]I just never want to end
[00:40.67]'Cause I could never feel this way again
[00:44.65]
[00:45.79]'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
[00:49.26]To feel your body lying next to mine
[00:51.34]As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
[00:55.74]All through the night
[00:57.63]I never thought I'd ever realize
[01:00.23]A long that feels so close to paradise
[01:03.63]Boy I could spend my whole life living
[01:06.87]Forever in our eyes
[01:11.62]
[01:15.85]Lips so tender - I surrender
[01:21.41]Everything I am is yours alone
[01:26.50]
[01:27.39]When you tough me - All that I see
[01:32.93]Fire feeling that my heart has never known
[01:38.12]
[01:38.87]You're all I ever dreamed of
[01:41.38]you're my every fantasy
[01:44.55]Whoever thought on angel could bring heaven here to me
[01:49.33]
[01:50.10]'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
[01:52.50]To feel your body lying next to mine
[01:56.17]As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
[01:59.63]All through the night
[02:01.40]I never thought I'd ever realize
[02:04.04]A long that feels so close to paradise
[02:07.27]Boy I could spend my whole life living
[02:11.80]Forever in our eyes
[02:15.13]You're the one my heart beats for
[02:17.75]You're my everything and more
[02:21.09]It's a burnin' love I can't seem to ignore
[02:25.85]All the things I feel inside
[02:29.19]Are too strong for me to hide (baby)
[02:33.15]I need you by my side
[02:36.14]'Cause I could live forever in your eyes
[02:41.11]'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
[02:42.27]To feel your body lying next to mine
[02:44.99]As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
[02:48.77]All through the night
[02:50.50]I never thought I'd ever realize
[02:53.25]A long that feels so close to paradise
[02:56.26]Boy I could spend my whole life living
[03:01.08]Forever in our eyes
