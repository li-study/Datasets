[00:00.00]
[00:00.50]Listen to me now
[00:03.28]Won't you take every word in?
[00:07.04]I'm saying this out loud
[00:10.33]You don't have to pretend
[00:12.79]It only took a couple minutes
[00:15.28]Just to figure it out
[00:20.23]We can do anything
[00:22.23]If we live life without a doubt
[00:26.73]
[00:27.30]Some people hope to find
[00:31.06]Something extraordinary in
[00:34.28]Turning one page at a time
[00:38.04]Only one way to begin
[00:41.11]It looks like we are having
[00:43.36]Let you play in this game
[00:48.60]You can force the piece to fit
[00:50.36]But the puzzle is not the same
[00:53.81]Oh the same
[00:56.80]
[00:56.91]So we're gonna sing it now
[01:00.27]Until the very last light goes out
[01:03.76]Then we're gonna close our mouths
[01:07.20]And listen to hear, listen to hear ourselves
[01:11.50]
[01:11.80]Echo off the sky tonight
[01:17.62]
[01:19.39]This is what life could be like
[01:22.76]
[01:35.70]Don't feel sorry if you don't
[01:39.13]Play the melody just right
[01:42.83]Just promise me you'll try
[01:45.48]And try it again, it'll be all right
[01:48.48]Sometimes I think that I'm running out
[01:51.05]Of air or lose my breath
[01:55.69]It's better than sew it up
[01:58.23]This sad song inside my head
[02:02.28]
[02:03.36]So we're gonna sing it now
[02:06.27]Until the very last light goes out
[02:09.68]Then we're gonna close our mouths
[02:13.15]And listen to hear, listen to hear ourselves
[02:17.59]
[02:17.86]Echo off the sky tonight
[02:23.63]
[02:25.70]This is what life could be like
[02:30.11]
[02:31.52]I find the world in his fingers
[02:37.07]He won't let me fall, let me fall
[02:46.15]He is, he is speaking
[02:51.11]You're not at fall, heâ€™s played it all
[02:58.37]
[02:58.57]So we're gonna sing it now
[03:06.98]Close our mouths
[03:09.19]Listen to hear ourselves
[03:12.46]
[03:13.82]Sing it now
[03:15.99]Until the very last light goes out
[03:19.36]Then we're gonna close our mouths
[03:22.79]And listen to hear, listen to hear ourselves
[03:27.18]
[03:27.58]Echo off the sky tonight
[03:33.08]
[03:35.26]This is what life could be like
[03:39.42]
[03:45.34]This is what life could be like
[03:52.40]
