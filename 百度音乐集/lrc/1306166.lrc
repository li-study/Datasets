[00:00.10]John Mayer - City Love
[00:00.20]
[00:00.60]I never liked this apple much
[00:07.49]It always seemed too big to touch
[00:14.55]I can't remember how I found
[00:21.59]My way before she came around
[00:26.26]I tell everyone
[00:30.06]I smile just because
[00:33.48]I've got a city love
[00:36.92]I found it in Lydia
[00:41.47]And I can't remember life before her name
[00:47.25]
[00:49.71]She keeps a toothbrush at my place
[00:56.88]As if I had the extra space
[01:03.78]She steals my clothes to wear to work
[01:11]I know - her hairs are on my shirts
[01:15.82]I tell everyone
[01:19.51]I smile just because
[01:22.91]I've got a city love
[01:26.15]I found it in Lydia
[01:30.88]And I can't remember life before
[01:34.99]The day
[01:36.89]She called up and came to me
[01:40.65]Covered in rain
[01:43.88]And dinnertime shadowing
[01:47.49]And as her clothes spun, we spooned
[01:52.39]And I knew I was through
[01:55.52]When I said "I love you"
[01:58.48]
[02:28.24]Friday evening, we've been drinking
[02:31.66]2 AM, I swear I might propose
[02:41.70]But we close the tab
[02:43.82]Split a cab
[02:45.82]Call each other up when we get home
[02:51.17]Falling asleep to the sound
[02:56.08]Of sirens
[02:58.44]
[03:05.53]I've got a city love
[03:12.17]I found it in Lydia
[03:15.78]
[03:19.86]From the battery
[03:23.35]To the gallery
[03:26.97]It's the kind of thing you only see
[03:31.50]In scented, glossy magazines
[03:36.54]
[03:41.47]And I can't remember life before her name
