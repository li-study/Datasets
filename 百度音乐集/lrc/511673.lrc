
[00:15.05]Summer stretching on the grass... summer dresses pass
[00:21.57]In the shade of a willow tree creeps a crawling over me
[00:28.63]Over me and over you stuck together with God's glue
[00:31.71]It's going to get stickier too...
[00:35.20]It's been a long hot summer
[00:41.88]let's go undercover
[00:45.34]Don't try too hard to think... don't think at all
[00:50.64]I'm not the only one starin' at the sun
[00:57.40]Afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside
[01:04.28]Not just deaf and dumb i'm staring at the sun
[01:11.03]Not the only one who's happy to go blind
[01:26.89]There's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear
[01:33.43]It's gonna itch and burn and sting
[01:36.88]Do you want to see what the scratching brings
[01:40.22]Waves that leave me out of reach
[01:43.65]Breaking on your back like a beach...
[01:47.07]Will we ever live in peace?
[01:50.40]Cause those that can't do often have to
[01:57.12]Those that can't do often have to... preach
[02:04.08]To the ones staring at the sun...
[02:09.17]Afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside
[02:16.14]Not just deaf and dumb... staring at the sun
[02:22.69]I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind
[02:45.38]Intransigence is all around... military is still in town
[02:52.18]Armour plated suits and ties... daddy just won't say goodbye
[02:59.00]Referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will HE listen
[03:05.80]I'm nearly great
[03:09.21]But there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free
[03:21.39]Though you never really belonged to me
[03:24.54]You're not the only one staring at the sun
[03:27.98]Afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside
[03:34.68]I'm not sucking my thumb I'm staring at the sun
[03:41.93]Not the only one who's happy to go blind
