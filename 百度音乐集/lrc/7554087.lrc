[00:22.70]
[00:22.80]Oh Danny boy
[00:26.50]The pipes the pipes are calling
[00:31.96]From glenn to glenn
[00:35.83]And down the mountain side
[00:41.21]The summer's gone
[00:45.20]And all the flowers are dying
[00:50.28]'Tis you, 'tis you must go
[00:56.45]And I must bye
[01:00.86]But come ye back
[01:04.98]When summer's in the meadow
[01:10.17]Or when the valley's hushed
[01:15.87]And white with snow
[01:20.18]'Tis I'll be there
[01:24.21]In Sunshine or in shadow
[01:29.79]Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy
[01:34.47]I love you so
[01:38.92]
[01:42.04]And if you come
[01:45.60]when all the flowers are dying
[01:51.23]If I am dead
[01:54.99]As dead I well may be
[02:00.99]You'll come and find
[02:04.90]The place where I am lying
[02:10.51]And kneel and say an Ave
[02:15.92]For me
[02:20.10]And I shall hear
[02:24.00]The soft you tread above me
[02:29.74]And all my grave
[02:33.61]shall warm and sweeter be
[02:39.26]If you will bend
[02:43.28]And tell me
[02:44.80]That you love me
[02:48.99]and I shall sleep in peace
[02:52.67]Until you come to me
[02:59.11]and I shall sleep in peace
[03:04.00]Until you come to me
[03:12.03]
