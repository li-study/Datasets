[00:00.00]Finger Eleven - One Thing
[00:23.37]
[00:25.37]Restless tonight
[00:28.20]Cause I wasted the light
[00:31.59]Between both these times
[00:34.43]I drew a really thin line
[00:37.95]It's nothing I planned
[00:41.10]And not that I can
[00:44.15]But you should be mine
[00:47.38]Across that line
[00:49.61]
[00:50.26]If I traded it all
[00:53.31]If I gave it all away for one thing
[00:59.14]Just for one thing
[01:02.75]If I sorted it out
[01:05.93]If I knew all about this one thing
[01:11.53]Wouldn't that be something
[01:14.19]
[01:15.77]I promise I might
[01:18.86]Not walk on by
[01:21.95]Maybe next time
[01:25.01]But not this time
[01:27.16]
[01:28.79]Even though I know
[01:31.86]I don't want to know
[01:34.95]Yeah I guess I know
[01:37.22]I just hate how it sounds
[02:05.61][01:40.37]If I traded it all
[02:08.72][01:43.58]If I gave it all away for one thing
[02:14.48][01:49.35]Just for one thing
[02:18.16][01:53.07]If I sorted it out
[02:21.30][01:56.15]If I knew all about this one thing
[02:26.91][02:01.75]Wouldn't that be something
[02:29.99][02:04.32]
[02:43.93][02:31.72]Even though I know
[02:47.40][02:34.70]I don't want to know
[02:50.42][02:37.85]Yeah I guess I know
[02:52.74][02:40.09]I just hate how it sounds
[02:55.86]
[04:13.10][03:48.05][03:22.69][02:57.56]If I traded it all
[04:16.43][03:50.97][03:25.74][03:00.69]If I gave it all away for one thing
[04:21.84][03:56.81][03:31.58][03:06.41]Just for one thing
[04:00.44][03:35.27][03:10.11]If I sorted it out
[04:03.48][03:38.33][03:13.20]If I knew all about this one thing
[04:09.18][03:44.00][03:18.87]Wouldn't that be something
[04:24.84][04:12.08][03:46.91][03:21.28]
