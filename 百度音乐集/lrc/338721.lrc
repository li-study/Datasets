[00:15.06]Last night
[00:16.06]I got served a little too much of that poison baby
[00:21.16]Last night
[00:22.16]I did things I'm not proud of
[00:25.14]And I got a little crazy
[00:27.14]Last night
[00:28.14]I met a guy on the dance floor
[00:31.13]and I let him call me baby
[00:35.72]And I don't even know his last name
[00:41.70]My momma would be so ashamed
[00:47.99]It started of, hey cutie where you from
[00:50.78]And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
[00:53.78]And I don't even know his last name
[01:03.15]We left, the club, 'bout around 3 o'clock in the morning
[01:08.94]His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
[01:13.23]well it should have been a warning
[01:15.23]I had no clue what I was getting into
[01:19.23]So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
[01:26.70]And I don't even know his last name
[01:32.70]My momma would be so ashamed
[01:38.97]It started of, hey cutie where you from
[01:41.67]And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
[01:44.56]And I don't even know his last name
[01:50.56]Here we go
[01:52.16]
[02:06.15]Today, I woke up
[02:08.14]thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
[02:11.33]I'm not sure how I got here
[02:14.23]Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
[02:19.12]I gotta go take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
[02:23.71]They say what happens here, stays here
[02:25.50]all of this will disappear
[02:28.58]There's just one little problem
[02:31.28]I don't even know my last night
[02:37.16]My momma would be so ashamed
[02:43.55]It started of, hey cutie where you from
[02:46.14]And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
[02:49.24]And I don't even know my last name
[02:55.62]What have I done
[02:57.12]What have I done

[03:02.61]I don't even know my last name
[03:10.29]Well it turned into, oh no what have I done
[03:12.98]And I don't even know my last name
[03:18.37]Yea, Yeah, Yeah
[03:43.62]It started off hey cutie where you from
[03:46.01]And then it turned into, oh no what have I done
[03:49.10]And I don't even know my last name
[03:56.09]Oh, yeah
