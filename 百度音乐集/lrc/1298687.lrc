[00:04.77]Voice Inside My Head
[00:08.91]Dixie Chicks
[00:11.83]Taking The Long Way
[00:17.16]I was only a kid
[00:21.82]When I said goodbye to you
[00:26.16]Ten summers ago
[00:29.28]But it feels like yesterday
[00:34.74]Lost, scared and alone
[00:38.04]Nothing I could give to you
[00:44.47]I tried, I really did
[00:46.41]But I couldn't find another way
[00:51.16]And I want and I need
[00:56.17]Somehow to believe
[01:00.25]In the choice I made
[01:04.25]Am I better off this way
[01:09.12]I can hear the voice inside my head
[01:18.00]Saying you should be with me instead
[01:26.39]Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
[01:35.01]What would it be like with you around
[02:00.62]So I, I made my way
[02:04.05]Cold and roaming in the wild
[02:09.26]I'm forever changed
[02:12.25]By someone I never knew
[02:17.77]Now I've, I've got a place
[02:21.56]I've got a husband and a child
[02:26.19]But I'll never forget
[02:29.44]What I've given up in you
[02:33.92]And I want, I need
[02:39.06]Somehow to believe
[02:42.80]In the choice I made
[02:47.20]Am I better off this way
[02:51.97]I can hear the voice inside my head
[03:00.59]Saying you should be with me instead
[03:09.23]Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
[03:17.83]What would it be like with you around
[03:58.85]And I want, I need
[04:03.82]Somehow to believe
[04:07.61]In the choice I made
[04:11.92]Am I better off this way
