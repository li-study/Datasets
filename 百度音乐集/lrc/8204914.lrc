[00:08.50]Ronan Keating
[00:10.50]
[00:11.50]And I'd give up forever to touch you
[00:15.50]Cause I know that you feel me somehow
[00:20.50]You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
[00:25.50]And I don't want to go home right now
[00:29.50]
[00:30.50]And all I can taste is this moment
[00:35.50]And all I can breathe is your life
[00:39.50]Cause sooner or later it's over
[00:44.50]I just don't want to miss you tonight
[00:48.50]And I don't want the world to see me
[00:53.50]Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[00:58.50]When everything's made to be broken
[01:02.50]I just want you to know who I am
[01:07.50]
[01:19.50]And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
[01:24.50]Or the moment of truth in your lies
[01:29.50]When everything seems like the movies
[01:33.50]Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
[01:38.50]And I don't want the world to see me
[01:43.50]Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[01:48.50]When everything's made to be broken
[01:52.50]I just want you to know who I am
[02:37.63]And I don't want the world to see me
[02:43.29]Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[02:48.60]When everything's made to be broken
[02:52.99]I just want you to know who I am
[03:00.51]And I don't want the world to see me
[03:04.35]Cause I don't think that they'd understand
[03:09.62]When everything's made to be broken
[03:13.51]I just want you to know who I am
[03:17.92]I just want you to know who I am
[03:23.38]I just want you to know who I am
