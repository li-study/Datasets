[00:19.72]When I see your smile
[00:26.28]Tears run down my face I can't replace
[00:36.71]And now that I'm strong I have figured out
[00:40.39]How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul
[00:45.00]And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one
[00:54.47]I will never let you fall
[00:58.53]I'll stand up with you forever
[01:02.45]I'll be there for you through it all
[01:06.72]Even if saving you sends me to heaven
[01:14.70]It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[01:27.64]Seasons are changing and waves are crashing
[01:31.82]And stars are falling all for us
[01:36.14]Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
[01:40.31]I can show you I'll be the one
[01:45.55]I will never let you fall (let you fall)
[01:49.76]I'll stand up with you forever
[01:53.85]I'll be there for you through it all (through it all)
[01:58.07]Even if saving you sends me to heaven
[02:02.40]Cuz you're my, you're my, my, my true love, my whole heart
[02:16.02]Please don't throw that away
[02:16.55]Cuz I'm here for you
[02:27.60]Please don't walk away and
[02:31.87]Please tell me you'll stay stay
[02:53.24]Use me as you will
[02:56.77]Pull my strings just for a thrill
[03:01.20]And I know I'll be okay
[03:05.34]Though my skies are turning gray
[03:09.21]I will never let you fall
[03:15.02]I'll stand up with you forever
[03:18.81]I'll be there for you through it all
[03:22.85]Even if saving you sends me to heaven
[03:27.84]I will never let you fall
[03:32.00]I'll stand up with you forever
[03:36.11]I'll be there for you through it all
[03:40.23]Even if saving you sends me to heaven....
