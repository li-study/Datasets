[00:07]I Can Wait Forever
[00:11]
[00:16]When you say I miss the things you do,
[00:22]I just wanna get back close again to you.
[00:28]But for now your voice is near enough.
[00:35]How I miss you, and I miss you love.
[00:40]And though all the days that pass me by so slow,
[00:49]All the emptiness inside me flows all around,
[00:56]And there's no way out.
[00:59]I'm just thinkin' so much of you.
[01:02]There was never any doubt.
[03:25][02:33][01:05]
[04:19][04:12][03:53][03:28][02:34][01:07]I can wait forever
[04:00][03:35][02:40][01:12]If you say you'll be there too.
[04:06][03:40][02:46][01:19]I can wait forever if you will.
[03:46][02:52][01:24]I know it's worth it all
[02:55][01:27]To spend my life alone with you.
[02:59][01:33]
[01:43]When it looked as though my life was wrong,
[01:49]You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong.
[01:55]I'll be here when hope is out of sight.
[02:02]I just wish that I was next to you tonight.
[02:07]And oh, I'll be reaching for you even though
[02:16]You'll be somewhere else, my love.
[02:19]We'll go like a bird on its way back home.
[02:26]I could never let you go.
[02:29]And I just want you to know...
[03:01]Where are you now,
[03:04]along with the thoughts we share?
[03:11]Keep them strong somehow.
[03:17]And you know I'll always be there.
