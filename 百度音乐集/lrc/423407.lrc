[00:07.13]yo
[00:08.44]watch as the room rocks
[00:09.66]mentally moonwalk
[00:10.86]mixed media slang banging in your boombox
[00:13.08]verbal violence
[00:14.37]lyrical stylist
[00:15.60]in a time when rock/hip-hop rhymes are childish
[00:17.65]you can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
[00:19.78]rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an emcee
[00:22.25]with your lack of skill and facility you're killing me
[00:24.58]and a DJ in the group just for credibility
[00:27.45]i heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
[00:29.53]you're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
[00:31.94]rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
[00:34.23]cuz rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
[00:36.51]but now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
[00:39.03]all after a fast buck
[00:40.55]and all the tracks suck
[00:41.78]so how does it stack up?
[00:42.81]none of its real
[00:43.95]you wanna be an emcee?
[00:44.95]you gotta study the skill

[00:50.85]who can rock a rhyme like this
[00:53.55]step, step up, step, step up
[00:55.93]so you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
[00:57.68]but mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
[01:00.81]with a tendency to make up stories
[01:02.94]it sounded like the only hip-hop you've heard is top-40
[01:05.78]and your record company's completely missed it
[01:08.33]and all the kids are dissin' it for not being legitimate
[01:10.64]so in a battle, you can't hack it
[01:12.53]react with whack shit, and get smacked with verbal backflips
[01:15.33]get your ass kicked, i'm a fabulous battle catalyst
[01:17.49]it's taken decades for emcees to establish this
[01:19.97]you're new to hip-hop and welcome if you're serious
[01:22.37]but not on a mike, leave that to the experienced
[01:25.17](using waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponent
[01:30.90]leaving him vulnerable to attack)

[02:35.79]sound scientists
[02:37.58]we here at the sound institute have invented a reliable
[02:40.47]audio weapon system
[02:42.22]actual movement of musical sound in space is used to
[02:45.23]carefully attack
[02:46.59]and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
