[00:02.50]This Is How We Do It
[00:05.50]Montell Jordan
[00:08.50]
[00:12.62]This is how we do it
[00:15.22]
[00:17.36]This is how we do it
[00:18.91]La la la la la la la
[00:23.60]La la lo lo lo lo oh
[00:25.50]
[00:26.55]This is how we do it
[00:28.43]La la la la oh
[00:33.50]This is how we do it, it's Friday night
[00:37.50]And I feel all right
[00:40.20]The party's here on the West side
[00:42.50]So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
[00:44.96]Designated driver take the keys to my truck
[00:47.42]Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
[00:49.57]Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
[00:52.05]It feels so good in my hood tonight
[00:56.40]The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
[00:58.90]All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
[01:01.63]You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
[01:05.42]So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
[01:08.04]And let me hear the party say
[01:10.12]I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
[01:14.62]South Central does it like nobody does
[01:19.39]To all my neighbours you got much flava
[01:24.00]Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
[01:28.63]This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
[01:33.06]And wave them from here to there
[01:35.51]If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
[01:38.25]You see the hood's been good to me
[01:40.42]Ever since I was a lower-case G
[01:42.77]But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
[01:45.72]Hundred dollar bills y'all
[01:47.47]If you were from where I'm from then you would know
[01:51.57]That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
[01:54.32]You can get yours in a '64
[01:57.33]Whatever it is, the party's underway
[02:00.99]So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
[02:03.79]And let me hear the party say
[02:05.84]I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
[02:10.06]Ooh South Central does it like nobody does
[02:14.91]To all my neighbours you got much flava
[02:19.43]Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
[02:24.12]I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
[02:28.73]South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
[02:33.50]YNV, SCC,
[02:38.17]I'll never come wack on an old school track
[02:42.23]Check it out!
[02:43.16]Once upon a time in '94
[02:45.10]Montell made no money and life sure was slow
[02:47.55]All they said was 6'8" he stood
[02:49.92]And people thought the music that he made was good
[02:52.17]There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
[02:54.46]He came up to Monty, this is what he said
[02:56.80]You and OG are gonna make some cash
[02:59.20]Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash
[03:01.76]Oh I'm buzzing because
[03:05.88]South Central does it like nobody does
[03:10.52]To all my neighbours you got much flava
[03:15.05]I'll never come wack on an old school track
[03:19.73]I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
[03:24.36]South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
[03:29.68]Oh it's party time
[03:33.59]Straight up comin' from the West side
[03:38.34]OG's got the flava, yeah
[03:42.97]And Monty doesn't like nobody, doesn't
[03:47.73]Come on now, Def Jam, you know what it
