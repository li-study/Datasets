[00:20.25]
[00:35.48]I feel so extraordinary
[00:39.07]Something's got a hold on me
[00:43.15]I get this feeling I'm in motion
[00:47.10]A sudden sense of liberty
[00:51.27]I don't care 'cause I'm not there
[00:55.30]And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
[00:59.48]Again and again I've taken too much
[01:03.54]Of the things that cost you too much
[01:08.02]
[01:08.34]I used to think that the day would never come
[01:12.00]I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
[01:16.08]My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
[01:20.13]To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
[01:24.26]I used to think that the day would never come
[01:28.31]That my life would depend on the morning sun
[01:32.55]
[01:36.43]When I was a very small boy
[01:40.21]Very small boys talked to me
[01:44.26]Now that we've grown up together
[01:48.38]They're afraid of what they see
[01:52.40]That's the price that we all pay
[01:56.42]Our valued destiny comes to nothing
[02:00.66]I can't tell you where we're going
[02:04.58]I guess there was just no way of knowing
[02:09.11]
[02:09.45]I used to think that the day would never come
[02:13.09]I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
[02:17.24]My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
[02:21.30]To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
[02:25.45]I used to think that the day would never come
[02:29.47]That my life would depend on the morning sun
[02:34.19]
[03:22.29]I feel so extraordinary
[03:26.18]Something's got a hold on me
[03:30.23]I get this feeling I'm in motion
[03:34.25]A sudden sense of liberty
[03:38.32]The chances are we've gone too far
[03:42.34]You took my time and you took my money
[03:46.51]Now I fear you've left me standing
[03:50.56]In a world that's so demanding
[03:55.18]I used to think that the day would never come
[03:59.16]I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
[04:03.24]My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
[04:07.25]To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
[04:11.16]
[04:11.62]I used to think that the day would never come
[04:15.39]That my life would depend on the morning sun
[04:19.83]
[04:21.87]I used to think that the day would never come
[04:25.67]I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
[04:29.73]My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
[04:33.82]To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
[04:38.12]I used to think that the day would never come
[04:41.97]That my life would depend on the morning sun
