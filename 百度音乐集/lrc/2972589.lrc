[00:26.05]you show up like a hurricane,
[00:28.17]all hungry-eyed and weather-stained
[00:30.32]the clock forgets to tick and i the same
[00:34.18]I died the day you disappeared,
[00:36.72]so why would you be welcome here?
[00:38.84]Ride the wind that brought you back away
[00:43.08]
[00:44.42]no you can't come in
[00:51.73]
[00:52.67]no you can't come in
[00:57.68]
[01:07.84]i cannot stop my rebel hands
[01:09.65]from pulling out the pots and pans
[01:12.11]i left you in the cold until you shook
[01:16.06]you're gentle now, but i recall
[01:18.55]both tender fire and bitter squall
[01:20.62]a history so deep it hurts to look
[01:24.61]
[01:28.10]no you can't come in
[01:33.92]

[01:59.79]and the wind will be wailing
[02:04.09]But I will be sailing faster
[02:08.25]Oh the elements I do not fear
[02:12.42]but I fall apart when you appear
[02:16.78]Cos you are the greatest
[02:20.87]The greatest disaster
[02:24.93]
[02:58.50]if the sea should swallow up my house
[03:02.81]I will turn my rooftop inside out
[03:06.72]and the wind will be wailing
[03:11.17]But I will be sailing faster
