[00:02.00]Sevendust - Nowhere
[00:07.00]
[00:22.66]Is this the life you made
[00:25.86]The kind of life you fake
[00:28.05]Is there a point we break?
[00:30.27]Or do we sing that same old song
[00:35.54]And hope they play along (We follow)
[02:59.75][02:40.58][01:37.13][00:45.59]We're well on our way now to nowhere
[03:06.72][01:43.29][00:52.82](To nowhere)
[03:08.65][02:49.91][01:45.47][00:54.89]We're so far away from getting somewhere
[02:56.16][01:00.99](From where getting somewhere)
[01:09.09]Please stop the broken record
[01:12.57]Your worthless effort
[01:14.80]That makes you feel like God
[01:17.87]So play that song
[01:21.57]And watch it all go wrong
[01:27.38](Where do we search to find the honesty
[01:29.80]In a world so fucked up and bleeding)
[01:33.77]Knowing we will follow
[03:15.00][01:51.84]Close to anything at all
[02:47.61](On our way)
