[00:13.36]
[00:21.52]All the stars are out tonight it feels as though I might
[00:27.67]Make some sense out of this madness will it turn out right
[01:54.79][00:52.70][00:33.81]Who's to say where the wind will blow
[00:40.14]Time will tell us if we're out of answers when it stops
[00:46.02]Climb back down to the beginning
[00:49.49]Take it from the top
[03:00.72][00:58.86]What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground
[02:01.08]What happens when everything is lying on the ground
[03:06.76][02:06.98][01:04.97]Do you pick up the pieces all around
[03:12.75][02:13.21][01:10.93]and if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
[03:25.53][03:19.30][02:19.73][01:17.45]Take your chances turn around and go
[03:30.93][01:23.63]
[01:42.39]All the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray
[01:48.52]Strange our life coincides with the seasons of today
[02:28.23]Carry on you say
[02:31.04]Bring the best of today
[02:34.44]All I see is struggling on the way
[02:43.63]Maybe when the sun crashes through the gray
[02:49.76]I can find the strength to make it through the day
[02:56.75]Through the day
