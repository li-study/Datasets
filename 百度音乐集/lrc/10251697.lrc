[00:18.11]Nobody really knows
[00:22.18]Where they're supposed to go
[00:26.68]Hiding behind a wall
[00:30.40]Afraid that they'll lose it all
[00:35.13]But it's alright
[00:37.53]Just follow the light

[00:48.18]And always be here in my heart

[02:29.07]And don't be afraid of the dark
[02:33.01]In the moonlight
[02:35.56]You'll dance till you fall
