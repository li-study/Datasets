[00:00.00]Tori Amos - Ireland
[00:09.32]
[02:58.01][02:03.19][01:08.30][00:13.32]Drivin' in my Saab
[03:00.99][02:06.17][01:11.37][00:16.48]On my way to Ireland
[03:05.58][02:10.68][01:15.78][00:20.93]It's been a long time
[01:18.95][00:24.10]It's been a long time
[03:09.06][02:13.88]a long time
[03:12.27][02:17.42][01:22.61][00:27.71]Drivin' with my friends
[03:15.25][02:20.53][01:25.84][00:30.93]On my way to Ireland
[03:20.22][02:25.18][01:30.34][00:35.41]It's been a long time
[01:33.45][00:38.60]It's been a long time
[03:23.81][02:28.78]a long time
[03:28.83][02:31.48][01:36.35][00:41.56]
[00:42.23]So when I was out
[00:46.55]In the desert
[00:49.15]And a cowboy
[00:51.92]Tried to lasso me
[00:55.21]He said your red
[00:57.44]And made of clay
[00:59.11]A virgin portrait
[01:01.83]I let him wake me
[01:04.01]But decided not to stay
[01:07.74]
[01:37.34]Next in New York
[01:39.82]I fell out with a dragon
[01:43.63]Of the white collar kind
[01:46.49]But just as ferocious
[01:50.07]I remembered Macha
[01:52.55]Running faster than the horses
[01:56.49]Then an encounter with
[01:59.40]A voice that caressed me
[02:02.73]
[02:32.16]Wasn't it you who
[02:35.08]Held off a surrender
[02:38.44]To one spoiled nun
[02:41.47]Who taught you the names
[02:44.96]Of the mountains
[02:47.34]On the moon
[02:48.89]And then a Jesuit
[02:51.23]Proceded to arrange your soul
[02:54.41]While I prayed
[02:55.68]On my knees
[02:57.51]
[03:29.24]a such long long time
[03:33.22]a long time, a long time
[03:44.33]
