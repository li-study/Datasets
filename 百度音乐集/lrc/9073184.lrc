[00:31.96]Yesterday I lost my closest friend
[00:38.27]Yesterday I wanted time to end
[00:44.46]I wonder if my heart will ever mend
[00:50.58]I just let you slip away
[00:56.83]4 AM forever
[01:02.78]Maybe I'll never see you smile again
[01:08.88]Maybe you thought that it was all pretend;
[01:15.17]All these words that I could never say
[01:21.72]I just let them slip away
[01:27.62]4 AM forever
[01:33.89]Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)
[01:39.98]Why don't you listen when I try to make it through (to you)
[01:46.60]Goodbye, goodbye
[01:50.43]Goodbye, you never know
[01:52.75]Hold a little tighter
[01:58.83]4 AM forever
[02:04.76]Maybe one day when I can move along
[02:11.02]Maybe someday when you can hear this song
[02:17.60]You won't let it slip away
[02:23.78]4 AM forever
[02:29.95]And I'd wish the sun would never come
[02:36.20]It's 4 AM and you are gone
[02:42.44]I hope you know you're letting go
[02:48.61]It's 4 AM and I'm alone
[03:19.42]Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)
[03:25.55]Why don't you listen when I try to make it through (to you)
[03:32.06]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:35.18]Goodbye, you never know
[03:38.22]Hold a little tighter
[03:44.08]Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)
[03:50.37]Why don't you listen when I try to make it through (to you)
[03:56.80]Goodbye, goodbye
[03:59.81]Goodbye, you never know
[04:03.00]Hold a little tighter
[04:09.24]4 AM forever...
