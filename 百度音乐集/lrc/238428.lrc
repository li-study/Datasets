[00:04.24]Bryan Adams
[00:10.05]there was this girl i used to see
[00:12.57]down on 42nd street
[00:15.01]she'd walk by on her way to work
[00:17.27]n' make the air smell so sweet
[00:19.77]i used to sit in a coffee shop
[00:22.45]sometimes i'd have a cup
[00:24.89]and when she'd go by
[00:25.84]she'd light up the sky
[00:27.29]like the sun coming up
[00:29.44]she be standin' by the bus stop
[00:31.83]driver opened up the door
[00:34.05]i'd just sit n' watch her
[00:36.20]getting on the 104
[00:38.83]i wanna give her my number
[00:40.94]i wanna tell her my name
[00:42.94]wanna climb on board that crosstown bus
[00:45.76]take a chance she feels the same
[00:48.83]it's just another east side story
[00:53.53]everybody's got a tale to tell
[00:58.11]like a hundred guys before me
[01:02.69]i fell under her spell
[01:08.51](it's just another east side story)
[01:16.95]some things you hold on to
[01:19.44]some you just let go
[01:21.99]seems like the ones that you can't have
[01:24.20]are the ones that you want most
[01:26.98]i think about her sometimes
[01:29.15]i wonder if she was real
[01:31.40]and if i ever find her i'm gonna tell her how i feel

[01:55.37](it's just another east side story)
[02:06.17](like a hundred guys before me)
[02:14.69]it's still the same old story
[02:17.33] it's still the same old game
[02:19.73]up there on the eastside
[02:22.25]life goes on the same
