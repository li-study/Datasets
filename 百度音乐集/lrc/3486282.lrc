[00:14.50]Trying to analyze every angle, situation
[00:17.14]Trying to find an explanation
[00:18.52]Cause it\'s getting aggrivating
[00:19.94]Why my relationships never seem to work out
[00:22.86]Beginnin\' to worry and doubt
[00:25.30]If I\'m even able to detect he\'s the one
[00:27.72]When to stay or when to run
[00:29.12]Why I haven\'t seen the sun
[00:30.67]Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
[00:33.21]Cause I\'m getting tired of the rain
[00:35.86]
[00:36.03]Falling on my heartbreak and I
[00:41.11]Get my hopes up when I\'m in love
[00:43.82]Until we break up then I\'m back to the
[00:46.25]Same spot, I\'ve been lonely, drowning
[00:52.02]Cause every guy turns out to be the same
[00:54.78]So now I\'m questionin\' is it me to blame
[00:56.58]
[00:56.72]Is It Me? am I so complicated?
[00:59.13]Is It Me? or is love over-rated?
[01:01.79]Is It Me? cause I don\'t quite understand
[01:04.56]Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
[01:07.25]Is It Me? am I too independent?
[01:09.30]Is It Me? not ready for commitment?
[01:12.30]Is It Me? cause it doesn\'t seem to last
[01:15.05]And it\'s the only question that I never asked
[01:17.45]
[01:17.62]Maybe I\'m longin\' for it more than I should be expecting
[01:20.16]All the standards that I\'m setting
[01:21.50]Unrealistically I\'m getting
[01:22.80]Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
[01:25.37]Because I\'m so confused and insecure
[01:28.24]Cause when i know for certain everything is going wrong
[01:30.59]I permitted to prolong
[01:31.87]Tried my best to hold on
[01:33.53]My Mister Right\'s probably hanging round my window pane
[01:36.36]While I look through only watching the rain
[01:38.66]
[01:39.00]Falling on my heartbreak and I
[01:44.09]Get my hopes up when I\'m in love
[01:46.85]Until we break up then I\'m back to the
[01:49.44]Same spot, I\'ve been lonely, drowning
[01:54.63]Cause every guy turns out to be the same
[01:57.25]So now I\'m questionin\' is it me to blame

[02:15.21]Is It Me? cause it doesn\'t seem to last
[02:18.03]And it\'s the only question that I never asked
[02:20.65]
[02:20.81]Never thought it could be that its me
[02:23.45]Till i realized I`m the only
[02:26.12]Common factor and played a big part
[02:28.71]In letting people break my heart
[02:31.36]Never noticin\' I was wasting time
[02:33.83]Asking the same thing every time
[02:36.50]Who were you with? and where were you at?
[02:38.35]Until I took the time to turn and look back
[02:44.75]
[02:48.04]Ooooh la la la
[02:52.62]La la la la
[02:55.49]La la la
