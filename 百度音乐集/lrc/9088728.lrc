[00:15.00]
[00:24.87]Diamond life, lover boy
[00:32.68]He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
[00:40.82]City lights and business nights
[00:48.69]When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
[00:56.23]
[00:57.97]No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
[01:06.12]When sentiment is left to chance
[01:13.30]No place to be ending but somewhere to start
[01:19.35]No need to ask
[01:20.92]He's a smooth operator
[01:24.91]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[01:32.83]Smooth operator
[01:37.19]Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
[01:44.94]Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
[01:51.14]
[01:54.14](Music----)
[02:22.14]
[02:25.63]Face to face, each classic case
[02:33.28]We shadow box and double cross
[02:37.14]Yet need the chase
[02:40.98]
[02:42.22]A license to love, insurance to hold
[02:50.32]Melts all your memories and change into gold
[02:58.35]His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
[03:03.68]No need to ask
[03:05.19]He's a smooth operator
[03:09.25]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[03:17.32]Smooth operator
[03:21.59]Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
[03:29.32]Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
[03:35.89]
[03:37.38]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[03:45.50]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[03:53.35]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[04:01.34]Smooth operator, smooth operator
[04:11.51]Smooth operator, smooth operator
