[00:18.80]Everbody's got their problems,
[00:21.50]everybody says the samething to you.
[00:24.31]It's just a matter  how you solve them,
[00:26.71]and knowing how to change the things you've been through.
[00:29.80]I feel I've come to realize,
[00:32.52]How fast life can be compromised.
[00:35.50]Step back to see what's going on,
[00:38.20]I can't believe this happened to you.

[00:51.75]It's just a problem that we're faced with, am I
[00:54.55]not the only one who hates to stand by.
[00:57.46]Complications ended first in this line
[01:00.26]with all these pictures running through my mind.
[01:03.20]Knowing endless consequences,

[01:24.00]Part of me won't agree cause I don't know if it's for sure.
[01:29.50]Suddenly, suddenly I don't feel so insecure anymore.

[02:11.82]It's just a matter  how you solve them,
[02:14.83]What is always suppose to do?
[02:19.73]Part of me won't agree cause I don't know if it's for sure.
[02:24.85]Suddenly, suddenly I dont feel so insecure.
[02:30.54]Part of me won't agree cause I don't know if it's for sure.

[02:42.70]Why do things that matter the most
[02:45.56]Never end up being what we chose
[02:48.56]Now that I find no way so bad
[02:50.85]I don't think I knew what I had
[02:53.75]Why do things that matter the most
