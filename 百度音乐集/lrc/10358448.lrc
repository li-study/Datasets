[00:09.87]Calls will be measured lest in between
[00:15.05]You said to heather
[00:17.69]That you will scream out the manager's name
[00:22.36]He called you insane
[00:24.15]And you showed you were inclined
[00:28.65]To say you'll resign
[00:33.56]To say you'll resign
[00:37.58]
[00:39.89]Calls will be measured lest you resign
[00:45.06]Leave a feather when you remind them
[00:49.83]Until they erase your guaranteed days
[00:54.47]And you show you were inclined
[00:59.19]To say you'll resign
[01:04.16]To say you'll resign
[01:09.15]To say you'll resign
[01:11.72]When counting the plans
[01:14.77]And you see my opened resign
[01:19.59]And you think wonder you too you shout and resign
[01:27.96]
[01:30.42]Stretch out the pleasure as far as you can
[01:35.35]Ask him if heather can understand
[01:39.55]That the pills and the planes hardly insane
[01:44.91]And you show you were inclined
[01:49.45]To say you'll resign
[01:54.44]To say you'll resign
[01:59.38]To say you'll resign
[02:04.09]To say you'll resign
