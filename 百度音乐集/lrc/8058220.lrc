[00:03.68]Album: Hilary Duff
[00:06.80][00:13.49][03:06.74][03:32.27]
[00:15.67][02:24.56]Here I am again
[00:17.17][02:25.78]Talking to myself
[00:18.47][02:27.15]Sitting at a red light
[00:23.33][02:31.91]Both hands on the wheel
[00:24.77][02:33.36]How am I supposed to feel?
[00:25.99][02:34.73]So much running through my mind
[00:31.01]First you wanna be free
[00:32.81]Now you say you need me
[00:34.55]Giving mixed signals in size
[00:37.79][01:34.61]It's so hard to let you in
[00:41.32][01:37.99]Thinking you might slam the brakes again
[00:46.16][01:42.81][02:39.69]Push the pedal down
[00:47.32][01:44.08][02:40.88]Heading out of town
[00:48.76][01:45.50]Gotta make a getaway
[00:53.39][01:50.22][02:46.96]The traffic in my brain's
[00:54.97][01:51.66][02:48.42]Driving me insane
[00:56.43][01:53.18]This is more than I can take
[01:02.00][01:58.76][02:55.51]You tell me that you love me first
[01:05.71][02:02.48][02:59.22]Then throw your heart into reverse
[01:09.48][02:06.28][03:03.01]I gotta get away
[01:12.70]I can't keep coming back to you
[01:15.38]Every time you're in the mood
[01:16.90]To whisper something sweet in my ear
[01:20.31]It's so hard to move on
[01:22.18]Cause every time I think you're gone
[01:24.51]You show up in my rearview mirror
[01:27.84]Is this just a detour?
[01:29.63]Cause I gotta be sure
[01:31.40]That you really mean what you say
[02:08.69]To a place where I can be redefined
[02:12.56]Where you're out of sight
[02:14.35]And you're out of mind
[02:16.31]But the truth is I can't even say goodbye
[02:42.22]Gotta make a getaway (a getaway)
[02:49.90]This is more than I can take (I can take)
