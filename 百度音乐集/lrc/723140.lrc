[02:13.95][01:15.08][00:26.00]
[02:22.23][00:29.63]When your heart is beating black and blue
[02:30.45][00:38.30]And a cold world's looking back at you
[00:45.51]When you're fading low around the bend
[00:52.32]Go on turn around you'll see me
[00:56.24]I will always be your friend
[03:07.27][02:51.99][00:59.57]Set your heart free
[03:14.83][03:00.08][01:44.98][01:07.45]Set your heart free...
[01:15.99]Said you can't say much about today
[01:22.90]Just that dark cloud coming back your way
[01:30.51]And that your dreams are all worn thin
[01:36.77]Well, you better stop with all that talk
[01:40.74]Before it all starts happening
[01:52.51]Listen to your heart...
[02:37.94]And you're starting to become unglued
[02:45.18]Don't go there, come on, you know i love you
