[00:02.91]But can I please give her these flowers
[00:04.52]The doctor dont wanna take procedures
[00:06.75]He claimed my heart can't take the anastesia
[00:09.52]It'll send her body into a seizure

[00:22.77]They want her to live, and she trying
[00:24.94]I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in
[00:27.02]You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,
[00:29.86]If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.'s
[00:32.05]And all the broke muthafuckers past away
[00:34.17]You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.

[00:42.30]Things sposed to stop right here
[00:43.45]My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he strong,
[00:45.82]Thats where I get my confidence from
[00:48.51]I asked the nurse "did you do the research?"
[00:51.20]She ask me, "can you sign some t-shirts?"
[00:53.78]Bitch is you smokin reefer?

[01:06.88]And I can't wait for a sunny day
[01:12.86](Im seeing it through your eyes)
[01:14.65]Can't wait for the clouds to break
[01:18.33]They outside of the emergancy room, room
[01:19.90]You can feel my heart beat, beat, beat
[01:22.81]If she gone pull through

[01:37.95]Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Claire and Aunt Jean
[01:41.10]So many Aunties, we could have an Auntie team
[01:42.93]Feel like Amerie "Its this one thing"
[01:45.66]When they said that she made it
[01:47.45]You see the eyes gleam
[01:48.79]I think we at an all time high
[01:50.51]To get there we run, we fly, we drive
[01:52.84]Coz with my family we know where home is
[01:55.24]So instead of sending flowers
[01:57.16]We the roses...

[02:03.10]The roses come to see me
[02:06.70]And I can't wait for a sunny day
[02:12.05](Im seeing it through your eyes)
[02:13.91]Can't wait for the clouds to break
[02:18.03]Who brings the sunshine?

[02:32.72]The roses come to see me
[02:36.79]And I can't wait for a sunny day
