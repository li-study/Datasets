[00:27.50]Say you, say me
[00:32.50]Say it for always
[00:37.50]That's the way it should be
[00:42.50]Say you, say me
[00:48.20]Say it together, naturally
[00:57.50]I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
[01:04.44]People in the park
[01:07.71]Playing game in the dark
[01:13.09]And what they played
[01:15.28]Was a masquerade
[01:18.91]But from behind the walls of doubt
[01:23.02]A voice was crying out
[01:31.42]Say you, say me
[01:36.97]Say it for always
[01:41.21]That's the way it should be
[01:46.39]Say you, say me
[01:52.02]Say it together, naturally

[02:01.88]As we go down life's lonesome highway
[02:07.59]Seems the hardest thing to do
[02:11.68]Is to find a friend or two
[02:16.82]That helping hand
[02:18.73]Someone who understands
[02:22.53]When you feel you've lost your way
[02:26.32]You've got someone there to say
[02:29.50]I'll show you oo, oo, oo
[02:34.50]Say you, say me
[02:40.50]Say it for always
[02:44.50]That's the way it should be
[02:50.15]Say you, say me
[02:55.72]Say it together, naturally
[03:02.50]So you think you know the answers
[03:05.50]Oh no!
[03:07.50]Well the whole world's got ya dancing
[03:09.50]That's right I'm telling you
[03:12.00]It's time to start believing
[03:14.25]Oh Yes!
[03:16.44]Believe in who you are
[03:19.84]You are a shining star...oh
[03:27.17]Say you, say me
[03:32.69]Say it for always
[03:37.20]That's the way it should be
[03:41.71]Say you, say me
[03:47.27]Say it together, naturally
[03:54.51]Say it together, naturally
