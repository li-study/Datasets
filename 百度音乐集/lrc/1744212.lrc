[00:04.33]Do you remember when you were seven
[00:09.00]And the only thing that you wanted to do
[00:11.70]Was show your mum that you could play the piano
[00:14.51]Ten years have passed
[00:16.88]And the one thing that lasts
[00:19.54]Is that same old song that we played along and made my mumma cry
[00:25.49][01:30.63][02:38.61]I miss those days and I miss those ways
[00:29.81][01:35.08][02:43.06]When I got lost in fantasies
[00:32.61][01:37.88][02:45.65]In a cartoon land of mysteries
[00:35.03][01:40.44][02:48.11]In a place you won't grow old
[00:37.80]in a place you won't feel cold and I'll sing
[00:41.21][00:46.49][00:51.63][01:46.26][01:51.72][01:56.82][02:54.34][02:59.47][03:04.65][03:20.23][03:25.50][03:30.76]Da da da da da da da da da da da da
[00:43.84][01:48.99]Seems I'm lost in my reflection
[00:49.06][01:54.15][03:01.87]Find a star for my direction
[00:54.09]For the little girl inside who won't just hide
[00:59.31][02:04.52][03:38.39]Don't let me see mistakes and lies
[01:02.16][02:07.25][03:15.09][03:41.19]Let me keep my faith and innocent eyes
[01:09.19]Do you remember when you were 15
[01:14.26]And the kids at school called you a fool
[01:16.93]cos you took the chance to dream
[01:19.63]In the time that's past
[01:22.09]and the one thing that lasts
[01:24.77]Is that same old song that we played along and made my daddy cry
[01:42.85]in a place you wont feel cold
[01:59.42][03:07.16][03:33.71]For the little girl inside who wont just hide
[02:12.65]Under my feeling under my skin
[02:17.42]Under the thoughts from within
[02:22.67]Learning the subtext of the mind
[02:27.24]See creation how where defined
[02:34.32]My innocent eyes
[02:50.59]in a place you wont feel cold and I'll sing
[02:56.74]Seems I'm lost in my reflection
[03:12.37]let me see mistakes and lies
[03:22.88][03:28.09]faith and innocent eyes
[03:49.66]
