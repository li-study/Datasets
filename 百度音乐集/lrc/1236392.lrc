[00:25.03]Like a frying pan when the fire's gone
[00:27.79]Driving my pig while the band's taking pictures in the grass
[00:31.88]In my radio smashed
[00:33.43]And I like pianos in the evening sun
[00:36.06]Dragging my heels 'til my day is done
[00:38.73]Saturday night in the captain's clothes
