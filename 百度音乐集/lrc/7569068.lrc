[00:00.00]Summer Wind
[00:09.19]- Frank Sinatra
[00:19.18]
[00:21.05]The summer wind, came blowing in
[00:26.16]from across the sea
[00:31.50]It lingered there to touch your hair
[00:36.92]and walk with me
[00:42.16]All summer long we sang a song
[00:47.20]and then we strolled that golden sand
[00:54.04]Two sweethearts and the summer wind
[01:01.23]
[01:04.46]Like painted kites, those days and nights,
[01:09.26]they went flying by
[01:15.03]The world was new beneath a blue
[01:20.14]umbrella sky
[01:26.22]Then softer than a piper man
[01:31.05]one day it called to you
[01:37.99]I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind
[01:44.94]
[01:48.05]The autumn wind and the winter winds,
[01:52.97]they have come and gone
[01:58.79]And still the days, those lonely days,
[02:03.85]they go on and on
[02:09.67]And guess who sighs his lullabies
[02:15.20]through nights that never end
[02:22.34]My fickle friend, the summer wind
[02:28.97]
[02:31.84]The summer wind
[02:36.00]Warm summer wind
[02:42.30]Mmm, the summer wind
[02:45.62]
