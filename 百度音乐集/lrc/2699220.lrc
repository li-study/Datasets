[00:20]Shake down 1979, cool kids never have the time
[00:35]On a live wire right up off the street
[00:39]You and I should meet
[00:46]Junebug skipping like a stone
[00:52]Headlights pointed at the dawn
[01:01]We where sure we'd never see an end to it all
[01:07]And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
[01:17]And we don't know
[01:20]Just where our bones will rest to dust I guess
[01:28]Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
[01:46]Double cross the vacant and the bored
[01:53]They're not sure just what we have in store
[02:01]Morphine city slippin dues down to see
[02:08]That we don't even care as restless as we are
[02:17]We feel the pull in the land of the thousand guilts
[02:25]And poured cement, lamenated and assured
[02:32]To the lights and towns below
[02:38]Faster than the speed of sound
[02:46]Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope
[03:02]Justine never knew the rules
[03:09]Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
[03:17]No apolgies ever need be made
[03:23]I know you better than you fake it
[03:29]To see that we don't care to shake these zipper blues
[03:40]And we don't know
[03:44]Just where our bones will rest to dust I guess
[03:52]Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
[04:02]The street heats the urgency of sound
[04:10]As you can see there's no one around
