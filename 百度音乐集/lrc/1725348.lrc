[00:05.74]Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
[00:09.71]Salve salve regina
[00:13.12]
[00:14.62]Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva

[00:27.93]
[00:31.29]Oh what a circus, oh what a show
[00:35.64]Argentina has gone to town
[00:38.74]Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
[00:44.20]We've all gone crazy
[00:47.52]Mourning all day and mourning all night
[00:50.98]Falling over ourselves to get all
[00:54.41]of the misery right
[00:57.36]
[00:59.45]Oh what an exit, that's how to go
[01:03.83]When they're ringing your curtain down
[01:08.05]Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
[01:12.71]It's quite a sunset
[01:15.61]And good for the country in a roundabout way
[01:19.64]We've made the front page of all
[01:23.62]the world's papers today
[01:26.90]But who is this Santa Evita?
[01:30.68]Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
[01:33.98]What kind of goddess has lived among us?
[01:37.63]How will we ever get by without her?
[01:41.96]
[01:44.22]Salve regina mater misericordiae
[01:49.57]Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
[01:53.36]Salve salve regina
[01:56.63]
[01:58.16]Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva
[02:04.58]Ad te suspiramus gementes
[02:08.35]et flentes o clemens o pia
[02:11.68]
[02:13.00]She had her moments, she had some style
[02:17.83]The best show in town was the crowd
[02:21.10]Outside the Casa Rosada crying, "Eva Peron"
[02:27.28]But that's all gone now
[02:29.03]As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
[02:32.80]We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years
[02:40.55]You let down your people Evita
[02:43.63]You were supposed to have been immortal
[02:47.46]That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
[02:51.19]But in the end you could not deliver
[02:56.59]
[02:57.56]Salve regina mater misericordiae
[03:03.01]Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
[03:06.92]Salve salve regina
[03:11.20]
[03:11.70]Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva
[03:18.12]Ad te suspiramus gementes
[03:21.78]et flentes o clemens o pia
[03:25.12]
[03:25.68]Salve regina mater misericordiae
[03:31.23]Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
[03:35.09]Salve salve regina
[03:37.81]
[03:39.91]Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva
[03:46.26]Ad te suspiramus gementes
