[00:12.61]
[00:24.37]something has to change
[00:30.73]something has to give
[00:36.72]I could re-arrange
[00:42.23]my mind and what I did
[00:48.54]if I were to choose
[00:54.06]either way I loose
[01:00.46]I could be alone
[01:06.09]or be alone with you
[01:10.68]
[01:12.41]empty space

[03:36.85]you make me tired
[03:41.10]life wants to live you just want to watch it
[03:48.32]
[03:54.83]you make me tired
[04:05.89]you make me tired
