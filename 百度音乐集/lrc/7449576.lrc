[00:15.78]On a bridge across the Severn on a saturday night,
[00:20.01]Susie meets the man of her dreams.
[00:24.00]He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
[00:28.41]He doesn't want the company
[00:31.40]But there's something in the air
[00:33.41]They share a look in silence and everything is understood
[00:39.76]Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand as the rain puts a tear in his eye.
[00:46.48]
[00:47.22]SHE SAYS:

[01:23.66]But the world has got him down on his knees
[01:26.69]
[01:27.29]So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire,
[01:31.48]And suddenly he starts to believe
[01:35.55]He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why,
[01:39.30]But he thinks that he begins to see
