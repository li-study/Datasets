[ti:wind of change]
[ar:scorpions]

[00:21.50]I follow the Moskva
[00:24.50]Down to Gorky Park
[00:27.50]Listening to the wind of change
[00:35.50]An August summer night
[00:38.50]Soldiers passing by
[00:41.50]Listening to the wind of change
[01:10.50]The world is closing in
[01:13.50]Did you ever think
[01:16.50]That we could be so close, like brothers
[01:24.50]The future's in the air
[01:27.50]I can feel it everywhere
[01:30.50]Blowing with the wind of change
[01:38.50]Take me to the magic of the moment
[01:44.50]On a glory night
[01:47.50]Where the children of tomorrow dream away
[01:53.50]in the wind of change
[02:05.50]Walking down the street
[02:08.50]Distant memories
[02:12.50]Are buried in the past forever
[02:19.50]I follow the Moskva
[02:22.50]Down to Gorky Park
[02:26.50]Listening to the wind of change
[04:02.50][02:33.50]Take me to the magic of the moment
[04:08.50][02:39.50]On a glory night
[04:11.50][02:43.50]Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
[04:17.50][02:48.50]With you and me
[04:21.50][02:53.50]Take me to the magic of the moment
[04:27.50][02:58.50]On a glory night
[04:30.50][03:02.50]Where the children of tomorrow dream away
[04:35.50][03:07.50]in the wind of change
[03:13.50]The wind of change
[03:15.50]Blows straight into the face of time
[03:19.50]Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
[03:23.50]For peace of mind
[03:25.50]Let your balalaika sing
[03:28.50]What my guitar wants to say
