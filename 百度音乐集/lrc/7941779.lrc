[00:01.55]I'm looking at my watch
[00:06.68]At all the time that's been stolen
[00:12.11]When I was carrying you
[00:17.54]It seemed I've tripped and I've fallen
[00:22.97]Don't want no one to ache
[00:27.50]Oh to be in drunk and forgetful
[00:33.72]To get out of this unscathed
[00:38.27]Oh be free and inhuman
[00:43.70]Some may say
[00:48.41]I'd love to play
[00:53.47]When the chances there to take
[01:03.77]I'm mopping up the floor
[01:08.88]From messy recipes of romance
[01:14.43]I'm packing up the pots
[01:19.67]Too many cooks in the kitchen
[01:24.29]Some may say
[01:29.06]I'd love to let
[01:34.40]A good thing go to waste
[01:40.98]I let it go to waste
[01:46.00]
[02:04.86]Let a good thing go to waste a good thing go to waste
[02:15.74]Let a good thing go to waste a good thing go to waste
[02:46.25]I'm looking at my watch
[02:51.30]At all the time that's been stolen
[02:56.67]When i was carrying you
[03:02.16]It seemed I've drifted and I've fallen
