[00:03.06]Trembling starry eyed
[00:10.83]As you put your hand in mine...
[00:19.46]It was twilight
[00:22.40]On the Fourth of July
[00:25.95]Sparkling colors were
[00:29.41]Strewn across the sky
[00:32.29]And we sat close enough
[00:35.33]That we just barely touched
[00:38.77]While roman candles
[00:41.69]Went soaring above us and baby
[00:45.53]Then you put your hand in mine
[00:50.39]And we wandered away
[00:58.41]I was trembling inside
[01:03.29]But I wanted to stay
[01:11.33]Pressed against you there
[01:14.16]and leave the world behind
[01:17.09]On that Fourth of July
[01:25.25]So starry eyed
[01:27.99]On the flowery hillside
[01:31.67]Breathless and fervid
[01:34.57]Amid the dandelions
[01:37.62]As it swept over me
[01:40.93]Like the wind trough the trees
[01:44.73]I felt you sigh with a
[01:47.83]Sweet intensity and baby
[01:51.00]Then you put your hand in mine
[01:55.90]And we floated away
[02:03.96]Delicately lay entwined
[02:08.83]In an intimate daze
[02:16.81]A crescent moon began to shine
[02:21.71]And I wanted to stay
[02:29.83]Tangled up with you among the fireflies
[02:34.65]On that Fourth of July
[02:41.81]Thunder clouds
[02:45.13]Hung around
[02:48.33]So threateningly
[02:52.68]Ominously hovering
[02:55.97]And the sky
[02:58.50]Opened wide
[03:02.60]Showering
[03:09.08]Then you put your hand in mine
[03:13.87]And we ran from the rain
[03:21.95]Tentatively kissed goodnight
[03:26.76]And went our separate ways
[03:34.92]And Iâ€™ve never truly felt the way that I
[03:39.84]Felt the Fourth of July
[03:47.94]Truly I have never felt the same inside
[03:52.74]Like that Fourth of July
[04:00.78]Truly I could never feel the same as I
[04:05.69]Felt that Fourth of July
