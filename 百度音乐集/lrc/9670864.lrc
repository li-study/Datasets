[00:23.56]You know that you never gave me
[00:29.29]a chance to prove myself
[00:31.67]And I never thought that my life was worth your wealth
[00:37.48]You never said to me
[00:40.24]anything encouraging that I could see
[00:42.65]It's difficult to cure
[00:47.38]the pain that I've had to endure
[01:13.22]I always tried to listen
[01:16.23]even when I disagreed with you
[01:19.08]Selfish disposition
[01:21.13]makes it hardfor me to respect anything you do
[01:24.99]Then you tried to push me,
[01:26.96]but you weren't strong enough to get the job done
[01:30.53]Then you tried to hit me,
[01:32.75]but the back of your hand just isn't quick enough
[01:36.53]You are a thorn in my side,
[01:38.78]all my life you never left me alone
[01:42.34]Thorn in my side, in your mind you wish I never were born
[01:48.21]Thorn in my side, through it all I think you pushed me to fail
[01:54.02]Thorn in my side, it's about time you're recognized
[02:48.00]It's been a long time waiting for the judgment day
[02:51.55]So I can cast away
[02:54.26]The thorn that you stuck so deep inside of me
[02:57.25]It's ancient history
[02:59.93]You're always acting like a king of kings
[03:03.27]Like you were a god
[03:06.13]You wear a crown of thorns like a hat on your head
[03:09.11]My firing squad will put an end to your facade
[03:12.60]Like a thorn in my side
