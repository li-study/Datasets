[00:13.39]Where do you think you're going?
[00:16.40]Don't you know it's dark outside?
[00:19.73]Where do you think you're going?
[00:22.62]Don't you care about my pride?
[00:25.91]Where do you think you're going?
[00:29.00]I think that you don't know
[00:32.41]You got no way of knowing
[00:35.15]There's really no place you can go
[00:39.62]
[00:50.47]I understand your changes
[00:53.57]Long before you reach the door
[00:56.82]I know where you think you're going
[00:59.91]I know what you came here for
[01:03.20]And now I'm sick of joking
[01:05.83]You know I like you to be free
[01:09.04]Where do you think you're going?
[01:12.02]I think you better go with me girl
[01:15.47]
[01:27.10]You say there is no reason
[01:29.49]But you still find cause to doubt me
[01:33.25]If you ain't with me girl
[01:37.99]You're gonna be without me
[01:40.50]
[01:51.91]Where do you think you're going?
[01:54.96]Don't you know it's dark outside?
[01:57.98]Where do you think you're going?
[02:00.52]Don't you care about my pride?
[02:04.75]And now I'm sick of joking
[02:07.40]You know I like you to be free
[02:10.73]So where do you think you're going?
[02:13.74]I think you better go with me girl
