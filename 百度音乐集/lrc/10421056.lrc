[00:45.35]There is a child sleeping near his twin
[00:50.47]The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
[00:54.47]That dark angel he is shuffling in
[00:58.65]Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled
[01:12.77]
[01:13.83]The love you lost with her skin so fair
[01:20.21]Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
[01:25.22]Her green eyes blew goodbyes
[01:28.78]With her head in her hands
[01:32.42]and your kiss on the lips of another
[01:38.98]Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world.
[01:48.02]
[01:49.52]Don't be like the one who made me so old
[01:55.03]Don't be like the one who left behind his name
[01:59.80]'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
[02:05.19]And nobody ever came...
[02:07.92]
[02:13.45]Don't be like the one who made me so old
[03:30.89]Don't be like the one who left behind his name
[03:36.18]'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
[03:41.05]And nobody ever came...
[03:45.85]
[03:46.98]Don't be like the one who made me so old
[03:50.83]Don't be like the one who left behind his name
[03:56.08]'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
[04:01.27]Nobody ever came
[04:05.30]Nobody ever...
[04:07.38]
[04:09.27]I feel afraid and I call your name
[04:31.97]I love your voice and your dance insane
[04:37.05]I hear your words and I know your pain
[04:41.91]With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
[04:50.75]Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
[05:00.03]Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over
