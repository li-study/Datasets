[00:01.42]Common People
[00:03.02]Artist(Band):Pulp
[00:04.02]整理：拉登快跑
[00:08.35]She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
[00:11.64]She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
[00:14.89]That's where I caught her eye
[00:22.43]She told me that her Dad was loaded
[00:25.58]I said "In that case I'll have rum and coca-cola
[00:28.41]She said "fine"
[00:31.77]And then in 30 seconds time she said
[00:35.87]"I want to live like common people
[00:39.62]I want to do whatever common people do
[00:43.28]I want to sleep with common people
[00:46.57]I want to sleep with common people like you"
[00:51.92]Well what else could I do?
[00:54.99]I said "I'll see what I can do"
[01:01.22]I took her to a supermarket
[01:03.93]I don't know why
[01:05.26]but I had to start it somewhere
[01:08.91]so it started there
[01:14.39]I said "pretend you've got no money"
[01:17.71]but she just laughed
[01:18.96]and said "oh you're so funny"
[01:20.29]I said "Yeah
[01:22.89]Well I don't see anyone else smiling in here
[01:26.13]Are you sure
[01:27.63]you want to live like common people
[01:30.84]you want to see whatever common people see
[01:34.46]you want to sleep with common people
[01:37.62]you want to sleep with common people like me?"
[01:42.06]But she didn't understand
[01:45.02]she just smiled and held my hand
[01:49.88]Rent a flat above a shop
[01:53.28]Cut your hair and get a job
[01:56.31]Smoke some fags and play some pool
[01:59.55]Pretend you never went to school
[02:03.00]But still you'll never get it right
[02:06.06]'cos when you're laid in bed at night
[02:09.41]watching roaches climb the wall
[02:12.63]if you called your dad he could stop it all
[02:16.04]yeah
[02:17.03]You'll never live like common people
[02:20.21]You'll never do whatever common people do
[02:23.77]You'll never fail like common people
[02:26.82]You'll never watch your life slide out of view
[02:30.68]and then dance and drink and screw
[02:33.94]'cos there's nothing else to do
[03:05.09]Sing along with the common people
[03:08.54]Sing along and it might just get you throug
[03:11.53]Laugh along with the common people
[03:15.21]Laugh along although they're laughing at you
[03:18.64]and the stupid things that you do
[03:21.67]because you think that poor is cool
[03:28.06]Like a dog lying in a corner
[03:30.96]they will bite and never warn you
[03:33.16]Look out
[03:36.23]they'll tear your insides out
[03:40.37]'cos everybody hates a tourist
[03:44.29]especially one who thinks
[03:45.97]it's all such a laugh
[03:49.50]yeah and the chip stain's grease
[03:51.17]will come out in the bath
[03:52.58]You will never understand
[03:55.37]how it feels to live your life
[03:57.95]with no meaning or control
[04:01.16]and with nowhere else to go
[04:04.06]You are amazed that they exist
[04:07.52]and they burn so bright
[04:09.67]while you can only wonder why
[04:13.89]Rent a flat above a shop
[04:16.43]Cut your hair and get a job
[04:19.84]Smoke some fags and play some pool
[04:23.41]Pretend you never went to school
[04:25.49]But still you'll never get it right
[04:28.41]'cos when you're laid in bed at night
[04:31.53]watching roaches climb the wall
[04:35.42]if you called your dad he could stop it all
[04:38.79]You'll never live like common people
[04:42.09]You'll never do whatever common people do
[04:45.22]You'll never fail like common people
[04:48.63]You'll never watch your life slide out of view
[04:52.34]and dance and drink and screw
[04:55.89]'cos there's nothing else to do
[05:08.08]I want to live with common people like you.....
