[00:16.60]I see trees of green, red roses too
[00:23.90]I see them bloom for me and you
[00:29.23]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[00:41.41]I see skies of blue and clouds of white
[00:48.47]The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
[02:08.13][00:53.84]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[02:21.20][01:06.84]The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
[02:27.46][01:12.41]Are also on the faces of people going by
[02:32.74][01:18.19]I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
[02:40.09][01:25.23]They're really saying I love you.
[02:45.21][01:30.68]I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
[02:52.70][01:37.96]They'll learn much more than I'll never know
[02:58.15][01:43.22]And I think to myself what a wonderful world
[01:55.66]
[03:09.72]Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
