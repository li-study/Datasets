[00:06.47]Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
[00:11.74]And I’s feeling nearly as faded as my jeans.
[00:18.41]Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained,
[00:23.10]It rode us all the way to New Orleans.
[00:27.94]I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna,
[00:33.18]I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.
[00:38.94]Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby’s hand in mine,
[00:44.65]We sang every song that driver knew.
[00:49.50]Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
[00:54.85]Nothing don’t mean nothing honey if it ain’t free, now now.
[00:59.82]And feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,
[01:04.81]You know feeling good was good enough for me,
[01:08.15]Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.
[01:15.22]From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,
[01:23.38]Hey, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.
[01:28.67]Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we done,
[01:33.70]Hey Bobby baby kept me from the cold.
[01:38.82]One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,
[01:44.02]He’s looking for that home and I hope he finds it,
[01:49.35]But I’d trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
[01:54.13]To be holding Bobby’s body next to mine.
[01:59.72]Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
[02:04.91]Nothing, that’s all that Bobby left me, yeah,
[02:09.64]But feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,
[02:14.75]Hey, feeling good was good enough for me, hmm hmm,
[02:20.94]Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.
