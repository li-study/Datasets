[00:02.00]Sacrifice
[00:05.00]Elton John
[00:12.00]Available on the album Sleeping With The Past
[00:17.00]It's a human sign
[00:21.00]When things go wrong
[00:25.00]When the scent of her lingers
[00:30.00]And temptation's strong
[00:34.00]Into the boundary
[00:39.00]Of each married man
[00:43.00]Sweet deceit comes calling
[00:47.00]And negativity lands
[03:36.00][02:23.00][00:51.00]Cold cold heart
[03:40.00][02:26.00][00:55.00]Hard done by you
[03:44.00][02:31.00][01:00.00]Some things look better baby
[03:48.00][02:35.00][01:04.00]Just passing through
[03:53.00][02:40.00][01:09.00]And it's no sacrifice
[03:57.00][02:44.00][01:13.00]Just a simple word
[04:01.00][02:48.00][01:17.00]It's two hearts living
[04:05.00][02:52.00][01:21.00]In two separate worlds
[04:10.00][02:57.00][01:26.00]But it's no sacrifice
[04:15.00][03:02.00][01:31.00]No sacrifice
[04:39.00][04:30.00][04:20.00][03:06.00][01:35.00]It's no sacrifice at all
[01:49.00]Mutual misunderstanding
[01:52.00]After the fact
[01:56.00]Sensitivity builds a prison
[02:00.00]In the final act
[02:05.00]We lose direction
[02:09.00]No stone unturned
[02:13.00]No tears to damn you
[02:17.00]When jealousy burns
