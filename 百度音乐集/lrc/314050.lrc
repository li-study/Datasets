[00:22.53]I was young but I wasn't naive
[00:28.07]I watched helpless as he turned around to leave
[00:33.23]and still I have the pain I have to carry
[00:38.44]a past so deep
[00:41.61]that even you could not bury if you tried
[02:12.31][00:46.73]
[02:17.82][00:55.88]after all this time
[02:23.26][01:00.65]I never thought we'd be here
[02:26.06][01:03.83]never thought we'd be here
[02:28.74][01:06.22]when my love for you was blind
[03:40.74][02:34.04][01:12.01]but I couldn't make you see it
[03:43.91][02:37.02][01:14.95]couldn't make you see it
[03:46.57][02:39.45][01:17.53]that I loved you more than you'll ever know
[03:57.32][02:50.54][01:28.34]a part of me died when I let you go
[03:02.81][01:42.58]
[01:47.62]I would fall asleep
[01:50.04]only in hopes of dreaming
[01:53.55]that everything would be like is was before
[01:58.75]but nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting
[02:04.54]they disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
[03:24.97]after all this time
[03:29.83]would you ever wanna leave it
[03:32.64]maybe you could not believe it
[03:35.35]that my love for you was blind
[04:08.47]and I loved you more than you'll ever know
[04:19.49]a part of me dies when I let you go
