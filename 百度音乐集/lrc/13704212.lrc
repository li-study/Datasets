[00:03.08]All my life I've been waiting
[00:07.20]For you to bring a fairy tale my way
[00:10.79]Been living in a fantasy without meaning
[00:16.04]It's not okay I don't feel safe
[00:22.31]
[00:29.97]I don't feel safe..
[00:33.00]Ohhh..
[V1]
[00:40.31]Left broken empty in despair
[00:43.08]Wanna breath can't find air
[00:44.96]Thought you were sent from up above
[00:47.61]But you and me never had love
[00:50.00]So much more I have to say
[00:52.74]Help me find a way
[00:56.24]
[CHORUS]
[00:57.26]And I wonder if you know
[00:59.31]How it really feels
[01:01.68]To be left outside alone
[01:04.14]When it's cold out here
[01:06.45]Well maybe you should know
[01:08.91]Just how it feels
[01:11.70]To be left outside alone
[01:13.41]To be left outside alone
[01:16.24]I tell ya..
[01:17.35]All my life I've been waiting
[01:18.28]For you to bring a fairytale my way
[01:24.89]Been living in a fantasy without meaning
[01:30.40]It's not okay I don't feel safe
[01:34.98]I need to pray
[01:38.67]
[01:40.00]Why do you play me like a game?
[01:43.17]Always someone else to blame
[01:46.20]Careless, helpless little man
[01:48.45]Someday you might understand
[01:51.12]There's not much more to say
[01:53.50]But I hope you find a way
[01:55.72]
[01:56.91][CHORUS 2]
[01:57.93]Still I wonder if you know
[02:00.47]How it really feels
[02:02.78]To be left outside alone
[02:05.10]When it's cold out here
[02:07.41]Well maybe you should know
[02:09.67]Just how it feels
[02:11.98]To be left outside alone
[02:14.26]To be left outside alone
[02:16.99]
[02:17.57]I tell ya..
[02:19.28]All my life I've been waiting
[02:21.45]For you to bring a fairytale my way
[02:25.84]Been living in a fantasy without meaning
[02:31.13]It's not okay I don't feel safe
[02:36.01]I need to pray
[02:46.91]Save me.. Ohhhh..
[02:50.70]Whoaooooaoooooo
[CHORUS 3]

[02:58.67]To be left outside alone
[03:00.93]When it's cold out here
[03:03.10]Well maybe you should know
[03:05.48]Just how it feels
[03:07.71]To be left outside alone
[03:10.06]To be left outside alone
[03:12.57]
[03:13.72][OUTRO]
