[00:02.78] 独孤寻欢编辑
[00:08.88]It's cold outside so understand
[00:13.25]if I don't hang around to wait
[00:18.03]I'll say goodbye and kiss your hand
[00:22.69]and then get on with being brave
[00:27.75]but don't expect to wipe away the tears
[00:33.81]cos you know they belong
[00:37.65]and someone else just went away
[00:42.15]before I ever came along
[00:52.58][00:47.04]and tried to melt the snow
[03:38.27][02:57.41][02:16.62][01:37.47][00:56.80]
[03:38.89][03:16.60][02:58.16][02:18.38][01:17.78][00:57.98]and meanwhile I'll be here
[03:43.45][03:21.81][03:02.08][02:22.62][01:21.76][01:02.13]and I pray to god above
[03:07.06][01:07.31]that someday you might learn again
[01:12.46]its you I'm dreaming of
[01:26.63]that someday you might turn again to me
[03:31.50][01:33.75]your one and ever love
[01:38.26]Its cold outside so understand
[01:43.11]If I don't hang around and cry
[01:47.97]I let you go without a word
[01:52.74]a memory bluer that the sky
[01:57.49]and I've tried not to watch you go
[02:02.20]and ill try not to stand alone
[02:12.55][02:07.10]behind you in the snow
[03:48.09][02:27.31]that someday you might turn again to me
[02:33.91]your one and ever, one and ever
[02:38.95]carry me away
[02:42.68]to a world that doesn't lead to you so
[02:47.95]I don't have to say
[02:52.47]for all the days you wanna be there
[03:12.22]it's you I'm dreaming of
[03:26.33]that someday you might turn to me again
[03:55.54]your one and ever, love
