[00:07.34]Whitney Houston
[00:11.04]
[00:15.61]Did you really think that
[00:18.73]I would really take you back
[00:21.96]Let you back in my heart one more time
[00:26.66]Ohh no, no
[00:28.39]Did you think that I'd still care
[00:31.84]That there'd be more feeling there
[00:34.44]Did you think you could walk back in my life, ohh
[00:41.18]So you found you miss the love you threw away, ah
[00:47.62]Baby but you found it out too late, too late
[00:54.51]
[00:55.18]And so you know the way it feels to cry
[01:02.45]The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
[01:07.68]Baby I learned the way to break a heart
[01:15.07]I learned from the best
[01:17.84]I learned from you
[01:21.94]Oh baby now
[01:24.41]I learned from you
[01:26.43]I remember cold nights
[01:29.31]Tears I though would never dry
[01:32.45]How you shattered my world
[01:34.91]With your goodbye, your goodbye baby
[01:38.87]I would've sold my soul then
[01:42.06]Just to have you back again
[01:45.29]Now you're the last thing on my mind
[01:52.22]Now you say you're sorry and you've changed your ways
[01:58.06]Baby but you changed you ways too late
[02:05.72]And so you know the way it feels to cry
[02:13.00]The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
[02:18.23]Baby I learned the way to break a heart
[02:25.81]I learned from the best
[02:28.55]I learned from you
[02:31.57]Oh baby now
[02:34.79]I learned from you
[02:39.83]So when all you've got are sleepless nights
[02:46.29]And those tears are clouding up your eyes
[02:53.23]Just remember it was you who said goodbye
[03:01.57]Who said goodbye
[03:09.47]
[03:26.21]And so you know the way it feels to cry
[03:33.56]The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
[03:40.24]I learned the way to break a heart
[03:46.38]I learned from the best
[03:49.28]I learned from you
[03:51.08]I learned the way to break a heart
[03:56.89]I learned from the best
[03:58.76]I learned from you

[04:05.70]I learned from you
