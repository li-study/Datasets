[00:10.53]Do you remember when we first meet?
[00:14.04]I sure do
[00:15.54]In was some time in early September
[00:20.87]You were lazy about it
[00:23.79]you made me wait around
[00:25.87]I was so crazy about you I didn't mind
[00:31.22]I was late for class
[00:33.68]I locked my bike to yours
[00:36.14]It wasn't hard to find
[00:38.60]you painted flowers on it
[00:41.80]I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
[00:46.34]you might not roll back my direction real soon
[00:52.24]i was crazy about you then and now
[00:55.25]the craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
[01:02.55]and you're still mine
[01:05.45]we're locked in time
[01:08.49]let's rewind
[01:13.39]do you remember when we first moved in together?
[01:18.91]the piano took up the living room
[01:23.73]you played me boogie-woogie
[01:26.59]i played you love songs
[01:28.75]you'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
[01:34.16]we built our getaway up in a tree we found
[01:38.79]we felt so far away but we were still in town
[01:44.33]now i remember watching that old tree burn down
[01:49.55]i took a picture that i don't like to look at
[01:55.97]well all these times they come and go
[01:58.28]and alone don't seem so long
[02:00.54]over ten years have gone by
[02:05.81]we can't rewind
[02:08.22]we're locked in time
[02:10.93]but you're still mine
[02:16.37]do you remember?
