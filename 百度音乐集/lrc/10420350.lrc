[00:13.85]I'm sitting here in a boring room
[00:16.89]It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
[00:20.31]I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
[00:23.59]I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
[00:26.83]But nothing ever happens and I wonder
[00:32.07]
[00:33.78]I'm driving around in my car
[00:37.17]I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
[00:40.37]I'd like to change my point of view
[00:43.55]I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
[00:46.93]But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
[02:20.46][00:51.81]
[02:21.34][00:54.01]I wonder how, I wonder why
[02:24.73][00:57.34]Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
[02:27.84][01:00.60]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[02:34.30][01:07.01]I'm turning my head up and down
[02:38.03][01:10.70]I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
[02:41.29][01:13.94]And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[01:21.02]La, la da dee da, etc.
[01:31.91]
[01:34.28]I'm sitting here, I miss the power
[01:37.47]I'd like to go out taking a shower
[01:40.66]But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
[01:44.01]I feel so tired, put myself into bed
[01:47.46]Where nothing ever happens  and I wonder
[01:52.18]
[01:55.08]Isolation is not good for me
[02:01.64]Isolation  I don't want to sit on a lemon tree
[02:07.94]I'm stepping around in a dessert of joy
[02:11.11]Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
[02:14.24]And everything will happen and you'll wonder
[02:46.94]
[02:48.31]I wonder how I wonder why
[02:51.49]Yesterday you told me about the blue sky
[02:54.65]And all that I can see
[02:58.21]And all that I can see
[03:01.49]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[03:08.92]
