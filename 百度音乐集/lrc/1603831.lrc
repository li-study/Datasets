[00:10.08]They sat together in the park
[00:13.62]As the evening sky grew dark
[00:18.15]She looked at him
[00:19.60]He felt a spark tingle to his bones
[00:25.20]Twas when he felt alone
[00:29.03]And wished that he'd gone straight
[00:33.75]And watched out for a simple twist of fate
[00:38.64]
[00:42.02]They walked down by the old canal
[00:46.06]A little confused I remember well
[00:50.27]And then they stopped in a strange hotel
[00:53.55]With the neon burning bright
[00:57.18]He felt the heat of the night
[01:01.08]Hit him like a freight train
[01:06.14]And moving with a simple twist of fate
[01:10.76]
[01:14.46]Saxaphone some place nearby played
[01:18.42]She was walking on by at the arcade
[01:22.53]As a light burst through a bead of shade
[01:25.82]But as he was waking
[01:29.97]She dropprd a coin into a cup of a blind man
[01:38.47]That became and both got a bout
[01:40.61]Of a simple twist of fate
[01:45.89]
[02:19.05]He woke up and the room was bear
[02:22.35]He didn't see he anywhere
[02:25.98]He told himself he didn't care
[02:29.95]He pushed the window open wide
[02:33.65]He felt an emptyness inside too
[02:37.96]He could just not relate
[02:42.71]But by a simple twist of fate
[02:48.62]
[02:51.25]He hears the ticking of the clocks
[02:54.45]Small waves whisper to the rocks
[02:58.37]He hunts her down by the waterfront docks
[03:02.21]Where the sailors all come in
[03:05.68]Perhaps he'll see her once again
[03:09.80]How long must he wait once more
[03:15.84]For a simple twist of fate
[03:20.83]
[03:22.76]People tell me it's a crime
[03:26.78]To feel to much at any one time
[03:30.66]All it cost me was a dime
[03:34.30]But the bells refuse to ring
[03:37.98]He was born in the spring
[03:42.08]But I was born to late to blame
[03:47.85]It on a simple twist of fate
