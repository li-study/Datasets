[00:10.74]Midnight In Chelsea
[00:12.41]Bon Jovi & Jon Bon Jovi
[00:24.07]The kids 'round here look just like sticks
[00:26.97]They trade old licks with a beat up six
[00:28.97]I just smile and catch the groove
[00:33.40]Gothic girls all dress in black
[00:35.81]Serious as heart attacks
[00:38.24]It takes a little bit of getting used to
[00:43.19]The old man with the whiskey stains
[00:45.62]Lost the night forgot his name
[00:49.19]His poor wife will sleep alone again
[00:52.97]And it ain't hard to understand
[00:57.73]Why she's holding on to her own hand
[01:01.33]It's midnight in Chelsea,
[01:05.88]midnight in Chelsea
[01:12.24]No one's asking me for favors
[01:14.18]No one's looking for a savoir
[01:16.85]They're too busy saving me
[01:32.16]I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive
[01:34.23]seems her chauffeur took a dive
[01:37.62]And sold her secrets to the sun
[01:40.89]And later in a magazine
[01:43.40]I finally figured what it means
[01:47.27]To be a saint, not a queen
[01:50.83]Two lustful lovers catch a spark
[01:53.40]And chase their shadows in the dark
[01:56.02]Someone's getting off tonight
[02:00.75]Of a big red bus that's packed so tight
[02:03.20]It disappears in a trail of light
[02:05.53]Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...
[02:09.26]It's midnight in Chelsea,
[02:13.76]midnight in Chelsea
[02:19.36]No one's asking me for favors
[02:21.95]No one's looking for a savoir
[02:24.77]They're too busy saving me
[02:33.19]Midnight in Chelsea,
[02:38.89]No one's pinned dreams on me
[02:41.44]No one's asking me to bleed
[02:43.91]I'm the man I want to be
[02:47.24]When Chelsea girls sing...
[03:14.37]It's morning when I go to sleep
[03:17.05]In the distant dawn a church bell rings
[03:20.58]Another day is coming on
[03:24.35]A baby's born, an old man dies
[03:26.42]Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye
[03:29.75]I leave my soul and just move on
[03:34.14]And wish that I was there to sing this song
[04:00.29]It's midnight in Chelsea,
[04:05.20]midnight in Chelsea
[04:10.82]No one's asking me for favors
[04:13.61]No one's looking for a savoir
[04:15.92]They're too busy saving me
[04:19.62]It's midnight in Chelsea,
[04:30.92]No one's pinned dreams on me
[04:32.99]No one's asking me to bleed
[04:35.33]I'm the man I want to be
[04:38.16]The man I want to be,the man I want to be
[04:44.35]It's midnight in Chelsea,
