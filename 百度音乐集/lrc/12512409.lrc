[00:57.48]Feelin' that it's gone
[01:01.70]Can change your mind
[01:05.02]If we can't go on
[01:09.12]To survive the tide love divides
[01:14.87]
[01:15.36]Someday love will find you
[01:19.08]Break those chains that bind you
[01:23.07]One night will remind you
[01:26.33]How we touched And went our separate ways
[01:30.46]If he ever hurts you
[01:34.23]True love won't desert you
