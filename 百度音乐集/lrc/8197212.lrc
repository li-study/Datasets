[00:08.45]
[00:09.50]Wake up in the morning with a head
[00:12.04]like 'what ya done?'
[00:13.99]This used to be the life
[00:15.40]but I don't need another one.
[00:18.41]Good luck cuttin' nothin',
[00:20.29]carrying on, you wear them gowns.
[00:22.71]So how come I feel so lonely
[00:24.81]when you're up getting down?
[00:26.79]So I play along when I hear that favourite song
[00:31.71]I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.
[00:36.12]You better know
[00:37.91]when you're swingin' round the room
[00:40.60]Look's like magic's solely yours tonight
[00:44.59]But I don't feel like dancin'
[00:46.77]When the old Joanna plays
[00:49.27]My heart could take a chance
[00:51.50]But my two feet can't find a way
[00:53.39]You think that I could muster up a little soft,
[00:56.01]shoop devil sway
[00:58.09]But I don't feel like dancin'
[01:00.05]No sir, no dancin' today.
[01:02.06]Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
[01:04.54]Even if i find nothin' better to do
[01:06.49]Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
[01:08.99]Why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood?
[01:10.92]Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
[01:13.38]Rather be home with no one
[01:14.77]when I can't get down with you
[01:17.77]
[01:38.42]Cities come and cities go
[01:40.38]just like the old empires
[01:42.80]When all you do is change your clothes
[01:44.67]and call that versatile.
[01:47.22]You got so many colours
[01:48.98]make a blind man so confused.
[01:51.42]Then why can't I keep up
[01:53.18]when you're the only thing I lose?
[01:55.61]So I'll just pretend
[01:57.62]that I know which way to bend
[02:00.34]And I'm gonna tell the whole world
[02:02.18]that you're mine.
[02:04.91]Just please understand,
[02:06.66]when I see you clap your hands
[02:09.23]If you stick around
[02:10.52]I'm sure that you'll be fine.
[02:13.46]But I don't feel like dancin'
[02:15.62]When the old Joanna plays
[02:18.05]My heart could take a chance
[02:19.82]But my two feet can't find a way
[02:21.99]You think that I could muster up a little soft,
[02:25.30]shoop devil sway
[02:26.73]But I don't feel like dancinâ€™
[02:28.79]No sir, no dancin' today.
[02:30.68]Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
[02:33.15]Even if i find nothin' better to do

[02:37.52]Why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood?
[02:39.62]Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
[02:42.00]Rather be home with no one
[02:43.45]when I can't get down with you
[02:46.85]
[03:07.06]You can't make me dance around
[03:10.61]But your two-step makes my chest pound.
[03:15.13]Just lay me down as you blow it away
[03:19.54]into the shimmer light
[03:26.07]
[03:26.42]But I don't feel like dancin'
[03:28.64]When the old Joanna plays
[03:31.14]My heart could take a chance
