[00:30.31]Falling fast and falling free
[00:33.45]you look to find a friend
[00:38.15]Falling fast and falling free
[00:41.63]this could just be the end
[00:46.22]Falling fast you stoop to touch
[00:49.82]and kiss the flowers that bend
[00:53.91]And you're ready now
[00:56.99]For the harvest breed
