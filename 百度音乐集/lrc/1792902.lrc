[00:02.00]Kat DeLuna - In The End
[00:20.00]
[00:29.50]I'm the textbook definition of a rebel
[00:33.65]I see the crumble over left and I've gotta go right
[00:38.20]I'm always in some trouble
[00:41.47]To me life ain't fun unless you're in a good fight
[01:30.20][00:45.60]So the more you're good to me
[01:33.16][00:48.60]The more I try to get you to leave
[02:59.01][02:36.17][01:37.11][00:52.40]All my life I've made excuses
[03:02.60][02:40.26][01:40.57][00:55.95]Pushing you away,
[03:04.45][02:42.19][01:42.61][00:57.99]saying that you're not for me
[03:06.51][02:44.14][01:45.09][01:00.57]All my life I've ran from you, babe
[03:10.14][02:47.77][01:48.30][01:03.64]I tried everything
[03:12.00][02:49.72][01:50.22][01:05.62]In the end it was you
[03:17.74][02:57.22][01:55.47][01:10.87]In the end, in the end it was you
[01:14.69]All I wanna do is have a good time
[01:18.50]Let the beat go through me and just take me away
[01:22.50]You've been trying to get with me for a while
[01:26.29]And I've been telling you to save that for another day
[02:14.55][01:59.30]No no no, I never would've thought
[02:17.75][02:02.87]You'd be the one
[02:19.62][02:04.65]That I'd be with in the end
[02:22.33][02:06.93]Lately, I never would've dreamed
[02:25.12][02:10.20]That you and me
[02:26.99][02:12.01]Would be together in the end
