[00:30.83]Think about it 'till anticipation makes you shake and we both lose control.
[00:39.28]Put the pedal to the floor, lay the seat back, lock the doors,
[00:44.03]we're gonna make this worth our while.
[00:50.24]It's getting harder to breathe...
[00:55.85]
[01:00.93]"Jealous hearts will leave us all in ruins,"
[01:06.44]that's what we'll say (that's what we'll say)
[01:11.16]as we hide out from our friends
[01:14.01]hear the message once again,
[01:16.45]"Lets get this right." (Lets get this right)
[01:21.44]
[01:21.57]Your lips are a hot flame, baby and our chemistry is kerosene...
[01:30.38]Take it off, take it all off
[01:34.65]maybe we can get down and burn up in the heat...
[01:46.05]
[02:06.36]Times like these feel so dangerous,
[02:16.87]When you know you're gonna find out,
[02:22.22]how right it feels, (how right it feels)
[02:27.19]to ignore the ones you love the most,
[02:31.74]This can't be right. (This can't be right)
[02:37.77]
[02:57.58]Your lips are a hot flame, baby and our chemistry is kerosene...
[03:06.89]As we kiss to the sound of your stereo
[03:12.22]don't say a word... I won't say a word...
[03:17.00]
[03:17.05]Don't treat this like a secret,
[03:22.49]just keep it quiet while we know that we could tear best friends apart
[03:33.31]with all the lies we've told...
[03:38.14]
[03:38.24]Your lips are a hot flame, baby and our chemistry is kerosene...
[03:48.06]Take it off, take it all off, maybe,
[03:52.49]and I'm lost for words when thoughts don't compare - write it down...
[03:59.25]
