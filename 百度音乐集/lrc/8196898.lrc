[00:13.06]Across the purple sky
[00:17.03]All the birds are leaving
[00:25.64]But how can they know
[00:29.28]It was time for them to go?
[00:36.79]By the winter fire
[00:41.00]I will still be dreaming
[00:47.62]I did not count the time
[00:56.72]For who knows where the time goes?
[01:01.65]Who knows where the time goes?
[01:16.70]Sad, deserted shore
[01:21.28]Your fickle friends are leaving
[01:30.03]Oh, but then you know
[01:33.35]It was time for them to go
[01:40.75]But I will still be here
[01:45.18]I have no thought of leaving
[01:51.42]I did not count the time
[01:59.04]For who knows where the time goes?
[02:05.14]Who knows where the time goes?
[02:21.64]And I am not alone while my love is near me
[02:32.94]I know it will be so until it's time to go
[02:44.22]Oh the storms in winter
[02:49.28]And then the birds in spring again
[02:54.41]I did not count the time
[03:02.05]For who knows where the time goes?
[03:07.91]And who knows where the time goes?
[03:13.83]Who knows where the time goes?
