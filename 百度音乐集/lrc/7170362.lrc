[00:04.83]
[00:08.06]I came home and nothing was right
[00:13.80]It's been a while since a fight
[00:17.77]Well maybe tonight
[00:22.37]my need for love
[00:25.87]Can crowd my sight
[00:28.50]And I say things out of spite
[00:32.95]Or I push you aside
[00:37.07]I don't know how to fix it
[00:43.50]I am falling apart
[00:47.25]and I am breaking your heart
[00:52.33]Help me to see
[00:58.05]Cause I am blinded by love blinded by love
[01:06.94]And help me to be the one to guide us
[01:15.71]Through the dark things we do
[01:20.67]
[01:21.33]Now I know I can be tough sometimes
[01:27.65]My words come out like knives
[01:32.58]Cutting the space between us
[01:36.72]And you try yeah I know you try
[01:42.28]To just let things slide
[01:46.81]But what good is that to us
[01:51.13]Oh  oh  I don't know
[01:57.88]I am falling apart
[02:01.21]and I am breaking your heart
[02:06.06]Help me to see
[02:11.90]Cause I am blinded by love blinded by love
[02:20.61]And help me to be the one to guide us Through
[02:31.13]the dark things we do
[02:35.12]Oh  I don't know what possibly changed
[02:41.63]We were so good  so good
[02:48.92]And where is the light at the end of this tunnel
[02:56.49]Cause I am falling apart
[03:00.24]and I am breaking your heart
[03:04.76]Help me to see
[03:10.97]Cause I am blinded by love blinded by love
[03:19.71]And help me to be the one to guide us Through
[03:30.15]the dark things we do
[03:35.58]
