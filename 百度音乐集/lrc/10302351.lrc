[00:03.73]The The"Your Cheatin' Heart"歌词
[00:11.15]
[00:15.00]Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
[00:23.01]You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
[00:31.82]But sleep won't come
[00:35.91]The whole night through
[00:40.00]Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
[00:48.00]When tears come down like fallin' rain
[00:56.90]You'll toss around and call my name
[01:05.02]You'll walk the floor the way i do
[01:13.06]Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
[01:20.67]
[01:54.85]Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
[02:02.94]And crave the love you threw away
[02:10.92]The time will come when you'll be blue
[02:20.00]Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
[02:28.03]When tears come down like fallin' rain
[02:36.13]You'll toss around and call my name
[02:45.05]You'll walk the floor the way i do
[02:53.00]Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
[02:59.44]。
