[00:00.00]Find your dreams come true
[00:04.73]And I wonder if you know
[00:09.61]What it means, what it means
[00:14.78]And I wonder if you know
[00:19.34]What it means, what it means
[00:24.82]And I wonder if you know
[00:29.54]What it means to find your dreams
[00:33.59]
[00:35.22]I\'ve been waiting on this my whole life
[00:45.78]These dreams be waking me up at night
[00:55.86]You say I think I\'m never wrong
[01:05.37]You know what, maybe you\'re right, aight
[01:13.82]
[01:15.32]And I wonder if you know
[01:19.51]What it means, what it means
[01:25.13]And I wonder if you know
[01:29.61]What it means to find your dreams
[01:33.74]
[01:45.86]You hope that he get what he deserves, word
[01:55.60]Do you even remember what the issue is
[01:58.95]You just trying to find where the tissue is
[02:01.35]You can still be who you wish you is
[02:03.35]It ain\'t happen yet
[02:04.54]And that\'s what the intuition is
[02:06.56]When you hop back in the car
[02:08.03]Drive back to the crib
[02:09.53]Run back to their arms
[02:11.10]The smokescreens
[02:12.30]The chokes and the screams
[02:13.68]You ever wonder what it all really mean
[02:15.57]
[02:16.07]And I wonder if you know
[02:19.76]What it means, what it means
[02:25.53]And I wonder if you know
[02:29.92]What it means to find your dreams
[02:34.48]
[02:36.01]And I\'m back on my grind
[02:39.64]A psychic read my lifeline
[02:41.40]Told me in my lifetime
[02:42.77]My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
[02:44.96]And that\'s what I\'m
[02:46.86]Seven o\'clock, that\'s primetime
[02:48.78]Heaven\'ll watch, God calling from the hotlines
[02:51.87]Why he keep giving me hot lines
[02:54.21]I\'m a star, how could I not shine
[02:56.47]How many ladies in the house
[02:58.22]How many ladies in the house without a spouse
[03:01.10]Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
[03:04.51]What you about
[03:06.62]On that independent shit
[03:08.80]Trade it all for a husband and some kids
[03:11.47]You ever wonder what it all really mean
[03:13.89]You ever wonder if you\'ll find your dreams
