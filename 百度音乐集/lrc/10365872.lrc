[00:03.53]
[00:13.78]She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit and bambi eyes
[00:20.19]Everybody who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
[00:27.42]I should have known I was wrong
[00:30.88]When I left her for a life in pity but
[00:33.98]They say you never miss the water til it's gone
[00:39.70]Guess I failed to love you
[00:43.34]And you're taking it out tonight
[01:49.03][00:47.41]How am I supposed to walk on by
[01:52.89][00:51.30]When you're looking like that
[01:55.18][00:53.59]I can't believe what I just gave away
[01:59.05][00:57.42]Now I can't take it back
[03:38.05][02:01.70][01:00.08]I don't wanna get lost
[03:39.60][02:04.94][01:03.32]I don't wanna live my life without you
[02:08.37][01:06.48]How am I supposed to walk on by
[02:13.13][01:11.46]When you are looking like that
[01:15.57]She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
[01:21.83]Wanna squeeze her real tight get out of this place
[01:25.48]If only I could take control
[01:29.30]But she's out of my reach forever
[01:32.46]And just a week ago she lied next to me
[01:35.56]It's so ironic how I had to lose just to see
[01:41.28]That I failed to love you
[01:44.90]And you're taking it out tonight
[02:16.26]I dont wanna forget you
[02:19.51]I dont even wanna try
[02:22.67]How am I supposed to walk on by
[02:27.88]When you're looking like that
