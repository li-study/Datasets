[00:10.12]If you go away on this summer day
[00:14.65]Then you might as well take the sun away
[00:19.38]All the birds that flew in the summer sky
[00:24.79]When our love was new
[00:28.26]and our hearts were high
[00:31.16]When the day was young
[00:33.67]and the night was long
[00:35.28]And the moon stood still
[00:39.36]for the night bird's sang
[00:42.16]If you go away
[00:52.10][02:32.39]But if you stay I'll make you a day
[00:56.10][02:36.65]Like no day has been or we'll be again
[01:03.15][02:42.19]We'll sail the sun
[01:04.20][02:45.26]we'll ride on the rain
[01:08.29][02:48.39]We'll talk to the trees
[01:11.08][02:51.19]we'll worship the wind
[01:16.29][02:57.26]And if you go I'll understand
[01:20.45][03:01.59]Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand
[01:29.90][03:08.89]If you go away
[01:32.19][03:11.69]If you go away
[01:36.19][03:15.99]<music>
[01:49.49]If you go away
[01:52.19]As I'm the real must there'll be nothing left
[01:57.59]In the world to trust just an empty room
[02:02.39]Full of empty space like the empty look
[02:07.25]I see on your face
[02:11.25]I'll be the shadow of your shadow
[02:15.40]I fell you might have kept me by your side
[02:21.40]If you go away
[02:24.19]If you go away

[03:33.00]献给我爱的芳，想不出别出心裁的话
[03:36.10]就援引一句吧：如果明天不得不各自离去，
[03:39.30]越过大海都会和你不断邂逅于梦中，
[03:41.36]冬去春来，斗转星移，而我的心却不变---
[03:43.99]就如从未离开！
[03:44.10]如果可以，我愿陪你一生!
