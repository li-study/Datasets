[00:00.89]Amos Moses
[00:01.26]
[00:05.19]Yeah here comes Amos.
[00:09.60]Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
[00:12.08]He lived by himself in the swamp
[00:14.25]He hunted alligator for a living
[00:16.39]He'd just knock them in the head with a stump
[00:19.06]The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos
[00:23.52]It ain't legal hunting alligator down in the swamp boy
[00:25.75]
[00:28.61]Now everyone blamed his old man
[00:30.52]For making him mean as a snake
[00:32.70]When Amos Moses was a boy
[00:34.25]His daddy would use him for alligator bait
[00:37.10]Tie a rope around his neck and throw him in the swamp
[00:41.90]Alligator man in the Louisiana bayou
[00:46.13]About forty-five minutes south of Tippitoe Louisiana
[00:50.65]Lived a man called Dr. Mills South and his pretty wife Hannah
[00:55.19]They raised up a son who could eat his weight in groceries
[00:59.84]Named him after a man of the cloth
[01:02.72]Called him Amos Moses
[01:03.93]
[01:08.62]Now the folks around south Louisiana
[01:11.09]Said Amos was a hell of a man
[01:13.37]He could trap the biggest meanest alligator
[01:15.93]And he'd just use one hand
[01:17.87]That's all he got left cause an alligator bit it
[01:22.50]Left arm gone clear up to the elbow
[01:24.83]
[01:27.00]Well the sheriff caught wind that Amos was up in the swamp
[01:29.09]Trading alligator skins
[01:31.49]So he snuck in the swamp gonna get the boy
[01:33.65]But he never came out
[01:36.01]Well I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
[01:40.38]Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou
[01:45.04]About forty-five minutes south of Tippitoe Louisiana
[01:49.51]Lived a cat named Dr. Mills South and his pretty wife Hannah
[01:54.03]They raised up a son who could eat his weight in groceries
[01:58.69]Named him after a man of the cloth
[02:01.21]Called him Amos Moses
[02:02.56]
[02:03.41]I know son
[02:05.54]Make it count son
[02:07.47]About forty-five minutes south of Tippitoe Louisiana...
