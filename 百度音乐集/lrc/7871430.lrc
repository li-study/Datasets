[00:01.25]~Intro~
[01:42.07]
[01:49.80]The smile of dawn
[01:52.03]Arrived early May
[01:54.31]She carried a gift from her home
[01:58.91]The night shed a tear
[02:01.11]To tell her of fear
[02:03.54]And of sorrow and pain
[02:06.22]She'll never outgrow
[02:09.29]
[02:09.41]Death is the first dance, eternal
[02:13.75]
[02:14.32]There's no more freedom
[02:18.87]The both of you will be confined to this mind
[02:32.97]
[02:37.55]I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
[02:44.30]I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
[02:50.74]I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
[02:58.22]I was told if you dream of the next world
[03:02.07]You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire
[03:09.67]
[03:10.03]As a child, I thought I could live without pain without sorrow
[03:18.60]As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
[03:22.57]I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid
[03:34.98]
[03:35.89]Somewhere like a scene from a memory
[03:41.00]There's a picture worth a thousand words
[03:45.63]Eluding stares from faces before me
[03:50.17]It hides away and will never be heard of again
[03:54.76]
[03:54.91]Deceit is the second without end
[03:58.99]
[03:58.81]The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
[04:03.73]Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive
[04:10.58]
[04:11.54]The third arrives...
[04:17.71]
[04:18.40]~Bridge~
[08:04.00]
[08:17.60]Before the leaves have fallen
[08:23.60]Before we lock the doors
[08:31.72]There must be the third and last dance
[08:35.42]This one will last forever
[08:39.08]Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
[08:42.95]She's taken you to your home
[08:45.11]
[08:46.53]It can only take place
[08:47.96]When the struggle between our children has ended
[08:53.51]Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love
[09:05.23]
[09:05.48]Love is the Dance of Eternity
[09:14.34]
