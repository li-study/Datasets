[00:03.32]Scissor Sisters
[00:04.46]
[00:07.64]You can see that
[00:09.64]You're being surrounded every direction,
[00:14.89]Love was just something
[00:17.70]You found to add to your collection,
[00:22.70]It used to seem we were number one,
[00:25.86]But now it sounds so far away,
[00:30.08]I had a dream we were running
[00:32.39]From some blazing arrows yesterday,
[00:35.59]
[00:36.17]You said fight fire with fire,
[00:38.43]Fire with fire, fire with fire
[00:44.05]Through desire, desi- sire,
[00:46.49]Desi-, through your desire
[00:50.97]
[00:58.59]Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising,
[01:05.62]You can show me the work that you've done,
[01:09.59]Your fears have been disguising,
[01:13.66]Is it just me or is everyone,
[01:16.91]Hiding out between the lights,
[01:20.97]Where will we be when we come undone?
[01:23.96]Just a simple meeting of the minds
[01:26.65]
[01:27.19]Singing we'll fight fire with fire,
[01:29.26]Fire with fire, fire with fire
[01:34.68]Through desire, desi- sire, desi-,
[01:38.15]Through your desire
[01:41.87]We'll fight fire with fire,
[01:44.59]Fire with fire, fire with fire
[01:49.46]Your desire, desi- sire,
[01:51.78]Desi-, through your desire
[01:56.05]
[01:58.08]And while living in your stars
[02:05.29]There's a million else burning brightly just like fire fight,
[02:15.58]
[02:22.44]It's cold and heaven surround you every direction,
[02:29.23]Cause there's someone behind every hand that
[02:33.35]You've made a connection
[02:37.21]And now we're free to be number one,
[02:40.56]Morning isn't far away,
[02:44.54]I had a dream we were holding on,
[02:47.66]And tomorrow as we come today, we come today
[02:56.53]
[02:57.93]And we'll fight with fire,
[03:00.17]Fire with fire, fire with fire
[03:05.61]Through desire, desi- sire,
[03:08.24]Desi-, through your desire
[03:12.50]We'll fight fire with fire,
[03:15.13]Fire with fire, fire with fire
[03:20.34]Your desire, desi- sire,
[03:22.69]Desi-, through your desire
[03:28.23]
