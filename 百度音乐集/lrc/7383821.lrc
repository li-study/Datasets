[00:-2.00]3 Doors Down - It's Not My Time
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:32.25]Looking back at the beginning of this
[00:35.82]And how life was
[00:39.31]Just you and me and love and all of our friends
[00:43.08]Living life like an ocean
[00:46.84]Now the currents slowly pulling me down
[00:50.19]It's getting harder to breath
[00:54.34]It won't be too long and I'll be going under
[00:58.12]Can you save me from this
[00:59.99]It's not my time,
[01:02.34]I'm not going
[01:03.98]There's a fear in me
[01:05.87]It's not showing
[01:07.70]This could be the end of me
[01:10.58]And everything I know
[01:14.53]Oh, I won't go
[01:17.13]
[01:24.55]I look ahead to all the plans that we made
[01:28.04]And the dreams that we had
[01:31.24]I'm in a world that tries to take them away
[01:35.16]Oh, but I'm taking them back
[01:39.39]All this time I've just been to blind to understand
[01:43.46]What should matter to me
[01:46.78]My friend, this life we live
[01:48.38]Is not what we have, it's what we believe
[01:52.51]It's not my time
[01:54.73]I'm not going
[01:56.65]There's a fear in me
[01:58.28]It's not showing
[02:00.28]This could be the end of me
[02:03.14]And everything I know
[02:07.50]Oh, It's not my time
[02:09.35]
[02:09.83]I'm not going
[02:11.47]There's a fear in me
[02:13.35]Now I know that
[02:15.31]This could be the end of me
[02:18.10]And everything I know
[02:21.57]Oh, I won't go
[02:30.47]I won't go
[02:32.16]
[02:39.59]There might be more than you believe
[02:43.43]There might be more than you believe
[02:46.85]There might be something you can't see
[02:52.47]It's not my time
[02:54.59]I'm not going
[02:56.54]There's a fear in me
[02:58.26]It's not showing
[03:00.33]This could be the end of me
[03:03.08]And everything I know
[03:07.53]It's not my time
[03:09.65]I'm not going
[03:11.50]There's a will in me
[03:13.35]Now it's gonna show
[03:15.45]This could be the end of me
[03:18.12]And everything I know
[03:22.63]
[03:24.60]There might be more than you believe
[03:28.35]There might be more than you believe
[03:31.86]There might be more than you can see
[03:36.63]
[03:37.88]I won't go!
