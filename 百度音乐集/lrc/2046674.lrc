[00:48.39]若能表白我心中的依赖
[00:52.56]你我当初也不必那么哀
[00:57.14]若能敝开把真相说出来
[01:01.22]这一段故事不会太精采
[01:05.05]种种意外若能够明白
[01:10.12]那生存意义又何在
[01:13.83]若能推猜这一切的未来
[01:18.60]我干脆辞掉工作买大彩
[01:22.94]because 爱是妒忌 爱是怀疑
[01:27.81]爱是种近乎幻想的真理
[01:31.65]because 爱是游戏 爱能叛逆

[02:50.12]It's like sometimes I don't even know who 
[02:52.22]I am anymore
[02:53.13]Can't see what's the point of being in love anymore
[02:55.76]It's a game what a shame
[02:57.39]You make it lame by going insane about it
[02:59.70]This love ain't what you say about it
[03:01.93]It's about what you do about it
[03:03.46]So get with it, stick with it
[03:05.20]If you still can't understand well, 
[03:07.01]than forget about it
[03:08.14]Sometimes all you do to me is sulk, 
[03:10.06]like you got something to say
[03:11.18]But nothing makes sense when you move your lips
[03:13.24]All you do is get pissed at me
[03:14.77]Dissed at me
[03:15.43]Wonder why you're still here with me
