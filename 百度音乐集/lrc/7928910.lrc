[00:16.84]The first time ever I saw your face
[00:32.32]I thought the sun rose in your eyes
[00:50.25]And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
[01:06.81]To the dark and the empty skies, my love
[01:23.86]
[01:24.88]The first time ever I kissed your mouth
[01:40.38]I felt the earth, moon in my hand
[01:58.26]Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
[02:14.76]That was there at my command, my love
[02:30.95]
[02:31.67]The first time ever I lay with you
[02:48.73]And felt your heart so close to mine
[03:06.62]
[03:15.44]I thought ever I saw your face, your face
[03:40.44]Your face, your face...
