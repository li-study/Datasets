
[00:02.59]Hotel California
[00:10.15]Eagles
[00:16.83]
[00:52.30]On a dark desert highway,
[00:56.10]cool wind in my hair
[00:59.15]Warm smell of colitas,
[01:02.29]rising up through the air
[01:05.46]Up ahead in the distance,
[01:08.89]I saw a shimmering light
[01:11.47]My head grew heavy and
[01:13.13]my sight grew dim
[01:15.41]I had to stop for the night
[01:18.29]There she stood in the doorway;
[01:21.34]I heard the mission bell
[01:24.67]And I was thinking to myself,
[01:27.07]'This could be Heaven or
[01:28.90]this could be Hell'
[01:31.87]Then she lit up a candle
[01:34.35]and she showed me the way
[01:36.81]
[01:38.16]There were voices down the corridor,
[01:41.43]I thought I heard them say...
[01:44.38]Welcome to the Hotel California
[01:49.65]Such a lovely place
[01:52.16]Such a lovely face
[01:53.89]Such a lovely face
[01:57.45]Plenty of room at the Hotel California
[02:03.61]Any time of year, you can find it here
[02:09.69]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,
[02:13.90]she got the Mercedes bends
[02:17.09]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
[02:20.22]that she calls friends
[02:23.49]How they dance in the courtyard,
[02:26.50]sweet summer sweat.
[02:30.19]Some dance to remember,
[02:33.39]some dance to forget
[02:36.76]So I called up the Captain,
[02:39.95]'Please bring me my wine'
[02:42.47]He said,'We haven't had
[02:44.20]that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
[02:49.95]And still those voices are calling
[02:52.22]from far away,
[02:56.33]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[02:59.59]Just to hear them say...
[03:02.60]Welcome to the Hotel California
[03:08.45]Such a lovely place
[03:11.91][03:10.27]Such a lovely face
[03:15.25]They livin' it up at the Hotel California
[03:19.21]
[03:21.52]What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
[03:28.83]Mirrors on the ceiling,
[03:31.27]The pink champagne on ice
[03:34.14]And she said 'We are all
[03:36.17]just prisoners here, of our own device'
[03:41.41]And in the master's chambers,
[03:44.71]They gathered for the feast
[03:48.20]The stab it with their steely knives,
[03:50.76]But they just can't kill the beast
[03:54.43]Last thing I remember, I was
[03:57.70]Running for the door
[04:00.85]I had to find the passage back
[04:03.52]To the place I was before
[04:07.79]'Relax,'said the night man,
[04:10.31]We are programmed to receive.
[04:14.34]You can checkout any time you like,
[04:17.07]but you can never leave
[04:19.70]
