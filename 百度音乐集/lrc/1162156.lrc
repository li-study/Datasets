[00:20.81]You think my shoes are made of leather
[00:24.99]
[00:27.00]But I'm a substitute for another guy
[00:30.71]I look pretty tall but my heels are high
[00:34.42]The simple things you see are all complicated
[00:37.81]I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
[00:42.56]
[00:45.07]Substitute your lies for fact
[00:48.52]I can see right through your plastic mac
[00:51.80]I look all white, but my dad was black
[00:55.24]My fine looking suit is really made out of sack
