Somebody That I Used to Know - Gotye

[00:07.34]Now and then I think of when we were together
[00:20.48]Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
[00:28.21]Told myself that you were right for me
[00:33.73]But felt so lonely in your company
[00:36.82]But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
[00:51.27]But you didn't have to cut me off
[01:04.51]Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing
[01:07.65]And I don't even need your love
[01:14.15]But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough
[01:17.99]You didn't have to stoop so low
[01:22.49]Have your friends collect your records And then change your number
[01:22.57]I guess that I don't need that though
[01:26.28]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[01:32.49]
[01:33.63]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[01:35.74]
[01:39.43]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[01:47.33]
[02:20.01]Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
[02:33.90]But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
[02:40.90]And I don't wanna live that way
[02:47.58]Reading into every word you say
[02:51.28]You said that you could let it go
[02:54.47]And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
[02:57.31]
[03:27.44]But you didn't have to cut me off
[03:32.34]Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing
[03:36.64]And I don't even need your love
[03:39.30]But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough
[03:41.80]You didn't have to stoop so low
[03:46.90]Have your friends collect your records And then change your number
[03:51.37]I guess that I don't need that though
[03:54.07]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[04:11.22]Now you're just somebody that I used to know
