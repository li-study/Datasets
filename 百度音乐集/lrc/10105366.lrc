[00:37.00]It was a story told for years
[00:45.00]When a young girl dwelled this land
[00:49.00]With eyes shone like the star
[00:53.00]And a smile that charmed both heaven and earth
[01:00.00]The moon was ashamed when next to her
[01:07.00]And the flowers bowed their heads
[01:12.00]Her songs could tame the beasts
[01:16.00]Her hands could wave all sorrows away
[02:01.00][01:23.00]Yet that Fate was envy 'bout this girl'
[02:08.00][01:30.00]And a plot was planned to lay her down
[01:38.00]To a pasture she was led
[01:46.00]Where the grass was always green
[01:50.00]In the midst of this wonderland
[01:54.00]Stood the plant that'd bring her permanent end
[02:49.00]The plant of death was in her eyes
[02:56.00]Sending its fragrant through the air
[03:00.00]Laughter form below was heard
[03:07.00]With a touch the task was done
[03:15.00]Like an arrow it speared her heart
[03:19.00]Like venom it killed her light
[03:27.00]As her body slowly dropped
[03:34.00]Stopped the singing from around
[03:38.00]Her soul left without a sound
[04:39.00]The god of love was deeply hurt
[04:47.00]When the tragedy was known
[04:51.00]It cut right into his heart
[04:58.00]With tears and pain he flew to her
[05:05.00]To end this sorrow he drawn his sword
[05:10.00]How red the blood that sprayed around
[05:17.00]As the thorns grew around it stem
[05:24.00]And the petals stained in red
[05:29.00]Turned the plant into a rose
[05:53.00]
[06:01.00]BEYOND再见理想
