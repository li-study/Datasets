[00:00.00]Before you slip into unconsciousness
[00:08.00]I'd like to have another kiss
[00:14.00]Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss
[00:26.50]Another kiss
[00:38.80]The days are bright and filled with pain
[00:44.00]Enclose me in your gentle rain
[00:50.00]The time you ran was too insane
[01:00.00]We'll meet again
[01:02.50]We'll meet again
[01:30.00]Oh tell me where your freedom lies
[01:35.50]The streets are fields that never die
[01:41.00]Deliver me from reasons why
[01:50.00]You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly
[01:59.70]The crystal ship is being filled
[02:05.00]A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
[02:10.00]A million ways to spend your time
[02:20.00]When we get back, I'll drop a line
