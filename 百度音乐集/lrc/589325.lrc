[00:01.12]Neil Diamond - Love Song
[00:05.89]
[00:25.03]The words I have to say
[00:28.39]May well be simple but they’re true
[00:36.40]Until you give your love
[00:40.32]There’s nothing more that we can do
[00:43.84]
[00:49.78]Love is the opening door
[00:55.71]Love is what we came here for
[01:01.63]No one could offer you more
[01:07.18]Do you know what I mean
[01:13.12]Have your eyes really seen
[01:16.56]
[01:21.43]You say it’s very hard
[01:24.79]To leave behind the life we knew
[01:33.52]But there’s no other way
[01:36.58]And now it’s really up to you
[01:39.99]
[02:42.37][01:46.18]Love is the key we must turn
[02:48.30][01:52.02]Truth is the flame we must burn
[02:54.15][01:57.80]Freedom the lesson we must learn
[03:23.47][02:59.81][02:03.50]Do you know what I mean
[03:29.47][03:05.53][02:09.42]Have your eyes really seen
[03:36.36][03:12.46][02:15.85]
