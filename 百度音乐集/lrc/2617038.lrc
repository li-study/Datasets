[ti:Wish I Could fly]
[ar:Roxette]

[00:32.65]Half way through the night,
[00:38.52]I wake up in a dream.
[00:44.49]Echoes in my head,
[00:49.34]Make every whisper turn into a scream.
[00:55.74]I dreamed I could fly.
[00:58.80]Out in the blue,
[01:02.18]Over this town,
[01:04.96]Following you.
[01:08.10]Over the trees,
[01:10.90]Subway and cars.
[01:13.71]I'd try to find out who you really are.
[01:20.30]In the middle of the night.
[01:25.33]Cool sweating in my bed.
[01:31.59]Got the windows open wide.
[01:37.08]Thinking about all the things you said.
[04:08.68][01:43.79]I wish I could fly.
[01:46.85]Out in the blue,
[01:49.79]Over this town,
[01:52.73]Following you.
[01:55.53]I'd fly over rooftops,
[01:58.84]The great boulevards.
[02:01.42]To try to find out who you really are.
[03:28.79][02:07.30]Who you really are?
[02:12.89]I wish I could fly now.
[02:18.88]I wish I could fly now.
[02:25.28]I wish I could fly now.
[03:44.07][03:02.00]I wish I could fly.
[03:05.06]Around and around.
[03:08.08]Over this town,
[03:10.91]The dirt on the ground.
[03:13.85]I'd follow your course of doors left ajar.
[03:19.77]To try to find out who you really are.
[03:36.69]Fly, fly, fly.
