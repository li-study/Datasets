[00:15.01]Why do birds suddenly appear
[00:22.45]Every time you are near
[00:29.29]Just like me, they long to be
[00:35.48]Close to you
[00:38.64]
[00:40.43]Why do stars fall down from the sky
[00:47.95]Every time you walk by
[00:54.81]Just like me, they long to be
[01:01.09]Close to you
[01:04.54]
[01:07.65]On the day that you were born
[01:10.87]And the angels got to gether
[01:13.63]And decided to create a dream come true
[01:19.58]So they sprinkled moon dust
[01:22.32]In your hair of gold
[01:24.47]And starlight in your eyes of blue
[01:30.09]
[01:31.70]That is why all the girls in town
[01:39.16]Follow you all around
[01:45.95]Just like me, they long to be
[01:52.33]Close to you
[01:55.55]
[02:24.55]On the day that you were born
[02:27.65]And the angels got to gether
[02:30.40]And decided to create a dream come true
[02:36.38]So they sprinkled moon dust
[02:38.96]In your hair of gold
[02:41.14]And starlight in your eyes of blue
[02:47.50]
[02:48.54]That is why all the girls in town
[02:55.94]Follow you all around
[03:02.86]Just like me, they long to be
[03:09.32]Close to you
[03:15.70]Just like me, they long to be
[03:23.54]Close to you
