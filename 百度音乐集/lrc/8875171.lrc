[00:00.36]sitting on the dock of the bay
[00:09.00]
[00:10.32]Sittin in the morning sun
[00:14.35]I`ll be sittin\' when the evening comes
[00:21.14]Watching the ships roll in
[00:25.96]And I\'ll watch \'em roll away again
[00:32.11]I\'m just sittin\' on the dock of the bay
[00:36.62]Watching the time roll away
[00:42.62]Sittin\' on the dock of the bay
[00:46.83]Wasting time.
[00:53.61]I left my home in Georgia
[00:58.79]And I headed for the Frisco bay
[01:04.64]I\'ve got nothing to live for
[01:09.05]Look like nothings gonna come my way
[01:14.49]I\'m just sittin\' on the dock of the bay
[01:19.53]Watching the time roll away
[01:25.64]Sittin\' on the dock of the bay Wasting time
[01:37.67]Look like nothings gonna change
[01:42.91]Everthing seems to stay the same
[01:48.21]I can\'t do what ten people tell me to do
[01:53.76]So I guess I\'ll just remain the same
[03:30.52]Sittin\' here resting my bones
[03:39.37]Cause this loneliness won\'t leave me alone
[03:41.03]10000 miles from home
[03:42.00]Just to make this dock my home
[03:43.44]So I\'m just sittin\' on the dock of the bay
[03:44.96]Watching the time roll away, ooh
[03:46.03]Sittin on the dock of the bay Wastin\' time
