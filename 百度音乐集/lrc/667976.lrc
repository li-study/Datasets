[00:19.77]You named me judge the day that I was born
[00:27.81]You asked too much to fix what you had torn
[00:36.50]Things got out of hand,
[00:43.13]now I understand
[00:48.37]And I'm out of your range
[00:50.43]Now it's kind of strange
[00:52.26]
[00:54.90]You were kind of a moon outside of my room
[00:57.89]I could just feel you nearby
[01:00.73]Now I feel you gone
[01:06.67]'Cause I know which side you're on
[01:11.91]And it's not mine
[01:19.36]I walk the line     between now and then
[01:30.87]It's deep-sea diving    with no oxygen
[01:40.53]Guess I went somewhere to hide
[01:46.98]Far behind my eyes
[01:52.76]I willed you there to see
[01:58.48]But you never came for me
[02:03.35]Now I'm out of your range
[02:04.90]Now it's kind of strange
[02:06.44]How we change orbit in our lives
[02:09.23]You were kind of a moon outside of my room
[02:12.05]I could just feel you nearby
[02:15.87]Now I feel you gone
[02:21.27]'Cause I know which side you're on
[02:26.34]And it's not mine
[02:30.97]And it's not mine
[02:37.51]And it's not mine
[02:41.60]
