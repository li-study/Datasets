[00:00.66]Julian Casablacas - Tourist
[00:01.50]
[00:36.30]I wish that clouds could hold me up
[00:41.50]Like I thought as a child growing up.
[00:48.92]I wish I could sound as soothing as the rainfall
[00:54.91]But I am only a drop from the storm.
[01:02.77]
[01:05.22]I feel like a tourist, out in the country.
[01:12.79]Once this small world was all countryside.
[01:21.35]Feel like a tourist in the big city.
[01:29.20]Soon I will simply evaporate.
[01:35.62]
[01:46.74]I took the strings up north.
[01:49.97]The drums down south.
[01:52.84]I take it across to Afghanistan,
[01:56.63]A long time ago.
[01:59.65]Shuffling your feet into the next dimension.
[02:06.29]Soon skyscrapers will be everywhere.
[02:13.76]
[02:15.83]I feel like a tourist lost in the suburbs.
[02:23.89]Soon the whole world will be urban sprawl.
[02:32.06]Feel like a lover out on the ocean.
[02:39.36]Feel like a tear drop streamin' off your chin.
[02:48.95]
[03:32.66]Some will bet against you, try even to prevent you.
[03:38.71]But not many can stop you, man, if you got a perfect plan.
[03:45.64]Can they possibly try or demand to know why they would doubt you?
[03:52.13]In this sand... a thousand generations.
[03:58.97]
[03:59.35]Feel like a tourist out in the desert.
[04:06.36]So hot it feels like the Devil's breath.
[04:14.55]Feel like a tourist out in the swampland.
[04:22.37]This world is just patches of water and land.
[04:30.99]Everywhere I go I'm a tourist,
[04:38.02]But if you stay with me I'll always be at home.
