[00:08.36]T-R-Y
[00:12.91]hey yo
[00:13.66]oh baby we can fight like dogs we can fight like cats
[00:17.04]a dirty laundry needs a laundry man
[00:18.98]maybe the king and the queen should lay off the caffeine
[00:21.83]baby breathe before you react
[00:24.56]sometimes we do forget to behave and we regret what we say
[00:28.24]cause we have two weapons if we don't choose'em carefully
[00:31.07]ladies and gentlemen this is instrumental
[00:33.48]if life's to be a bed of roses
[00:35.99]i know i gave you everything you like
[00:41.59]because you still give me butterflies
[00:47.07]if we just try try try
[00:49.62]just to be ni-ni-nice
[00:52.92]then the world would be a better place for you and I
[00:58.35]if we just live our lives
[01:00.97]putting our differences aside
[01:04.22]oh that would be so beautiful to me
[01:07.88]
[01:09.48]are we just dangling in the middle of a galaxy
[01:13.40]well i'm stoked on gravity
[01:15.48]to be stuck with you like flowers on the dew drops
[01:18.56]now let it in my direction
[01:21.00]my direction is up when everybody's down
[01:24.09]cause i don't mind being anybody's clown
[01:27.05]i love a little lift cause i'm an optimistic
[01:30.33]in an altruistic way
[01:32.88]cause basically this place is needing instruments of harmony
[01:38.32]spreading my philosophy of love and inspiration
[01:43.98]oh these words i speak i committ to like a crime
[01:49.54]with a rythme i deliver i'm giving'em a picture of the reasons why
[01:53.01]
[01:54.62]we should just try try try
[01:57.41]just to be ni-ni-nice
[02:00.51]so the world could be a better place for you and i
[02:05.96]if we just live our lives
[02:08.62]putting our differences aside
[02:11.96]oh that would be so beautiful to me
[02:16.17]
[02:17.62]well it wouldn't cost a penny but could save so many lonely lives
[02:22.84]from teary eyes
[02:25.85]if we just try try try
[02:29.14]to open up a can of understanding open up your heart
[02:33.64]i'm just planting seeds
[02:36.89]cause i believe

[02:42.60]just to be ni-ni-nice
[02:45.85]so the world would be a better place for you and i
[02:51.02]if we just live our lives
[02:54.06]putting our differences aside
