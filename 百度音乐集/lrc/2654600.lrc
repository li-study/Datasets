[00:01.54]Right Here Waiting
[00:03.98]Richard Marx
[00:05.60]
[00:45.00]Oceans apart day after day
[00:50.77]And I slowly go insane
[00:56.15]I hear your voice on the line
[01:01.94]But it doesn't stop the pain
[01:07.00]If I see you next to never
[01:11.63]How can we say forever
[01:17.30]Wherever you go
[01:20.20]Whatever you do
[01:22.70]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:28.20]Whatever it takes
[01:30.91]Or how my heart breaks
[01:33.38]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:38.92]
[01:44.22]I took for granted all the times
[01:50.78]That I though would last somehow
[01:55.55]I hear the laughter I taste the tears
[02:01.43]But I can't get near you now
[02:06.31]Oh can't you see it baby
[02:11.03]You've got me goin' crazy
[02:16.19]Wherever you go
[02:19.34]Whatever you do
[02:21.82]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:27.33]Whatever it takes
[02:30.03]Or how my heart breaks
[02:32.56]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:38.83]I wonder how we can survive
[02:44.32]This romance
[02:46.83]
[02:48.85]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:54.10]I'll take the chance
[02:59.08]
[03:20.63]Oh can't you see it baby
[03:26.36]You've got me goin' crazy
[03:31.51]Wherever you go
[03:34.79]Whatever you do
[03:37.15]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:42.81]Whatever it takes
[03:45.47]Or how my heart breaks
[03:48.23]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:54.17]
[04:01.68]waiting for you
[04:04.68]
