[00:00.00]
[00:22.00]If time was still
[00:24.82]The sun would never never find us
[00:30.65]We could light up
[00:34.66]The sky tonight
[00:37.75]I would see the world through your eyes
[00:43.30]Leave it all behind
[00:46.89]
[00:47.45]If it's you & me forever
[00:50.30]If it's you & me right now that'd be alright
[00:55.97]Be alright
[01:00.01]We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
[01:03.80]Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
[01:08.72]So won't you fly with me

[01:21.50]
[01:26.09]Now the past
[01:29.06]Can come alive and give it meaning
[01:34.86]And a reason
[01:38.38]To give all I can
[01:44.64]To believe once again
[01:49.67]
[01:51.44]If it's you & me forever
[01:54.44]If it's you & me right now that'd be alright
[02:00.60]Be alright
[02:04.07]We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
[02:07.84]Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
[02:12.77]So won't you fly with me
[02:18.30]Maybe you were just afraid
[02:21.38]Knowing you were miles away
[02:24.51]From the place where you needed to be
[02:29.20]And that's right here with me
[02:32.40]
[02:34.68]It's you & me forever
[02:37.82]You & me right now that'd be alright
[02:42.76]
[02:47.32]We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
[02:51.00]Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
[02:56.04]So won't you fly with me
[03:02.45]
[03:13.05]If it's you & me forever
[03:15.90]If it's you & me right now I'd be alright
[03:22.07]Be alright
[03:25.75]We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
[03:29.41]Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
[03:34.29]So won't you fly
[03:38.85]Fly
