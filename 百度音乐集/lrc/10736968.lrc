[00:12.01]I can't remember what I planned tomorrow
[00:16.61]I can't remember when it's time to go
[00:21.43]When I look in the mirror
[00:24.35]Tracing lines with a pencil
[00:28.29]I remember what came before
[00:33.22]I wanted to think there was endless love
[00:38.37]Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
[00:43.35]In the dead of the night I found out
[00:49.75]Sometimes there's love that won't survive
[00:54.85]New York City
[00:58.09]Such a beautiful disease
[01:03.12]New York City
[01:08.89]Such a beautiful,
[01:14.29]Such a beautiful disease
[01:26.94]Laura kept all her disappointments
[01:32.33]Locked up in a box behind her closed door
[01:37.65]She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder
[01:43.98]With no way out from the family store
[01:48.52]We all told her things could get better
[01:53.93]When you just say goodbye
[01:59.13]I'll lay awake one more night
[02:05.26]Caught in a vision I want to deny
[02:10.46]And did I mention the note that I found
[02:15.33]Taped to my locked front door
[02:20.43]It talked about no regrets
[02:25.40]As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor
[02:28.40]I rode the train for hours on end
[02:36.77]And watched the people pass me by
[02:41.90]It could be that it has no end
[02:46.75]Just an action junkie's lullaby
[02:53.61]New York City
[02:56.00]Such a beautiful disease
[03:04.21]New York City
[03:06.87]Such a beautiful,
[03:12.48]Such a beautiful disease
[03:24.34]We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
[03:29.97]As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
[03:35.65]Caught up in the whole illusion
[03:41.41]That dreams never pass us by
[03:46.71]Came to a tattooed conclusion
[03:50.93]That the big one was knocking on the door
[03:56.90]What started as a mass delusion
[04:02.46]Would take me far from the place I adore
[04:08.36]New York City
[04:10.55]Such a beautiful disease
[04:18.19]New York City
[04:21.27]You are my beautiful
[04:27.15]Such a beautiful disease
