[00:01.07]Held your standards close to heart
[00:08.07]But late one night you threw them down
[00:16.24]Simple promises you said you'd never break
[00:35.02]But now you have
[00:38.86]
[00:44.71]All throughout the morning though
[00:52.07]I'm begging no
[00:57.04]Your lips they stay perfectly still
[01:05.08]

[02:40.04]I swear but no
[02:45.11]Your lips they stay perfectly still
[02:52.91]
[03:07.00]Still... still... still...
