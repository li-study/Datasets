[00:02.13]Bob Dylan - All Along The Watchtower
[00:13.16]
[00:15.91]\"There must be some way out of here,\"
[00:19.32]said the joker to the thief,
[00:22.73]\"There's too much confusion,
[00:25.93]I can't get no relief.
[00:30.00]Businessmen, they drink my wine,
[00:34.58]plowmen dig my earth,
[00:38.23]None of them along the line
[00:41.72]know what any of it is worth.\"
[00:44.97]
[01:00.20]\"No reason to get excited,\"
[01:03.97]the thief, he kindly spoke,
[01:07.43]\"There are many here among us
[01:11.23]who feel that life is but a joke.
[01:15.07]But you and I, we've been through that
[01:18.87]and this is not our fate,
[01:22.59]So let us not talk falsely now,
[01:26.35]the hour is getting late.\"
[01:29.33]
[01:44.68]All along the watchtower,
[01:48.13]princes kept the view
[01:51.96]While all the women came and went,
[01:55.96]barefoot servants, too.
[01:59.20]Outside in the distance
[02:02.86]a wildcat did growl,
[02:06.89]Two riders were approaching,
[02:10.66]the wind began to howl.
