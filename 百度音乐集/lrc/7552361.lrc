[00:01.27]White Room
[00:03.43]
[00:05.49]Eric Clapton
[00:07.49]
[00:23.40]In the white room with black curtains near the station.
[00:32.15]Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
[00:40.58]Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
[00:49.69]Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment.
[00:56.91]
[00:58.87]I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
[01:07.46]Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.
[01:17.60]
[01:19.63]You said no strings could secure you at the station.
[01:28.60]Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
[01:37.28]I walked into such a sad time at the station.
[01:46.02]As i walked out, felt my own need just beginning.
[01:52.33]
[01:54.95]I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
[02:03.80]Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.
[02:14.76]
[02:37.69]At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
[02:46.54]Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
[02:55.23]Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
[03:04.12]She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.
[03:11.27]
[03:13.35]I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
[03:21.98]Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.
