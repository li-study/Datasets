[03:34.28][03:12.70][02:42.85][02:22.53][01:21.33][00:20.08]If you had my love
[03:36.50][03:15.56][02:45.07][02:24.61][01:23.28][00:22.19]And I gave you all my trust
[03:38.59][03:17.97][02:47.61][02:27.09][01:25.88][00:24.61]Would you comfort me
[03:20.82][02:51.93][01:28.82]Tell me,Baby
[03:23.66][02:53.03][02:32.70][01:31.36][00:30.04]And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
[03:28.29][02:57.57][02:37.19][01:35.95][00:34.76]Would you lie to me
[03:31.12][03:00.41][02:40.11][01:38.58][00:37.32]And call me baby
[03:45.26][03:06.36][00:14.30]
[00:39.80]Now if I gave you me, this is how it's got to be
[00:44.20]First of all I won't take you cheatin' on me
[00:50.05]Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you
[00:54.53]And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
[01:00.43]You said that we could possibly spend eternity
[01:08.50]See that's what you told me (that's what you said)
[01:11.24]But if you want me
[01:13.39]You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
[01:18.47](If you really want me babe)
[01:41.12]Said you want my love and you've got to have it all
[01:45.55]But first there are some things you need to know
[01:51.24]If you want to live
[01:53.13]With all I have to give
[01:55.68]I need to feel true love
[01:57.90]Or it's got to end, yeah
[02:01.50]I don't want you
[02:03.55]Trying to get with me
[02:06.26]And I end up unhappy
[02:09.47](Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain)
[02:12.25]So before I do
[02:13.91]Give myself to you
[02:16.36]I have to know the truth
[02:19.91](If I spend my life with you)
