[00:01.90]Steve Perry - She's Mine
[00:17.60]
[00:30.26]I've seen your kind before
[00:35.42]I've seen you creepin' around
[00:40.27]Before you come 'round my door
[00:44.47]Oh, there's one thing you got to know
[00:49.09]She's mine, all mine
[00:55.17]Don't show your face here no more
[00:58.89]She's mine, all mine
[01:04.76]Don't hang around here no more
[01:09.18]
[01:12.12]I heard her call out your name
[01:17.02]Late last night in her sleep
[01:21.92]That's why I came here to say
[01:26.16]No, it won't be easy to steal her away
[01:30.82]She's mine, all mine
[01:36.61]Don't show your face here no more
[01:40.52]She's mine, all mine
[01:46.32]Don't hang around here no more
[02:07.25]Go
[02:10.37]
[02:30.39]You've got her under your spell
[02:36.08]And she's believin' your lies
[02:40.85]You'd like her at your hotel, oh
[02:45.00]No, not as long as I'm alive
[02:49.45]She's mine, all mine
[02:55.32]Don't show your face here no more
[02:59.19]She's mine, all mine
[03:04.94]Don't hang around here no more, more, more, more
[03:10.21]Oh, she's mine
[03:14.62]Don't show your face here no more
[03:20.74]No, no, no, no
[03:24.05]Don't hang around
[03:25.33]Don't hang
[03:26.36]Don't hang around no more
