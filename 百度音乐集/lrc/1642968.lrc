[00:00.00]U2 - Bullet the Blue Sky
[00:15.00]From The Joshua Tree
[00:30.00]
[00:45.53]In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
[00:51.68]See it driving nails
[00:53.92]Into the souls on the tree of pain
[00:57.65]From the firefly, a red orange glow
[01:03.98]See the face of fear
[01:05.94]Running scared in the valley below
[01:09.83]
[01:15.42]Bullet the blue sky
[01:18.41]Bullet the blue sky
[01:21.77]Bullet the blue
[01:24.96]Bullet the blue
[01:28.15]
[01:32.84]In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
[01:38.84]Jacob wrestled the angel
[01:40.75]And the angel was overcome
[01:45.12]You plant a demon seed
[01:48.13]You raise a flower of fire
[01:51.33]See them burning crosses
[01:54.06]See the flames higher and higher
[01:57.50]
[02:02.82]Bullet the blue sky
[02:05.98]Bullet the blue sky
[02:09.11]Bullet the blue
[02:12.31]Bullet the blue
[02:16.15]
[02:29.68]This guy comes up to me
[02:31.53]His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
[02:34.67]Like all the colors of a royal flush
[02:37.31]And he's peeling off those dollar bills
[02:40.15]Slapping them down
[02:41.65]One hundred, two hundred
[02:45.05]And I can see those fighter planes
[02:48.30]And I can see those fighter planes
[02:51.50]Across the mud huts where the children sleep
[02:54.77]Through the alleys of a quiet city street
[02:57.89]You take the staircase to the first floor
[03:00.86]Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
[03:04.12]As a man breathes into a saxophone
[03:07.29]And through the walls you hear the city groan
[03:10.46]Outside is America
[03:13.57]Outside is America
[03:17.16]
[04:14.47]Across the field you see the sky ripped open
[04:18.36]See the rain through a gaping wound
[04:22.50]Pounding on the women and children
[04:25.26]Who run
[04:27.07]Into the arms
[04:28.80]Of America
[04:30.00]End
