[00:02.00]30 Seconds to Mars - Night Of The Hunter
[00:05.00]
[00:32.58]I was born of the womb of a poisonous spell
[00:37.55]Beaten and broken and chased from the lair
[00:41.66]But I rise up above it, high up above it and see
[00:49.67]I was hung from the tree made of tongues of the weak
[00:54.06]The branches were bones of liars and thieves
[02:21.10][00:58.24]Rise up above it, high up above and see
[02:28.39][01:05.39]Pray to your god, open your heart
[02:32.66][01:09.97]Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
[02:36.69][01:13.96]Cover your eyes, the devil inside
[04:32.59][02:41.34][01:18.21]One night of the hunter
[04:36.97][02:45.53][01:22.95]One day I will get revenge
[04:41.84][02:49.63][01:27.23]One night to remember
[04:45.61][02:53.87][01:31.06]One day it'll all just end
[01:55.32]Blessed by a bitch from a bastard's seed
[02:00.50]Pleasure to meet you but prepare to bleed
[02:04.58]Rise, I'll rise, I'll rise
[02:12.52]Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
[02:16.88]Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
[03:56.05][03:48.28][03:39.62][03:30.59]Honest to God I'll break your heart
[04:00.16][03:51.98][03:43.74][03:35.86]Tear you to pieces and rip you apart
