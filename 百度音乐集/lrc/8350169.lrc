[00:25.40]I'm not alone, I wish I was
[00:31.48]'Cause then I'd know I was down because
[00:37.77]I couldn't find a friend around
[00:43.90]To love me like they do right now
[00:50.39]They do right now
[00:52.96]
[01:03.11]I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
[01:09.12]I searched for joy but I bought it all
[01:15.42]It doesn't help the hunger pains
[01:21.66]And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
[01:27.53]
[01:29.45]Something's missing
[01:35.68]And I don't know how to fix it
[01:42.16]Something's missing
[01:47.11]And I don't know what it is
[01:50.13]No I don't know what it is
[01:53.31]At all
[01:55.13]
[02:05.96]When Autumn comes, it doesn't ask
[02:12.06]It just walks in where it left you last
[02:18.25]You never know when it starts
[02:24.57]Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
[02:30.57]
[02:31.90]Something's missing
[02:38.52]And I don't know how to fix it
[02:45.05]Something's missing
[02:49.99]And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is
[02:56.25]At all
[02:58.10]
[03:03.74]I can't be sure that this state of mind
[03:07.89]Is not of my own design
[03:15.77]I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness
[03:24.40]For loneliness like this
[03:30.38]
[03:41.20]Something's missing
[03:47.69]And I don't know how to fix it
[03:54.15]Something's missing
[03:59.18]And I don't know what it is
[04:02.08]No I don't know what it is
[04:05.21]Something's different
[04:11.70]And I don't know what it is
[04:14.67]No I don't know what it is
[04:18.05]
[04:18.57]Friends - check
[04:21.72]Money - check
[04:24.13]Well-slept - check
[04:27.15]Opposite sex - check
[04:30.57]Guitar - check
[04:33.72]Microphone - check
[04:36.85]Messages waiting on me when I come home - check
[04:42.43]
[04:43.13]How come everything I think I need
[04:46.85]Always comes with batteries?
[04:52.00]What do you think it means?
[04:55.52]How come everything I think I need...
