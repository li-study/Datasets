[00:14.08]I only slept for a couple of hours
[00:19.46]In the back of my buddy's truck
[00:24.40]I must be runnin' on solar power
[00:29.66]'Cause I'm ready to crank back up
[00:32.18]
[00:34.07]And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
[00:36.85]And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
[00:39.41]And that big ball's way up in the sky
[00:44.78]My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
[00:47.51]So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
[00:50.40]Hey, it's so good to be alive
[00:55.15]Swimmin' in sunshine
[01:00.44]Swimmin' in sunshine
[01:05.32]
[01:07.46]There's a hole in my beach towel
[01:12.75]There's a hole in the atmosphere
[01:17.65]But we got the shade of the lifeguard tower
[01:23.40]Yeah, that's where we keep the beer
[01:25.60]
[01:27.43]And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
[01:30.09]And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
[01:32.80]And that big ball's way up in the sky
[01:38.14]My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
