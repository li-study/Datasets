[00:01.06]I've been defeated and brought down
[00:33.73]Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
[00:42.69]The time has come to change my ways
[00:55.10]
[00:56.00]On this day i see clearly, everything has come to life
[01:04.17]A bitter place and a broken dream
[01:09.14]And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind
[01:18.24]I'll never long for what might have been
[01:29.70]Regret won't waste my life again
[01:37.73]I won't look back. I'll fight to remain
[01:45.53]On this day, I see clearly, everything has come to life
[02:00.85]A bitter place and a broken dream
[02:05.85]And we'll leave it all behind
[02:09.92]On this day, its so real to me
[02:14.35]Everything has come to life
[02:18.24]Another chance to chase a dream
[02:23.04]Another chace to feel chance to feel alive
[02:37.48]Fear will kill me, all I could be lift these sorrows
[02:58.77]Let me breathe, could you set me free
[03:10.85]Could you set me free
[03:20.33]On this day, I see clearly, everything has come to life
[03:29.55]A bitter place and a broken dream
[03:34.23]And we'll leave it all behind
[03:38.41]On this day, it so real to me
[03:43.00]Everything has come to life
[03:47.14]Another chance to chase a dream
[03:52.06]Another chance to feel chance to feel alive

[04:00.93]To my friends:
