[00:00.00]Sad Song
[00:01.80]Lenka
[00:02.86]
[00:15.67]Don't tell me you wanna be
[00:17.37]The kind of girl who's drowning
[00:21.00]
[00:22.64]And don't be holding on to anything
[00:24.96]That's gonna keep you frowning darling
[00:30.12]Everyone's compelled to look into the mirror
[00:32.88]When they're crying
[00:35.01]
[00:36.93]Just because your tears are pretty
[00:39.31]Doesn't mean they'll get you by
[00:42.13]
[00:43.82]Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
[00:49.68]Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
[00:57.03]Because everything feels like
[01:00.56]it's going around in circles
[01:04.17]And everyone knows that the world is upside down
[01:11.13]
[01:13.44]You were once a little baby
[01:15.21]Full of optimistic wonder
[01:18.61]
[01:20.52]So what got into you to make you think
[01:22.73]That it could pull you under  honey
[01:27.42]Could it be that we were under
[01:29.72]The impression life was perfect
[01:33.55]
[01:35.18]And when the bubble burst
[01:36.42]We understood that every part of it hurts
[01:39.75]
[01:41.56]Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
[01:47.29]Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
[01:54.66]Because everything feels like
[01:58.40]it's going around in circles
[02:02.51]And everyone knows that the world is upside down
[02:08.65]
[02:25.11]I'm going to color my glasses rose
[02:32.69]I'm going to follow where the rainbow goes
[02:39.43]And my pot of gold will be waiting
[02:44.95]
[02:46.46]Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
[02:52.50]Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
[02:59.48]Because everything feels like
[03:03.01]it's going around in circles
[03:07.89]And everyone knows that the world is upside down
[03:13.78]
[03:15.86]And everyone knows that the world is upside down
[03:21.61]
