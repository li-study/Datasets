[00:03.34]Good Charlotte
[00:05.05]
[00:06.06]Something isn't right
[00:08.51]I can feel it again, feel it again
[00:11.64]This isn't the first time
[00:14.01]That you left me waiting
[00:17.37]Sad excuses and false hopes high
[00:22.76]I saw this coming
[00:25.16]Still I don't know why I let you in
[00:29.40]
[00:30.05]I knew it all along
[00:32.96]It's so predictable
[00:35.48]I knew something would go wrong
[00:37.31](somethings always wrong)
[00:41.45]So you don't have to call or say anything at all
[00:47.20]It's so predictable(so predictable)
[00:51.87]
[00:57.02]So take your empty words, your broken promises
[01:02.67]And all the time you stole
[01:04.76]Cause I am done with this
[01:08.16]I could give it away, give it away
[01:10.98]I'm doing everything I should've
[01:13.81]And now I'm making a change, I'm living the day
[01:16.55]I'm giving back what you gave me
[01:19.06]I don't need anything
[01:21.18]I knew it all along
[01:23.98]It's so predictable
[01:26.53]I knew something would go wrong
[01:28.62](somethings always wrong)
[01:32.59]So you don't have to call or say anything at all
[01:37.98]It's so predictable(so predictable)
[01:42.72]Everywhere I go, everyone I meet
[01:44.70]Everytime I try to fall in love
[01:46.36]They're all gunna wanna know why I'm so fucked up
[01:48.36]Why am I so cold?
[01:49.68]Why I'm so hard inside
[01:51.17]Why am I scared, what am I afraid of?
[01:53.81]I don't even know!
[01:54.89]This story's never had an end
[01:56.41]I've been waiting
[01:57.09]I've been searching
[01:57.90]I've been hoping
[01:58.73]I've been dreaming you would come back
[02:00.55]But I know the ending of this story
[02:02.16]And you're never coming back...never!
[02:10.58]
[02:18.11]I knew it all along
[02:20.93]It's so predictable
[02:23.21]I knew something would go wrong
[02:25.34](somethings always wrong)
[02:29.48]So you don't have to call or say anything at all
[02:34.98]It's so predictable(so predictable)
[02:39.51]Everywhere I go for the rest of my life
[02:42.22]Everyone I love
[02:43.61]Everyone I care about(so predictable)
[02:45.25]They're all gunna wanna know what's wrong with me
[02:47.40]And I know what it is
[02:48.96]And I'm ending this right now.(so predictable)
