[00:01.17]Some kind of light
[00:03.89]at the end
[00:06.78]I'm touching
[00:07.26]the edge of her skin
[00:10.04]
[00:11.51]能把pop推嚮無底的深淵的力量
[00:13.82]
[00:16.27]rock'n'roll
[00:18.07]
[00:29.32]Once so hard to speak
[00:31.94]Now so easy to play around
[00:34.63]Catching your eye you know
[00:39.06]That eye that slapped you in your face
[00:42.34]and called you a puppy
[00:44.16]Well how do you say
[00:45.58]I was hypnotized
[00:48.23]Hypnotized
[00:50.02]
[00:50.38]My words, they pour
[00:52.95]Like children to the playground
[00:55.67]Children to the playground
[00:58.72]You make me smile
[01:01.26]
[01:01.75]There's some kind of light at the end
[01:04.17]Stoned, forgetful, and then
[01:06.92]I'm drinking what used to be sin
[01:08.97]And touching the edge of her skin
[01:11.54]
[01:22.32]And could you be the one that's not afraid
[01:25.04]To look me in the eyes
[01:31.27]I swear I would collapse
[01:34.30]If I would tell how I think you fell
[01:37.13]From the sky
[01:41.18]
[01:42.02]Yeah my words, they pour
[01:44.43]Like children to the playground
[01:47.54]Children to the playground
[01:50.24]You make me smile
[01:52.96]
[01:53.26]There's some kind of light at the end
[01:55.91]Stoned, forgetful, and then
[01:58.52]I'm drinking what used to be sin
[02:00.68]And touching the edge of her skin
[02:03.22]
[02:03.56]There's some kind of light at the end
[02:06.04]Stoned, forgetful, and then
[02:08.65]I'm drinking what used to be sin
[02:10.92]And touching the edge of her skin
[02:13.43]
[02:15.76]It's the feeling I get
[02:17.51]My palms with sweat
[02:18.63]Like some kind of daydream
[02:20.10]I'll never forget
[02:21.05]I'm stuck in this spin
[02:22.26]Why does it begin
[02:23.97]By touching the edge of her skin
[02:34.47]
[02:36.45]There's some kind of light at the end
[02:38.79]Stoned, forgetful, and then
[02:41.30]I'm drinking what used to be sin
[02:43.35]And touching the edge of her skin
[02:45.65]
[02:46.35]There's some kind of light at the end
[02:49.09]Stoned, forgetful, and then
[02:51.58]I'm drinking what used to be sin
[02:53.84]And touching the edge of her skin
[03:16.78]
