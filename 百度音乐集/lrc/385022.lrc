[00:12.40]It has never been this quiet and
[00:19.23]we have never seen a storm.
[00:24.23]Though you really made things quiet
[00:30.47]I think I will stay calm.
[00:35.48]Cause' I can't move the slightest finger
[00:41.69]let alone raise my hand.
[00:47.37]I'm sure we lived like lovers
[00:52.27]but you dreamt of becoming a happier man.
[00:58.38]I can't tell what I had chosen.
[01:02.80]If no choices of this kind can be made.
[01:09.46]I was happy for a long time
[01:14.01]but that's not what I feel today.
[01:19.89]
[01:42.09]It has never been this dreamlike
[01:47.75]and we have never seen a ghost.
[01:53.04]Though you are bringing me a nightmare
[01:57.83]it's not what frightens me the most.
[02:03.83]You make me go through my visions
[02:09.43]and what it was that we achieved.
[02:14.83]You make me ransack love for it's goodness
[02:19.47]and if love ever leads to harmony
[02:25.18]if love ever leads to harmony
