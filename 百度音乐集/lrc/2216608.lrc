[00:01.43]One Sweet Love
[00:04.88]Sara Bareilles
[00:10.28]Just about the time the shadows call
[00:15.38]I undress my mind and dare you to follow
[00:20.41]Paint a portrait of my mystery
[00:25.78]Only close my eyes and you are here with me
[00:31.27]A nameless face to think I see
[00:34.02]To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone
[00:40.74]A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is made out of
[00:46.19]My own devices....
[00:48.72]Could I be wrong?
[00:53.11]The time that I've taken
[00:57.50]I pray is not wasted
[01:03.33]Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
[01:15.04]Sleepless nights you creep inside of me
[01:20.30]Paint your shadows on the breath that we share
[01:26.38]You take more than just my sanity
[01:31.06]You take my reason not to care.
[01:36.38]No ordinary wings I'll need
[01:39.34]The sky itself will carry me back to you
[01:44.81]The things I dream that I can do I'll open up
[01:51.37]The moon for you
[01:53.41]Just come down soon
[01:58.42]The time that I've taken
[02:04.17]I pray is not wasted
[02:09.36]Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
[02:19.98]Ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking
[02:30.10]But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of
[02:37.25]One sweet love.
[02:42.65]Savor the sorrow to soften the pain sip on
[02:47.48]The southern rain
[02:49.55]As I do, I don't look don't touch don't do anything
[02:54.71]But hope that there is a you.
[03:01.39]The earth that is the space between,
[03:04.21]I'd banish it from under me...to get to you.
[03:12.17]Your unexpected love provides my solitary's Suicide
[03:17.65]oh I wish I knew
[03:22.61]The time that I've taken
[03:28.44]I pray is not wasted
[03:33.48]Have I already tasted my piece of one sweet love?
[03:43.63]Ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking
[03:55.00]But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of
[04:01.43]One sweet love.
