[00:21.00]If you gave me just a coin for every time we say goodbye
[00:30.14]Well I'd be rich beyond my dreams, I'm sorry for my weary life
[00:40.13]I know I'm not perfect but I can smile
[00:49.43]and I hope that you see this heart behind my tired eyes
[01:00.01]If you tell me that I can't, I will, I will, I'll try all night
[01:09.50]and if I say I'm coming home, I'll probably be out all night
[01:18.86]I know I can be afraid but I'm alive
[01:27.94]and I hope that you can trust this heart behing my tired eyes
[01:38.74]I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try
[01:48.44]I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life
[01:57.15]I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry
[02:06.37]Oh...I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly
[02:37.41]I know I'm not around each night
[02:41.46]and I know I always think I'm right
[02:46.21]I can believe that you might look around
[02:55.29]I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try
[03:05.06]I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life
[03:14.29]I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry
[03:22.86]Oh...I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly
