[00:17.71]goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tite
[00:25.51]may it hold you through the winter of a long night
[00:34.96]and keep you from the loneliness of yourself
[00:46.12]heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
[00:56.36]cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love
[01:00.45]it's unsung, and i say
[01:03.24]goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
[01:16.17]goodnight, always, to all that's in your heart
[01:23.62]
[01:48.14]goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
[01:59.77]head lite with the wishes of a sandman and a night light
[02:03.75]be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight nestled in your covers
[02:13.49]the sun shines but i don't
[02:24.44]a silver rain will wash away
[02:27.80]the sun shines but i don't
[02:34.63]a silver rain will wash away
[02:42.66]and you can tell, it's just as well
[02:50.18]goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
[03:15.87]goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
