[00:06.85]Eagles - Hotel California
[00:34.02]
[02:12.80]On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
[02:19.11]Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
[02:25.39]Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
[02:31.76]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[02:34.93]I had to stop for the night
[02:38.40]There she stood in the doorway;
[02:43.13]I heard the mission bell
[02:46.88]And I was thinking to myself,
[02:47.36]'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
[02:55.06]Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
[02:58.09]There were voices down the corridor,
[03:00.60]I thought I heard them say...
[03:04.67]Welcome to the Hotel California
[03:09.33]Such a lovely place
[03:09.82]Such a lovely face
[03:10.09]Plenty of room at the Hotel California
[03:22.11]Any time of year, you can find it here
[03:29.17]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
[03:34.39]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
[03:40.42]How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
[03:47.68]Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
[03:51.87]So I called up the Captain,
[03:57.98]'Please bring me my wine'
[04:01.11]He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine' And still those voices are calling from far away,
[04:14.02]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[04:18.74]Just to hear them say...
[04:22.64]Welcome to the Hotel California
[04:25.83]Such a lovely place
[04:29.06]Such a lovely face
[04:32.50]They livin' it up at the Hotel California
[04:37.96]What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
[04:45.92]Mirrors on the ceiling,
[04:50.43]The pink champagne on ice
[04:52.71]And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
[04:57.83]And in the master's chambers,
[05:03.04]They gathered for the feast
[05:08.22]The stab it with their steely knives,
[05:11.06]But they just can't kill the beast
[05:14.67]Last thing I remember, I was
[05:17.26]Running for the door
[05:20.06]I had to find the passage back
[05:22.50]To the place I was before
[05:25.81]'Relax,'said the night man,
[05:28.88]We are programmed to receive.
[05:32.67]You can checkout any time you like,
[05:35.56]but you can never leave
