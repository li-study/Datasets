[00:01.00]Honesty
[00:03.00]Billy Joel
[00:06.00]
[00:08.02]If you search for tenderness
[00:11.42]It isn't hard to find
[00:15.01]You can have the love you need to live
[00:22.10]But if you look for truthfulness
[00:24.72]You might just as well be blind
[00:28.71]It always seems to be so hard to give
[00:35.12]
[00:36.06]Honesty is such a lonely word
[00:43.19]Everyone is so untrue
[00:50.42]Honesty is hardly ever heard
[00:57.24]And mostly what I need from you
[01:02.77]
[01:05.03]I can always find someone
[01:08.42]To say they sympathize
[01:12.16]If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
[01:19.15]But I don't want some pretty face
[01:22.08]To tell me pretty lies
[01:25.83]All I want is someone to believe
[01:32.62]
[01:33.09]Honesty is such a lonely word
[01:40.08]Everyone is so untrue
[01:47.27]Honesty is hardly ever heard
[01:54.25]And mostly what I need from you
[01:59.27]
[02:05.50]I can find a lover
[02:09.02]I can find a friend
[02:12.51]I can have security
[02:15.70]Until the bitter end
[02:19.60]Anyone can comfort me
[02:22.23]With promises again
[02:25.15]I know, (I know) I know
[02:30.66]
[02:36.91]When I'm deep inside of me
[02:40.44]Don't be too concerned
[02:43.78]I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
[02:50.77]But when I want sincerity
[02:53.54]Tell me where else can I turn
[02:57.14]Because you're the one that I depend upon
[03:04.22]
[03:05.51]Honesty is such a lonely word
[03:11.10]Everyone is so untrue
[03:18.32]Honesty is hardly ever heard
[03:25.07]And mostly what I need from you
[03:29.81]
