[00:09.56]
[00:10.90]The evening breeze
[00:16.34]caressed the trees Tenderly
[00:23.99]The trembling trees
[00:26.70]embraced the breeze Tenderly
[00:35.06]Then you and I came wandering by
[00:45.36]and lost in a sigh were we.
[00:54.14]
[00:55.11]The shore was kissed
[00:58.20]by sea and mist Tenderly.
[01:05.78]I can't forget
[01:08.76]how two hearts met breathlessly.
[01:17.14]Your arms opened wide
[01:22.57]and closed me inside
[01:27.32]You took my lips
[01:30.48]you took my love so Tenderly.
[01:36.67]
[01:39.16]Your arms opened wide
[01:44.14]and closed me inside
[01:51.24]You took my lips
[01:55.23]you took my love so Tenderly.
