[00:02.45]Luther Vandross-Dance With My Father
[00:07.73]
[00:16.34]Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence
[00:28.26]My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
[00:39.49]Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep
[00:45.43]Then up the stairs he would carry me
[00:49.84]And I knew for sure I was loved
[00:54.78]
[00:56.66]If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
[01:09.04]I’d play a song that would never, ever end
[01:13.73]How I’d love, love, love
[01:17.60]To dance with my father again
[01:32.46]When I and my mother would disagree
[01:38.62]To get my way, I would run from her to him
[01:44.57]He’d make me laugh just to comfort me
[01:50.50]Then finally make me do just what my mama said
[01:56.43]Later that night when I was asleep
[02:01.92]He left a dollar under my sheet
[02:06.96]Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
[02:13.69]If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him
[02:26.09]I’d play a song that would never, ever end
[02:30.50]‘Cause I’d love, love, love
[02:34.57]To dance with my father again
[02:41.03]Sometimes I’d listen outside her door
[02:46.52]And I’d hear how my mother cried for him
[02:52.68]I pray for her even more than me
[02:58.81]I pray for her even more than me
[03:18.90]I know I’m praying for much too much
[03:24.86]But could you send back the only man she loved
[03:31.16]I know you don’t do it usually
[03:35.76]But dear Lord she’s dying
[03:39.73]To dance with my father again
[03:48.82]Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
