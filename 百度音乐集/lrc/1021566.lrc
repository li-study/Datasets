[00:00.23]Poets often use many words
[00:06.63]To say a simple thing
[00:12.87]It takes thought and time and rhyme
[00:18.36]To make a poem sing
[00:24.11]With music and words I've been playing
[00:30.20]For you I have written a song
[00:36.14]To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
[00:42.23]I'll translate as I go along
[00:47.34]
[00:48.68]Fly me to the moon
[00:51.95]And let me play among the stars
[00:58.38]won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
[01:09.49]In other words: Hold my hand!
[01:15.32]In other words: Darling kiss me!
[01:20.68]Fill my heart with song,
[01:24.11]And let me sing forever more
[01:30.66]Cause you are all long for all I worship and adore
[01:41.83]In other words: Please be true!
[01:47.39]In other words: I love you!
