[00:01.12]李映熹 - Memory
[00:02.40]
[00:05.28]midnight
[00:07.56]not a sound from the pavement
[00:12.00]has the moon lost her memory
[00:16.50]she is smiling alone
[00:19.65]
[00:21.34]in the lamplight
[00:24.46]the withered leaves collect at my feet
[00:30.18]and the wind begins to moan
[00:37.79]
[00:39.93]memory
[00:42.52]all alone in the moonlight
[00:46.72]I can smile at the old days
[00:51.41]life was beautiful then
[00:54.74]
[00:56.32]I remember
[00:59.09]the time I knew what happiness was
[01:05.78]let the memory live again
[01:12.49]
[01:13.02]every street lamp seems to beat
[01:21.05]a fatalistic warning
[01:30.05]someone mutters and a street lamp sbutters
[01:38.35]and soon it will be morning
[01:45.59]
[01:47.46]daylight
[01:49.96]I must wait for the sunrise
[01:54.48]I must think of a new life
[01:59.05]and I mustn't give in
[02:02.71]
[02:03.52]when the dawn comes
[02:07.00]tonight will be a memory too
[02:12.70]and a new day will begin
[02:20.20]
[02:51.52]burnt out ends of smoky days
[03:00.01]the stale cold smell of morning
[03:08.77]the street lamp dies
[03:12.73]another night is over
[03:17.23]another day is dawning
[03:24.30]
[03:26.61]touch me
[03:29.36]It's so easy to leave me
[03:33.32]all alone with my memory
[03:37.73]of my days in the sun
[03:42.39]
[03:43.03]if you touch me
[03:45.51]you'll understand what happiness is
[03:51.11]look a new day has begun ...
