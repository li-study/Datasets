[00:04.24]pjllbad
[00:04.84]
[00:06.67]Hmmmm...Yeah, yeah.
[00:16.68]I back again, in this town, to find a girl that i used to know.
[00:23.84]I bumped into, a friend of mine, and she told me where to go.
[00:30.89]She said go right down, the 56th street, make a left at the corner store.
[00:38.40]There‘ll be a house in the alley way,
[00:41.03]Hope she didn‘t move away.
[00:43.13]I pray she‘s still around,
[00:45.44]But somebody came to the door that I didn‘t know,
[00:49.29]And I knew to let it go,
[00:52.96]Is it over, all over.
[00:57.85]I let a good girl get away
[00:59.72]
[01:00.52]How could I ever let her get away?
[01:00.66]Chorus:
[01:04.81]Today is not a happy day,
[01:07.83]So many words that I had to say,
[01:11.18]And baby I miss you and I need you your love,
[01:15.52]How could i ever let her get away?
[01:19.51]Today is not a happy day,
[01:22.67]It could‘ve been our anniversary,
[01:25.95]I‘d do anything to have you right here in my arms.
[01:29.89]
[01:30.63]Remember when, we talked about,
[01:33.63]All the things that we planned to do.
[01:37.55]Our wedding day, our house in the valley,
[01:41.80]Maybe a kid or two.
[01:44.60]We could‘ve had it all babe,
[01:48.53]But somehow it all fell apart.
[01:52.18]I agree to take the blame,
[01:54.71]See I‘m feeling so ashamed.
[01:57.03]I never should‘ve lied.
[01:59.34]
[02:00.34]Bridge:
[02:00.69]I‘d give anything (I‘d do anything baby)
[02:04.05]To see your pretty face again.
[02:07.71]Hold you, to feel you,
[02:10.58]Heaven give me one more chance.
[02:12.83]
[02:14.53]How could I ever let her get away?
[02:18.69]Today is not a happy day,
[02:21.80]So many words that I had to say,
[02:25.16]And baby I miss you and I need you your love,
[02:29.44]How could i ever let her get away?
[02:33.39]Today is not a happy day,
[02:36.79]It could‘ve been our anniversary,
[02:40.01]I‘d do anything to have you right here in my arms.
[02:43.08]
[02:45.87]If only it were possible,
[02:47.69]For me to turn back the hands of time.
[02:51.48]I‘d do anything, give anything,
[02:54.80]Just to make her mine,
[02:58.75]I can‘t live without your love babe,
[03:02.43]I can‘t go on another day.
[03:05.93]Where did she go?
[03:07.69]I gotta know.
[03:10.19]I let a good girl get away
[03:12.13]
[03:13.86]How could I ever let her get away?
[03:17.73]Today is not a happy day,
[03:21.09]So many words that I had to say,
