[00:00.40]Nicholas:
[00:00.54]Alone at night
[00:05.07]I feel so strange
[00:09.40]I need to find
[00:14.35]All the answers to my dreams
[00:20.33]
[00:22.22]When I sleep at night
[00:26.30]I hear the cries
[00:28.99]What does this mean?
[00:33.39]
[00:48.20]I shut the door and traveled to another home
[00:55.06]I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
[01:01.22]I felt that I could trust him
[01:04.44]He talked to me that night:
[01:06.82]
[01:07.21]Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?
[01:12.89]This fatal tragedy was talked about for years
[01:19.13]Victorias gone forever
[01:22.31]Only memories remain
[01:25.81]She passed away
[01:28.32]She was so young
[01:33.02]
[01:47.14]Without love
[01:48.83]Without truth
[01:50.98]There can be no turning back
[01:56.71]
[01:57.29]Without faith
[01:58.75]Without hope
[02:00.06]There can be no peace of mind
[02:03.55]
[02:24.52]As the night went on
[02:30.35]I started to find my way
[02:37.89]I learned about a tragedy
[02:44.33]A mystery still today
[02:50.55]
[02:51.59]I tried to get more answers
[02:54.76]But he said, youre on your own
[02:58.20]Then he turned away and left me
[03:01.30]As I stand there all alone
[03:05.05]He said, you'll know the truth
[03:08.30]As you future days unfold
[03:16.19]
[03:26.37]Without love
[03:28.01]Without truth
[03:30.21]There can be no turning back
[03:36.15]
[03:36.51]Without faith
[03:37.90]Without hope
[03:39.31]There can be no peace of mind
[03:43.23]
[06:40.98]Hypnotherapist:
[06:42.13]Now it is time to see how you died
[06:45.18]Remember that death is not the endbut only a transition
