[00:04.82]Lyrics：
[00:23.33]Same old story is back again
[00:27.18]She's not a lover, she's just a friend
[00:30.96]I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
[00:38.32]Now you think it's funny
[00:41.42]Now you wanna spend your money on girls
[00:45.95]But you forgot when you were down
[00:49.37]That I was around
[00:54.32]Call my lover, hang up, call again
[00:58.17]What in the world is happening
[01:01.67]Listen in,
[01:04.41]but don't yell at me
[01:09.39]Isn't it ironic all you wanna do is smoke chronic
[01:16.24]Boy, you forgot when you were down
[01:20.69]Who was around
[01:25.66]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[01:29.60]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[01:32.86]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
[01:41.16]Memories don't live like people do
[01:44.54]I'm sick for ever believing you
[01:48.50]Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
[01:51.03]Was good to me, oh lord
[01:55.15]Everytime you say you're coming
[01:59.07]Boy, you disappoint me, honey
[02:02.83]How well you forgot when you were down
[02:06.98]And I was around
[02:12.11]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[02:16.00]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[02:19.22]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
[02:27.45]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[02:31.52]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[02:34.85]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
[02:44.99]One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
[02:48.72]Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe yeah yeah
[03:00.09]One of these days, when your dreams come true
[03:03.96]That's the one that's gonna do it to you
[03:06.60]Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:14.04]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[03:17.97]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[03:21.19]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
[03:29.48]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[03:33.41]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[03:36.62]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
[03:45.02]I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
[03:48.83]Waiting for love to walk through the door
[03:52.21]I wish I didn't miss you anymore
