[00:04.24]How the hell did we wind up like this
[00:07.37]Why weren't we able
[00:09.64]To see the signs that we missed

[01:08.13]Now the story's played out like this
[01:11.51]Just like a paperback novel
[01:14.01]Lets rewrite an ending that fits
[01:17.44]Instead of a hollywood horror
[01:20.28]Nothin's wrong
[01:21.73]just as long as
[01:22.84]you know that someday I will
