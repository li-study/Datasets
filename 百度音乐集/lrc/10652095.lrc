[00:00.00]I'll tell you how the stories told
[00:17.00]I'll tell you how the stories told
[00:19.78]I always wanted so much more
[00:22.46]And way on down the road
[00:24.48]I caught a glimpse of the sunlight
[00:27.98]Working on my favorite thing
[00:30.45]using every piece of me
[00:33.07]Drinking, and smoking, and fucking, and making nothing
[00:37.98]I didn't do it for money
[00:39.22]I did it all for free
[00:42.70]I did it all to fill the fucking hole inside of me
[00:48.49]So far it's working out
[00:51.75]Everything's different now
[00:52.89]So far
[00:58.73]Think about what you know
[01:01.28]Forget about what your told
[01:04.08]See how your story grows and let it come from your own mind
[01:09.45]Do all your favorite things
[01:12.19]Cover it with all your dreams
[01:14.80]Breathe it, and smoke it, and fuck it and make it something
[01:19.61]I didn't do it for money
[01:22.48]I did it all for free
[01:24.44]I did it all to fill the fucking hole inside of me
[01:30.19]So far it's working out
[01:33.12]Everything's different now
[01:34.58]So far
[01:40.91]So far the mean machine
[01:43.18]Hasn't got the best of me
[01:45.41]So far
