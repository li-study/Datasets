[00:20.67]Don't put me off 'cause I'm on fire
[00:23.90]And I can't quench my desire
[00:27.33]Don't you know that
[00:28.41]I'm burning up for your love
[00:31.26]You're not convinced that that is enough
[00:34.61]I put myself in this position
[00:37.92]And I deserve the imposition
[00:40.93]But you don't even know I'm alive
[00:44.78]And this pounding in my heart just won't die
[00:48.26]I'm burning up
[00:51.80]I'm burning up, burning up for your love
[00:55.30]I'm burning up, burning up for your love
[00:58.35]I'm burning up, burning up for your love
[01:02.00]For your love
[01:05.73]You're always closing your door
[01:08.97]Well that only makes me want you more
[01:12.89]And day and night I cry for your love
[01:16.88]You're not convinced that that is enough
[01:19.82]To justify my wanting you
[01:23.52]Now tell me what you want me to do
[01:26.49]I'm not blind and I know
[01:29.84]That you want to want me but you can't let go
[01:33.46]Come on, let go
[01:34.28]

[01:47.37]For your love
[01:50.67]Oh
[01:51.77]Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
[01:54.97]Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?
[01:58.53]Unlike the others I'd do anything
[02:01.15]I'm not the same, I have no shame
[02:04.86]I'm on fire
[02:05.57]
[02:22.18]Come on, let go
[02:22.85]
[02:40.64]Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
[02:43.32]Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?
[02:47.05]Unlike the others I'd do anything
[02:50.29]I'm not the same, I have no shame
[02:53.41]I'm on fire
[02:54.44]
