[00:02.53]October Swimmer
[00:03.38]
[00:04.18]JJ72
[00:04.97]
[00:07.86]The dreams of dying mothers
[00:15.16]I awoke, my insides shuddered
[00:22.94]the greycoats of the infantry
[00:26.85]victims looking for sympathy
[00:30.11]and splash of october swimmers
[00:37.85]the cheers of Helsinki winners
[00:45.39]my barbed bones of futility
[00:49.30]leeking marrow of ability
[00:52.31]
[00:52.57]And I don't need anyone
[01:00.45]and you don't need anyone
[01:06.93]
[01:08.03]I want to be a happy boy
[01:11.64]this means that you must employ my lies
[01:18.36]when I want you
[01:22.39]
[01:22.99]And I don't need anyone
[01:30.33]I want to be a happy boy
[01:34.28]this means that you must employ my lies
[01:42.90]
[02:00.54]And I don't need anyone
[02:08.02]and you don't need anyone
[02:14.41]
[02:15.21]I want to be a happy boy
[02:19.07]this means that you must employ my lies
[02:25.79]when I want you
[02:29.87]
[02:30.43]And I don't need anyone (3x)
