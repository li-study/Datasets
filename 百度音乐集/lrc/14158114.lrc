[00:00.34]Hey, kid, you've got
[00:02.93]a lot of potential but I think its time to move up
[00:07.96]so go on and blow us away with your sound;
[00:10.77]Now you're everything that we've come to love,
[00:16.07]you taught us to move, so we'll show it off,
[00:20.07]just drop us the beat...
[00:25.33]
[00:31.87]Here's to the fast times; the times we felt alive;
[00:38.31]to all the nights that we forgot to get back home.
[00:43.76]Stay seventeen,
[00:46.46]the party scene has got the best of me and you,
[00:50.32]we've got to let this go...
[00:54.07]
[00:56.32]Drink up last call before the sunrise sets the scene,
[01:01.00]of empty bottles, heavy hearts,
[01:03.86]the memories of broken dreams...
[01:06.96]We were so tired yet so alive,
[01:10.13]wrapped up in lies like sheets of another one night stand,
[01:14.64]you know you left the girl with nothing but the,
[01:18.31]
[01:18.41]Sunrise through the window pane, where tired eyes will close....
[01:28.16]Stay seventeen, the party scene has got the best of me and you,
[01:35.20]we've got to let this go...
[01:39.69]
[01:41.16]I know she hopes I choke on this last drink,
[01:45.16]drop dead before my influence gets to her head...
[01:49.54]She said, "I'll love you forever, or find something better.
[01:54.00]It's all just the same as when we sleep together.
[01:56.66]We wake up with headaches, and trouble remembering
[02:00.27]what went wrong..."
[02:04.20]
[02:19.44]Stay seventeen,
[02:25.91]the party scene has got the best of me and you,
[02:30.04]we've got to let this go...
[02:38.35]
