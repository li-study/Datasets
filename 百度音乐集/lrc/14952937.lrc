[00:08]CIRCLE OF LIFE
[00:12]MUSIC BY ELTON JOHN
[00:16]PERFORMED BY ELTON JOHN
[00:24]FROM THE DAY WE ARRIVE ON THE PLANET
[00:30]AND BLINKING, STEP INTO THE SUN
[00:35]THERE'S MORE TO BE SEEN THAN CAN EVER BE SEEN
[00:41]MORE TO DO THAN CAN EVER BE DONE
[00:48]SOME SAY EAT OR BE EATEN
[00:53]SOME SAY LIVE AND LET LIVE
[00:59]BUT ALL ARE AGREED AD THEY JOIN THE STMPEDE
[01:05]YOU SHOULD NEVER TAKE MORE THAN YOU GIVE
[02:45][01:11]IN THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
[03:33][02:51][01:16]IT'S THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
[03:38][02:56][01:21]IT'S THE LEAP OF FAITH
[03:44][03:02][01:27]IT'S THE BAND OF HOPE
[03:50][03:08][01:33]TILL WE FIND OUR PLACE
[04:20][03:55][03:14][01:39]ON THE PATH UNWINDING
[04:27][04:03][03:20][01:45]IN THE CIRCLE,IN THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
[01:59]SOME OF US FALL BY THE WAYSIDE
[02:05]AND SOME OF US SOAR TO THE STARS
[02:11]AND SOME OF US SAIL THROUGH OUR TROUBLES
[02:16]AND SOME HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE SCARES
[02:22]THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN HERE
[02:28]MORE TO FIND THAN CAN EVER BE FOUND
[02:34]BUT THE SUN ROLLING HOIGH
[02:37]THROUGH THE SAPPHIRE SKY
[02:40]KEEPS GREAT AND SMALL ON THE ENDLESS ROUND
