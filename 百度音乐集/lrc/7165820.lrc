[00:01.78]The Last Living Rose
[00:02.38]PJ Harvey
[00:03.10]
[00:05.97]Goddamn' Europeans!
[00:10.48]Take me back to beautiful England
[00:15.11]And the grey, damp filthiness of ages
[00:21.21]And battered books
[00:23.61]And fog rolling down behind the mountains
[00:29.13]On the graveyards and dead sea captains.
[00:34.07]Let me walk through the stinking alleys
[00:38.50]To the music of drunken beatings
[00:43.06]Past the thames river glistening
[00:47.78]Like gold hastily sold
[00:51.78]For nothing. nothing.
[00:56.87]
[01:16.17]Let me watch night fall on the river
[01:20.62]The moon rise up and turn to silver
[01:24.95]The sky move
[01:27.54]The ocean shimmer
[01:29.57]The hedge shake
[01:31.19]The last living rose quiver.
