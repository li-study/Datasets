[00:10.12]演唱者:C21
[00:15.18]專輯:listen
[00:20.32]
[00:25.17]You know I’m gonna make a try
[00:28.70]I never wanna let it die
[00:31.70]But this ain’t right
[00:32.91]Don’t justify
[00:36.34]
[00:37.07]You – you`re everything I need
[00:40.93]But sometimes we just disagree
[00:44.13]And this is my way to proceed
[00:48.91]
[00:50.30]Silence cannot breathe on your side
[00:53.85]But emptiness is my wound
[00:56.75]’Cuz I’m in pain why can’t you see I’m down
[01:01.82]Being the one just around
[01:06.57]
[01:07.91]I’ll stay away ’till it`s over
[01:12.28]’Cuz you need to realize
[01:17.19]It’s time for me to go
[01:19.78]Please stay away ’till it`s over
[01:24.66]And I will clear my thoughts again
[01:29.61]Crazy or blind
[01:32.13]I’ll stay away ’till it`s gone
[01:41.07]
[01:48.00]You – you`re everything I want
[01:51.72]The reason why I wrote this song
[01:54.75]I’ll be back when words are gone
[01:59.65]
[02:00.94]If silence can`t survive on your side
[02:04.52]Then loneliness is my pride
[02:07.59]When I’m in pain why can`t you see I’m down
[02:12.46]Being the one just around
[02:18.30]I’ll stay away ’till it`s over
[02:23.49]’Cuz you need to realize
[02:27.83]It’s time for me to go
[02:30.61]Please stay away ’till it`s over
[02:35.51]And I will clear my thoughts again
[02:40.18]Crazy or blind
[02:42.95]I’ll stay away ’till it`s gone
[02:45.84]
[02:47.89]hahhh~~
[02:54.68]
[02:57.67]You have to understand
[03:00.43]you have to let it go
[03:03.52]It`s only for a while
[03:13.85]I’ll stay away ’till it`s over
[03:18.55]’Cuz you need to realize
[03:23.13]It’s time for me to go
[03:25.97]Please stay away ’till it`s over
[03:30.83]And I will clear my thoughts again
[03:35.62]Crazy or blind
[03:38.57]I’ll stay away ’till it`s gone
