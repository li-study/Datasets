[00:10.00]
[00:12.22]我闭目回首我们曾一起走过的十年
[00:17.49]每一段我们共同穿越过的闪耀光年
[00:23.00]我侧耳倾听我们曾一起写下的歌谣
[00:28.06]每一个我们彼此都无法抹掉的音符
[00:33.55]再一次出发总是比曾经的路更坎坷
[00:38.73]因为有你有我就没有过不去的河
[00:44.25]如果说幸运的是我们今天还在唱歌
[00:49.40]此时此刻我只想唱给你一个人
[00:55.94]Everyone wants to be better
[01:01.13]Nobody wants to be a day dreamer
[01:10.55]Oh we used to be fighters never tired and now
[01:16.84]We're singing at the centre of the stage
[01:23.89]Oh we rely on each other just like brothers now 
[01:30.16]We're dreaming on and on and on
[01:40.21]
[01:50.72]再一次出发总是比曾经的路更坎坷

[02:06.77]此时此刻我只想唱给你一个人
[02:13.27]Everyone wants a success
[02:18.65]We are smiling to the world
[02:27.93]Oh we used to be fighters never tired and now 
[02:34.18]We're singing at the centre of the stage
[02:41.23]Oh we rely on each other just like brothers now
[02:47.55]We're dreaming on and on and on
[02:54.51]Oh we used to be fighters never tired and now
[03:00.81]It's time to raise up our mind
