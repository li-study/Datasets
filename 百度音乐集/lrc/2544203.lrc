[00:01.36]Ooh, Mr. Todd! (kiss)
[00:02.41]I'm so happy! (kiss)
[00:03.38]I could (kiss)
[00:04.18]Eat you up, I really could!
[00:05.85]You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd? (kiss)
[00:07.91]What I dream (kiss)
[00:09.10]If the business stays as good?
[00:10.43]Where I'd really like to go,
[00:13.31]In a year or so?
[00:16.57]Don't you want to know?
[00:19.12]Do you really want to know?
[00:20.94]
[00:28.48]By the sea, Mr. Todd, that's the life I covet,
[00:31.58]By the sea, Mr. Todd, ooh, I know you'd love it!
[00:34.54]You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone
[00:37.89]In a house wot we'd almost own,
[00:40.26]Down by the sea!
[00:41.50]
[00:41.64]Anything you say...
[00:42.75]
[00:43.02]Wouldn't that be smashing?
[00:47.00]Think how snug it'll be underneath our flannel
[00:49.96]When it's just you and me and the English Channel!
[00:52.90]In our cozy retreat kept all neat and tidy,
[00:55.99]We'll have chums over ev'ry Friday!
[00:58.65]By the sea,
[01:01.22]Don'tcha love the weather?
[01:04.74]By the sea!
[01:07.66]We'll grow old together!
[01:10.87]By the seaside,
[01:13.05]Hoo, hoo!
[01:14.27]By the beautiful sea!
[01:16.07]
[01:20.72]It'll be so quiet,
[01:22.46]That who'll come by it,
[01:23.88]Except a seagull
[01:25.37]Hoo, hoo!
[01:26.86]We shouldn't try it,
[01:28.37]Though, 'til it's legal for two-hoo!
[01:32.79]But a seaside wedding could be devised,
[01:35.80]Me rumpled bedding legitimized!
[01:38.80]Me eyelids'll flutter,
[01:40.32]I'll turn into butter,
[01:41.77]The moment I mutter I do-hoo!
[01:45.08]
[01:52.90]Down By the sea,
[01:55.88]Married nice and proper!
[01:59.32]By the sea,
[02:01.81]Bring along your chopper!
[02:05.32]To the seaside,
[02:07.33]Hoo, hoo!
[02:08.04]By the beautiful sea!
[02:12.19]
