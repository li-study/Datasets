[00:00.42]This is got to die
[00:07.99]This is got to stop
[00:15.83]This has got to lie down
[00:22.55]Someone else on top
[00:30.52]You can keep me pinned
[00:37.45]It's easier to tease
[00:44.89]But you can't paint an elephant
[00:51.82]Quite as good as she
[00:59.57]And she may cry like a baby
[01:14.00]And she may drive me Crazy
[01:29.02]'Cause I am lately lonely
[01:57.10]So why d'you have to lie?
[02:04.54]I take it I'm your crutch
[02:11.88]The pillow in your pillow case
[02:19.15]It's easier to touch
[02:26.83]And when you think you've sinned
[02:33.84]Do you fall upon your knees?
[02:41.08]And do you sit within your picture?
[02:48.15]Do you still forget the breeze?
[02:55.52]And she may rise, if I sing you down
[03:10.70]And she may wisely cling to the ground
[03:25.47]Cause I'm lately horny
[03:54.59]So why would she take me horny?
[04:23.84]What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
[04:31.68]You've already gone, why am I clinging?
[04:38.78]Well I could throw it out, and I could live without
[04:42.53]And I could do it all for you
[04:44.89]I could be strong
[04:48.09]Tell me if you want me to lie
[04:50.70]'Cause this has got to die
[04:57.70]This has got to stop
[05:05.60]This has got to lie down, down
[05:12.65]With someone else on top
[05:20.17]You can both keep me pinned
[05:27.59]'Cause it's easier to tease
[05:34.54]But you can't make me happy
[05:42.15]Quite as good as me
[05:51.87]Well you know that's a lie
