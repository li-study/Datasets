
[00:01.64]The Time of my life
[00:02.05]David Cook
[00:02.70]
[00:03.58]I’ve been waiting for my dreams
[00:07.16]To turn into something
[00:10.37]I could believe in
[00:12.10]And looking for that
[00:15.25]Magic rainbow
[00:17.03]On the horizon
[00:19.35]I couldn’t see it
[00:21.43]Until I let go
[00:24.01]Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn
[00:30.26]Now I’m coming alive
[00:33.25]Body and soul
[00:35.59]And feelin’ my world start to turn
[00:39.11]
[00:39.60]And I’ll taste every moment
[00:42.20]And live it out loud
[00:44.33]I know this is the time,
[00:47.48]This is the time
[00:49.01]To be more than a name
[00:51.50]Or a face in the crowd
[00:53.57]I know this is the time
[00:56.12]This is the time of my life
[01:02.34]Time of my life
[01:05.59]
[01:08.55]Holding onto things that vanished
[01:12.95]Into the air
[01:15.00]Left me in pieces
[01:17.05]But now I’m rising from the ashes
[01:22.04]Finding my wings
[01:24.35]And all that I needed
[01:26.34]Was there all along
[01:29.04]Within my reach
[01:31.22]As close as the beat of my heart
[01:35.22]And I’ll taste every moment
[01:37.89]And live it out loud
[01:39.88]I know this is the time,
[01:42.75]This is the time to be
[01:45.20]More than a name
[01:47.25]Or a face in the crowd
[01:49.16]I know this is the time
[01:51.87]This is the time of my life
[01:57.97]Time of my life
[02:03.26]And I’m out on the edge of forever
[02:07.41]Ready to run
[02:13.13]Keeping my feet on the ground
[02:16.68]My arms open wide
[02:19.01]Face to the sun
[02:22.07]I’ll taste every moment
[02:24.46]And live it out loud
[02:26.44]I know this is the time,
[02:29.44]This is the time to be
[02:31.74]More than a name
[02:33.76]Or a face in the crowd
[02:35.71]I know this is the time
[02:38.47]This is the time of my life
[02:44.87]My life
[02:49.84]More than a name
[02:51.78]Or a face in the crowd
[02:53.92]I know this is the time
[02:56.81]This is the time of my life
[03:06.47]This is the time of my life
[03:16.54]Time of my life
[03:21.54]Time of my life
[03:24.54]
