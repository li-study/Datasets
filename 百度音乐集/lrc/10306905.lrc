[00:03.41]
[00:09.27]Happy Birthday
[00:10.82]
[00:17.00]so make a wish
[00:19.08]
[00:20.01]Please accept my apologies  wonder what would have been
[00:23.11]Would you've been a little angel or an angel of sin
[00:25.67]Tom-boy running around  hanging with all the guys
[00:28.42]Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes
[00:30.98]I payed for the murder before they determined the sex
[00:33.43]Choosing our life over your life meant your death
[00:36.02]And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
[00:38.44]Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you faught for your life
[00:41.00]Would you have been a little genius in love with math
[00:43.54]Would you have played in your schoolclothes and made me mad
[00:46.10]Would you have been a little rapper like your papa da Piper
[00:48.77]Would you have made me quit smokin' by finding one of my lighters
[00:51.51]I wonder about your skintone and shape of your nose
[00:53.94]And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
[00:56.36]Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
[00:58.89]Happy birthday  love you whoever you woulda been
[01:01.57]Happy birthday
[01:02.50]All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
[01:07.13]Was as real as it seemed (happy birthday)
[01:12.40]All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
[01:17.63]Was as real as it seemed
[01:20.87]I made a mistake
[01:22.02]I've got a millon excuses to why you died
[01:24.59]Bet the people got their own reasons for homicide
[01:27.11]Who's to say it woulda worked, and who's to say it wouldn't have
[01:29.74]I was young and strugglin' but old enough to be your dad
[01:32.27]The fear of being a father has never disappeared
[01:34.90]Pondering frequently while I'm zippin' on my beer
[01:37.38]My vision of a family was artificial and fake
[01:39.95]So when it came time to create I made a mistake
[01:42.29]Now you've got a little brother maybe he's really you
[01:44.94]Maybe you really forgave us knowin' we was confused
[01:47.65]Maybe everytime that he smiles it's you proudly knowin
[01:50.49]That your father's doin' the right thing now
[01:52.62]I never tell a woman what to do with her body
[01:55.07]But if she don't love children then we can't party
[01:57.65]Think about it every year  so I picked up a pen
[02:00.17]Happy birthday  love you whoever you woulda been
[02:02.84]Happy birthday
[02:03.81]All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
[02:08.67]Was as real as it seemed (happy birthday)
[02:13.67]All I thought was a dream (yeah  make a wish)
[02:18.75]Was as real as it seemed
[02:21.82]I made a mistake
[02:23.35]And from the heavens to the womb to the heavens again
[02:25.78]From the endin' to the endin  never got to begin
[02:28.26]Maybe one day we could meet face to face
[02:30.90]In a place without time and space
[02:32.77]Happy birthday
[02:33.49]From the heavens to the womb to the heavens again
[02:35.94]From the endin to the endin  never got to begin
[02:38.47]Maybe one day we could meet face to face
[02:41.03]In a place without time and space
[02:43.08]Happy birthday
[02:44.64]All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
[02:49.42]Was as real as it seemed (happy birthday)
[02:54.52]All I thought was a dream (make a wish)
[02:59.41]Was as real as it seemed
[03:02.90]I made a mistake
