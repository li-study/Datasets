[00:35.00]Older chests reveal themselves
[00:38.97]Like a crack in a wall
[00:41.56]Starting small, and grow in time
[00:51.29]And we (always) seem to need the help
[00:56.28]Of someone else
[00:59.39]To mend that shelf
[01:01.12](of) Too many books
[01:03.97]Read me your favourite line
[01:10.13]Papa went to other lands
[01:13.53]And he found someone who understands
[01:17.92]The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
[01:26.12]He came back the other day, yeah you know
[01:31.53]Some things in life may change
[01:35.41]And some things
[01:37.62]They stay the same
[01:43.51]Like time, there's always time
[01:51.98]On my mind
[02:00.37]So pass me by, I'll be fine
[02:08.58]Just give me time
[02:20.41]Older gents sit on the fence
[02:23.44]With their cap in hand
[02:28.43]Looking grand
[02:32.80]They watch their city change
[02:37.73]Children scream, or so it seems,
[02:41.31]Louder than before
[02:46.05]Out of doors, into stores with bigger names
[02:55.10]Mama tried to wash their faces
[02:59.02]But these kids they lost their graces
[03:03.53]And daddy lost at the races too many times
[03:12.39]She broke down the other day, yeah you know
[03:16.79]Some things in life may change
[03:21.12]But some things they stay the same
[03:29.74]Like time, time, there's always time
[03:35.67]On my mind
[03:45.38]So pass me by, I'll be fine
[03:52.70]Just give me time,
[03:58.65]Time, there's always time
[04:10.86]On my mind
[04:20.37]Pass me by, I'll be fine
[04:27.39]Just give me time
