[00:14.89]It is cold, in this October rain
[00:23.45]I go to turn on TV
[00:28.48]Sit on the couch feeling blue
[00:33.57]Wait till the phone starts too ring
[00:38.70]I start to think you forgot
[00:43.89]Just as you always do
[00:48.90]I don’t want to hear your excuse bla..bla.bla
[00:54.08]‘Cause it all makes my day turn to gray
[01:01.17]Feeling bored, it starts to haunt me again
[01:09.40]I start to discover some clues
[01:14.47]Wondering what you have done
[01:19.99]Everything went really bad
[01:25.13]I started feel very mad
[01:30.15]Just as I always do
[01:35.08]I don’t want to hear your excuse bla..bla..bla
[01:40.72]‘Cause it all makes my day turn to gray
[01:47.97]The time passes me by
[01:52.07]As I listen to lullaby
[01:56.96]When the phone start to ring
[01:59.80]I am drowning in my dream
