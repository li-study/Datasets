[00:02.00]Paul Simon"The Obvious Child"歌词
[00:04.00]
[00:25.92]I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
[00:28.86]Or maybe i'm a dog who's lost its bite
[00:31.00]I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
[00:34.13]I don't expect to sleep through the night
[00:36.23]Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
[00:39.00]But i say why
[00:41.00]Why deny the obvious child?
[00:43.00]Why deny the obvious child?
[00:46.98]And in remembering a road sign
[00:49.66]I am remembering a girl when i was young
[00:55.00]And we said these songs are true
[00:57.00]These days are ours
[00:58.00]These tears are free And hey
[01:02.16]The cross is in the ballpark
[01:04.19]The cross is in the ballpark
[01:07.85]We had a lot of fun
[01:08.58]We had a lot of money
[01:13.50]We had a little son and we thought we'd call him sonny
[01:19.08]Sonny gets married and moves away
[01:21.00]Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
[01:24.00]Sonny gets sunnier
[01:25.00]Day by day by day by day
[01:26.23]。。。。。
[01:38.13]I've been waking up at sunrise
[01:41.13]I've been following the light across my room
[01:43.19]I watch the night receive the room of my day
[01:48.00]Some people say the sky is just the sky
[01:52.00]But i say
[01:53.00]Why deny the obvious child?
[01:56.01]Why deny the obvious child?
[01:58.78]
[02:10.00]Sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself
[02:15.18]How it's strange that some rooms are like cages
[02:19.32]Sonny's yearbook from high school
[02:23.00]Is down from the shelf
[02:25.50]And he idly thumbs through the pages
[02:30.00]Some have died
[02:31.83]Some have fled from themselves
[02:35.03]Or struggled from here to get there
[02:40.00]Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
[02:44.96]Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair
[02:50.00]Well i'm accustomed to a smoother ride
[02:51.27]Maybe i'm a dog that's lost his bite
[02:54.00]I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
[02:57.00]I don't expect to sleep the night
[02:59.00]Some people say a lie is just a lie
[02:59.82]But i say the cross is in the ballpark
[03:05.00]Why deny the obvious child?
