[00:22.87]Oh, so long together,
[00:25.95]Forgot how you made me feel,
[00:28.00]Tired of each other,
[00:29.53]We drifted further afield,
[00:32.17]But there was nothing out there for me,
[00:36.07]I realised you're all I needed
[00:39.07]
[00:39.35]Now that i got you caught
[00:41.04]I don't know what I did before,
[00:42.71]You've made my life so special,
[00:46.82]Everything that I had before you,
[00:48.80]Give it to me with much more,
[00:50.47]That's why I can never let you go,

[01:18.25]Couldn't remember,
[01:20.03]Just what made me fall for you,
[01:22.17]Searching for others,
[01:23.80]They make me feel all blue,
[01:26.20]But every time I felt that feeling,
[01:30.23]I knew it wasn't what I needed,
[01:33.16]
[01:33.54]First I nearly got you caught,
[01:35.29]I felt better than I felt before,
[01:37.16]You've made my life so special,
[01:40.95]Everything that I could want you,
[01:42.96]Give it to me every part,
[01:44.64]That's why I'd never let you go,
