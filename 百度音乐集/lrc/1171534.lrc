[00:00.00]Christina Aguilera - Infatuation
[00:19.66]
[00:21.66]He comes from a foreign place
[00:24.41]An island far away
[00:27.00]Intrigues me with every move
[00:28.93]Til I'm breathless, I'm helpless
[00:30.62]Can't keep my cool
[00:32.29]Steals my heart when he takes my hand
[00:34.88]And we dance to the rhythm of the band
[00:37.65]Feel his fingertips grip my hips
[00:39.61]And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss
[00:42.92]Mami used to warn me to beware those latin lovers
[00:47.53]Said I gave my heart too soon
[00:49.42]And that's how I became your mother
[00:52.72]Said ay mama, you seem to forget
[00:55.00]I'm not in love yet
[00:55.84]Sweet talk don't win me over
[00:58.79]But I realize
[01:00.42]Big brown eyes I'm hypnotized
[01:02.61]When he says
[03:31.95][02:18.19][01:04.11]"I am full blood BORICUA"
[03:34.51][02:20.60][01:06.69]Read the tattoo on his arm
[03:36.92][02:23.12][01:09.23]He tells me "Mami, I need ya!"
[03:39.71][02:25.74][01:11.86]And my heartbeat pumps so strong
[03:42.19][02:28.48][01:14.54]Getting lost in a ritmo
[03:44.15][02:30.04][01:16.16]He whispers "Te quiero"
[03:46.26][02:32.40][01:18.49]Te quiero
[03:47.63][02:33.69][01:19.74]I begin to give in with no hesitation
[03:51.22][02:37.34][01:23.46]Can't help my infatuation
[03:54.35][02:40.82][01:26.90]
[03:57.83][02:42.85][01:28.94]It's pure infatuation
[01:32.20]
[01:35.40]Skin the color of cinnamon
[01:37.96]His eyes light up
[01:38.81]And I'm filled within
[01:40.91]Feels so good it must be a sin
[01:42.83]I can't stop what I started I'm giving in
[01:46.25]He brings life to my fantasies
[01:48.70]Sparks a passion inside of me
[01:51.43]Finds the words and I cannot speak
[01:53.43]In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me
[01:56.76]Mami used to warn me not to rush love with another
[02:01.32]Said I'm not trying to lecture
[02:03.58]I just care about my daughter
[02:07.02]Ay mama, you seem to forget
[02:08.80]I never will let
[02:09.81]A man control my emotions
[02:13.00]When he smiles
[02:14.69]I feel like a little child
[02:16.50]When he says
[02:46.05]
[02:49.66]Caught between my mother's words
[02:51.81]And what I feel inside
[02:54.92]Wanting to explore his world
[02:57.04]But part of me wants to hide
[03:00.02]Should I risk it
[03:01.27]Can't resist it
[03:02.13]This has caught me by surprise
[03:04.64]Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico
[03:08.08]I can't hold back no more
[03:09.44]Let's go tonight
[03:14.67]
[04:01.97]Can't help my infatuation
[04:03.98]
[04:07.44]It's pure infatuation (Infatuation)
[04:10.50]
