[00:06.83]演唱：Glen Campbell
[00:09.72]I've been walking these streets so long
[00:13.95]Singing the same old song
[00:18.08]I know every crack and crevice
[00:21.81]out here in Broadway
[00:26.23]Where hustle's the name of the game
[00:30.61]And white boys get washed down the drain like the snow and the rain
[00:38.40]It's easy love compromising
[00:42.55]On the road to my horizon
[00:47.18]But I wanna be where the lights are shining on me
[00:54.10]Like a rhinestone cowboy
[00:59.36]Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
[01:06.62]Like a rhinestone cowboy
[01:11.90]Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
[01:18.54]And offers coming over the phone
[01:28.75]Well, I really don't mind the rain
[01:32.85]And a smile can hide all the pain
[01:37.02]But you're walkin these streets so long out here in broadway
[01:45.25]And i dream of the things I'll do
[01:49.34]With a subway token and a dollar tucked into my shoe
[01:57.49]It's easy love compromising
[02:01.71]On the road to my horizon
[02:06.41]But I ganna be where the lights are shining on me
[02:11.02]
[02:13.21]Like a rhinestone cowboy
[02:18.45]Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
[02:26.37]Rhinestone cowboy
[02:31.00]Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
[02:37.63]And offers coming over the phone
[02:46.61]Like a rhinestone cowboy
[02:51.80]Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
[02:59.68]Rhinestone cowboy
[03:04.28]Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
[03:11.94]Like a rhinestone cowboy
