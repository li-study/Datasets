[00:30.99]I'm older than I'd wish to be
[00:34.63]This town hold no more for me
[00:38.83]All my life I try to find another way
[00:45.85]I don't care for your attitude
[00:49.86]You bring me down I think you're rude
[00:53.66]All my life I try to make a better day
[01:01.42]It's hard enough being alone
[01:05.13]Sitting here by the phone
[01:08.79]Waiting for my memories
[01:11.47]To come and play
[01:16.49]It's hard enough sitting there
[01:20.17]Rockin' in your rockin' chair
[01:24.15]It's all too much to take
[01:26.74]When you're not there
[01:32.96]
[02:01.92]It's hard enough being alone
[02:05.69]Sitting here by the phone
[02:09.51]Waiting for my memories
[02:11.97]To come and play
[02:17.18]It's hard enough sitting there
[02:20.93]Rockin' in your rockin' chair
