[00:25.72]Can you hear the drums Fernando?
[00:28.34]I remember long ago another starry night like this
[00:34.82]In the firelight Fernando
[00:41.73]You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
[00:46.98]I could hear the distant drums
[00:49.18]And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
[00:55.17]They were closer now Fernando
[00:59.65]Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
[01:05.97]I was so afraid Fernando
[01:10.72]We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
[01:15.40]And I'm not ashamed to say
[01:18.38]The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
[01:25.05]There was something in the air that night
[01:28.10]The stars were bright, Fernando
[01:33.52]They were shining there for you and me
[01:36.25]For liberty, Fernando
[01:41.51]Though I never thought that we could lose
[01:44.70]There's no regret
[01:56.35][01:46.64]If I had to do the same again
[02:00.48][01:51.78]I would, my friend, Fernando
[02:17.52]Now we're old and grey Fernando
[02:23.93]And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
[02:31.22]Can you hear the drums Fernando?
[02:35.68]Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
[02:40.26]I can see it in your eyes
[02:42.90]How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
[02:48.30]There was something in the air that night
[02:52.39]The stars were bright, Fernando
[02:57.57]They were shining there for you and me
[03:00.69]For liberty, Fernando
[03:05.49]Though I never thought that we could lose
[03:07.96]There's no regret
[03:11.02]If I had to do the same again
[03:15.93]I would, my friend, Fernando
[03:21.50]There was something in the air that night
[03:24.83]The stars were bright, Fernando
[03:30.06]They were shining there for you and me
[03:33.31]For liberty, Fernando
[03:38.25]Though I never thought that we could lose
[03:40.61]There's no regret
[03:42.86]If I had to do the same again
[03:47.96]I would, my friend, Fernando
[03:53.07]Yes, if I had to do the same again
[03:56.30]I would, my friend, Fernando...
