[00:17.50]
[00:18.50]Nobody on the road
[00:20.90]Nobody on the beach
[00:24.48]I feel it in the air
[00:28.82]The summer's out of reach
[00:30.78]Empty lake, empty streets
[00:33.86]The sun goes down alone
[00:39.33]I'm drivin' by your house
[00:41.37]Though I know you're not at home
[00:43.79]
[00:44.12]I can see you
[00:47.31]Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
[00:52.19]You got your hair combed back
[00:54.75]and your sunglasses on, baby
[00:56.91]I can tell you
[01:00.92]my love for you will still be strong
[01:03.51]After the boys of summer have gone
[01:09.40]
[01:16.70]I never will forget those nights
[01:20.25]I wonder if it was a dream
[01:23.70]Remember how you made me crazy?
[01:27.43]Remember how I made you scream
[01:30.71]Now I don't understand what happened to our love
[01:37.54]But babe, I'm gonna get you back
[01:40.85]I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
[01:44.00]
[01:45.00]I can see you
[01:48.11]Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
[01:51.05]I see you walkin' real slow
[01:52.47]and you're smilin' at everyone
[01:56.61]I can tell you
[01:59.47]my love for you will still be strong
[02:02.24]After the boys of summer have gone
[02:08.14]
[02:36.64]Out on the road today,
[02:38.92]I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
[02:43.14]A little voice inside my head said,
[02:46.28]"Don't look back. You can never look back."
[02:49.47]I thought I knew what love was
[02:52.83]What did I know?
[02:56.04]Those days are gone forever
[02:58.67]I should just let them go but
[03:02.85]
[03:05.41]I can see you
[03:07.81]Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
[03:11.67]You got that top pulled down
[03:14.69]and that radio on, baby
[03:18.25]I can tell you
[03:21.15]my love for you will still be strong
[03:24.67]After the boys of summer have gone
[03:30.74]
[03:45.28]I can tell you
[03:47.67]my love for you will still be strong
[03:50.54]After the boys of summer have gone
[03:58.10]
