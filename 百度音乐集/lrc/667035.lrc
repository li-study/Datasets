[00:29.19]The flood is rising
[00:32.81]I’m deep within
[00:35.79]The ground starts sliding now it’s time for me to sink or swim
[00:41.77]Can’t find the shoreline
[00:44.40]God knows I’ve tried
[00:47.45]I’m close to drowning in the ocean
[00:50.75]I cried
[00:52.49]Too late for me to stop this seething tide
[00:57.73]
[00:58.04]I’m out of tears was it worth it?
[01:04.14]No tears to cry over you
[01:10.05]I’m out of tears but you’re still thirsty
[01:16.01]No tears cause I’ve wasted all I had on you
[01:23.49]
[01:35.66]You can’t imagine how bad it hurts
[01:40.76]The fact you sucked the lifeblood off my eyes just to quench your thirst
[01:47.42]I’m going under, you’re high and dry
[01:52.88]Still I’m close to drowning in the ocean
[01:56.63]I cried
[01:58.68]Too late for me to stop this seething tide
[02:03.41]
[02:03.85]I’m out of tears was it worth it?
[02:10.72]No tears to cry over you
[02:16.32]I’m out of tears but you’re still thirsty
[02:22.29]No tears cause I’ve wasted all I had on you
[02:30.07]
[03:20.77]I’m out of tears was it worth it?
[03:26.56]No tears to cry over you
[03:32.46]I’m out of tears but you’re still thirsty
[03:38.88]No tears cause I’ve wasted all I had on you
