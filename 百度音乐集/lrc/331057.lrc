[00:08.00]
[00:12.37]I started a joke, which started the whole world crying,
[00:23.61]but I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no.
[00:38.53]I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing,
[01:36.60][00:48.91]oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.
[01:48.54][01:00.57]I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,
[02:01.12][01:13.00]and I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said.
[01:25.72]'Til I finally died, which started the whole world laughing,
[02:13.71]'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,
[02:30.64]oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was one me.
