[00:01.12]Barry Manilow - Careless Whisper
[00:07.10]
[00:26.91]I feel so unsure
[00:32.82]As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[00:39.83]As the music dies, something in your eyes
[00:45.54]Calls to mind the silver screen
[00:48.54]And all its sad good-byes
[00:52.22]
[00:52.50]I'm never gonna dance again
[00:54.84]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[00:58.38]Though it's easy to pretend
[01:00.98]I know your not a fool
[01:03.67]
[01:04.23]Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[01:07.26]And waste the chance that I've been given
[01:10.81]So I'm never gonna dance again
[01:13.54]The way I danced with you
[01:26.97]
[01:29.58]Time can never mend
[01:35.61]The careless whispers of a good friend
[01:42.43]To the heart and mind
[01:45.36]Ignorance is kind
[01:48.31]There's no comfort in the truth
[01:51.28]Pain is all you'll find
[01:55.06]
[01:55.29]I'm never gonna dance again
[01:57.78]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[02:01.08]Though it's easy to pretend
[02:03.68]I know your not a fool
[02:06.49]
[02:06.92]Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[02:09.94]And waste this chance that I've been given
[02:13.50]So I'm never gonna dance again
[02:16.31]The way I danced with you
[02:22.75]
[02:23.36]Never without your love
[02:28.88]
[02:32.06]Tonight the music seems so loud
[02:35.22]I wish that we could lose this crowd
[02:38.37]Maybe it's better this way
[02:41.55]We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
[02:44.57]
[02:44.79]We could have been so good together
[02:47.85]We could have lived this dance forever
[02:51.05]But no one's gonna dance with me
[02:56.01]Please stay
[02:59.45]
[03:02.19]And I'm never gonna dance again
[03:03.71]Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:07.24]Though it's easy to pretend
[03:09.88]I know your not a fool
[03:13.00]
[03:13.22]Should've known better than to cheat a friend
[03:16.14]And waste the chance that I've been given
[03:19.71]So I'm never gonna dance again
[03:22.43]The way I danced with you
[03:35.69]
