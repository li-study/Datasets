[00:11.55]
[00:22.16]What do you get when you fall in love?
[00:26.50]A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
[00:31.10]That's what you get for all your trouble
[00:35.66]I'll never fall in love again
[00:45.26]I'll never fall in love again
[00:52.90]What do you get when you kiss a guy?
[00:57.13]You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
[01:01.97]After you do, he'll never phone you
[01:06.54]I'll never fall in love again
[01:16.05]I'll never fall in love again
[01:22.15]Don't tell me what is all about
[01:28.16]Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
[01:32.74]Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
[01:37.41]That is why I'm here to remind you
[01:42.88]
[01:44.47]What do you get when you fall in love?
[01:48.80]A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
[01:53.37]That's what you get for your devotion
[01:57.85]I'll never fall in love again
[02:07.14]I'll never fall in love again
[02:10.92]
[02:34.69]What do you get when you fall in love?
[02:39.18]You only get lies and pain and sorrow
[02:43.63]That's what you get for your devotion
[02:48.10]I'll never fall in love again!
[02:57.33]I'll never fall in love again!
[03:08.54]Never fall in love again
[03:14.12]Never fall in love again
