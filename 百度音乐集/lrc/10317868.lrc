[00:04.78]I've been to cities that never close down
[00:11.21]from New York to Rio and old London town,
[00:17.82]but no matter how far or how wide I roam
[00:25.64]I still call Australia home.
[00:31.44]
[00:33.02]I'm always traveling, I love being free,
[00:39.58]and so I keep leaving the sun and the sea,
[00:46.77]but my heart lies waiting over the foam.
[00:55.55]I still call Australia home.
[01:02.03]
[01:06.19]But someday we'll all be together once more
[01:13.14]when all of the ships come back to the shore.
[01:20.52]Then I realise something I've always known.
[01:29.49]I still call Australia home.
[01:35.48]
[01:37.78]All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world,
[01:44.71]away from their family and friends,
[01:51.63]but as the world gets older and colder,
[01:58.95]it's good to know where your journey ends.
[02:05.75]
[02:09.46]But someday we'll all be together once more
[02:16.37]when all of the ships come back to the shore.
[02:23.74]Then I realise something I've always known.
[02:33.15]I still call Australia home.
[03:12.44]All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world,
[03:18.88]away from their family and friends,
[03:25.80]but as the world gets older and colder,
[03:31.66]it's good to know where your journey ends.
[03:39.58]
[03:41.28]But someday we'll all be together once more
[03:50.25]when all of the ships come back to the shore.
[03:57.37]Then I realise something I've always known.
[04:08.14]I still call Australia home.
