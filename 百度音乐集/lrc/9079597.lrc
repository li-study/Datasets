[00:00.00]The Next Life
[00:20.45]See you
[00:24.91]in your next life
[00:30.05]when we'll fly away for good
[00:36.58]
[00:40.65]Stars in our own car
[00:50.24]we can drive away from here
[01:01.10]Far away
[01:05.89]so far away
[01:11.35]down to Worthing and work there
[01:21.36]Far away we'll go far away and flog ice creams
[01:35.37]'til the company's on its knees
[01:41.30]ah...
[02:30.01]see you in your next life
[02:38.56]when we'll fly away for good
