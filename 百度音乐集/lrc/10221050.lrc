[00:38.32]I was tough until I saw her.
[00:42.23]I said "hello" but she just turned away.

[02:05.33]Two silohuets, or private dancer
[02:09.36]Lights go dim as the music starts to fade away.
[02:15.49]Turned and walked away
[02:17.01]I'm the one who needs you
[02:24.97]I'll be there to catch you when you fall.

[03:45.75][03:49.45]Waiting for you
[04:10.62]On the edge of a broken heart...
