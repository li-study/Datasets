[00:09.51]Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings
[00:11.14]
[00:15.42]Dancing like the nights are down in Nashville
[00:21.71]But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run
[00:28.50]I got a call to go to a late night picture show
[00:34.79]So I traded in the darkness and I’m already there
[00:41.01]I’m already there
[00:44.53]
[00:44.93]And I’m trying' to make some friends
[00:49.71]So if you see that movie star and me
[00:56.35]If you see my picture in a magazine
[01:02.94]Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV
[01:09.70]Well honey I’m just tryin' to make some sense outta me
[01:18.62]
[01:31.92]I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco
[01:38.12]And now you wanna say you see through me
[01:45.06]But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me
[01:51.62]So why you turn around tonight
[01:54.05]But I’m already there
[01:57.54]I’m already there
[02:00.07]
[02:00.70]I’m just tryin to make some friends
[02:05.71]So if you see that movie star and me
[02:12.42]If you should see my picture in a magazine
[02:19.10]Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV
[02:25.81]Well honey I’m just trying to make some sense in Los Angeles
[02:36.11]
[02:36.72]Boston gets cold this time of year
[02:42.31]Seems like each day just leaves me numb
[02:48.93]I gotta get out of here
[02:53.56]Go walking in the sun
[02:58.89]
[02:59.47]Well if you see that movie star and me
[03:05.48]Or if you should see my picture in a magazine
[03:12.18]Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV
[03:18.84]But honey I was just trying to make some sense
[03:25.57]Honey I’m just trying to make some friends
[03:31.97]Well baby I’m not trying to make amends
