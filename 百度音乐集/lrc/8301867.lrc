[00:02.00]Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)
[00:10.00]How can I just let you walk away,
[00:13.00]just let you leave without a trace,
[00:18.00]When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
[00:26.00]You're the only one who really knew me at all
[00:35.00]How can you just walk away from me,
[00:39.00]when all I can do is watch you leave
[00:43.00]Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain,
[00:47.00]and even shared the tears,
[00:51.00]You're the only one who really knew me at all
[00:58.00][02:04.00]So take a look at me now,
[01:03.00][02:09.00]there's just an empty space
[01:07.00][02:13.00]And there's nothing left here to remind me,
[01:12.00][02:17.00]just the memory of your face
[01:15.00][02:21.00]Take a look at me now,
[01:20.00][02:25.00]there's just an empty space
[01:25.00]And you coming back to me is against all odds
[01:29.00]and that's what I've got to face
[01:40.00]I wish I could just make you turn around,
[01:44.00]turn around and see me cry
[01:48.00]There's so much I need to say to you,
[01:52.00]so many reasons why
[01:57.00]You're the only one who really knew me at all
[02:30.00]But to wait for you, well that's all I can do
[02:34.00]and that's what I've got to face
[02:37.00]Take a good look at me now,
[02:41.00]'cos I'll still be standing here
[02:46.00]And you coming back to me is against all odds
[02:51.00]That's the chance I've got to take, oh, oho
[03:09.00]Just take a look at me now
