[00:28.62]Time machine, let me into the future
[00:32.38]Ready to forget the past
[00:36.21]Long ago only leads to today
[00:40.19]Soon we'll find we don't know what love is
[00:43.94]Long after you've said goodbye
[00:47.75]I'm getting in to jump time again
[00:52.21]
[00:55.76]Take this heart that I'll have no use for
[00:59.82]In a moment, I'll be gone
[01:03.00]The place we are, around a dying star
[01:06.65]One day we'll run from this dying sun
[01:10.41]
[01:11.18]Alone again looking out through my window
[01:14.72]Seasons flying past till they blur
[01:18.69]Blotting out the colors of the world
[01:23.23]Blotting out the colors of the world
[01:26.59]Birth and death and laugh and cry (smile)
[01:30.25]The years are flying by
[01:34.01]Far beyond our dears, our tears (smile)
[01:38.70]The years are flying by
[01:44.18]The years are flying by
[01:46.29]
[02:04.85]I'll only want you more
[02:11.17]If I can touch you
[02:20.15]I'll only want you more
[02:26.53]If I can touch you
