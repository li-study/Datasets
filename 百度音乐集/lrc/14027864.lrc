[00:00.08]All Time Low - Come One, Come All
[00:00.38]by鲍鱼
[00:00.58]
[00:00.67]Come one, come all
[00:01.58]You're just in time
[00:03.03]To witness my first breakdown
[00:05.52]Cause there's a mile gone
[00:07.13]For every minute passed
[00:08.78]When I'm stuck in this town
[00:13.00]
[00:24.27]I've got a bone to pick with you, Mr. DJ
[00:29.26]The traffic and the sound
[00:31.31]Is just as bad as it is in LA
[00:35.10]
[00:35.20]So go on and lock me up
[00:37.57]You better throw away that key
[00:40.36]Before I find out where you broadcast from
[00:43.56]Because your play list is killing me
[00:46.05]
[00:47.42]I'll change that station
[00:49.77]Light it up like the 4th of July
[00:52.21]It's me, I'm caller fifteen
[00:54.83]Time to play my last request
[00:57.57]
[00:58.61]Come one, come all
[00:59.59]You're just in time
[01:01.18]To witness my first breakdown
[01:03.58]Cause there's a mile gone
[01:05.00]For every minute passed
[01:06.80]When I'm wasting space in this town
[01:10.62]Don't call the doctors
[01:12.01]I don't need no medication
[01:15.02]I just need one more vacation
[01:18.54]And make it last
[01:21.83]
[01:21.93]Hear me out, please, judge and jury
[01:25.28]I'm an innocent man
[01:28.19]And it would be such a terrible injustice
[01:31.01]To put me away without thinking about
[01:33.67]All the terrible mistakes
[01:36.08]That goddamn radio jockey makes
[01:38.65]I swear he's out to get me
[01:41.52]Oh, I swear he's out to get me
[01:44.61]
[01:44.71]I'll change that station
[01:47.93]Light it up like the 4th of July
[01:50.56]It's me, I'm caller fifteen
[01:53.02]But it's too late for explanations
[01:56.08]This broadcast will be your last
[01:59.40]
[01:59.44]Come one, come all
[02:00.75]You're just in time
[02:02.25]To witness my first breakdown
[02:04.58]Cause there's a mile gone
[02:06.35]For every minute passed
[02:07.84]When I'm wasting space in this town
[02:11.36]Don't call the doctors
[02:13.36]I don't need no medication
[02:16.10]I just need one more vacation
[02:19.56]And make it last
[02:22.97]
[02:25.05]Hear me out, please, judge and jury
[02:31.17]And I swear he's out to get me
[02:34.12]Oh, I swear he's out to get me
[02:37.24]Go on and lock me up
[02:40.11]You better throw away that key
[02:42.59]I swear he's out to get me
[02:45.68]I swear he's out to get me
[02:48.79]
[02:50.00]I've got a bone to pick with you, Mr. DJ
[02:54.62]You really ought to lock me up
[02:57.52]Because your play list is killing me
[03:00.43]
[03:00.53]Come one, come all
[03:01.71]You're just in time
[03:03.39]To witness my first breakdown
[03:05.87]Cause there's a mile gone
[03:07.44]For every minute passed
[03:09.00]When I'm wasting space in this town
[03:12.57]Don't call the doctors
[03:14.44]I don't need no medication
[03:17.16]I just need one more vacation
[03:20.69]And make it last
