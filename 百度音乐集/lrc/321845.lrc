[00:07.68]
[00:15.86]You held my hand and then you slipped away
[00:22.41]And I may never see your face again
[00:29.04]So tell me how do to fill the emptiness inside
[00:34.37]Without love, what is life?
[00:39.89]
[00:42.46]And anyone who knew us both can see
[00:48.59]We always were the better part of me
[00:55.59]I never wanted to be this free
[01:00.67]All this pain, does it go away?
[01:06.04]
[01:08.91]Then every time I turn around
[01:15.54]And you're nowhere to be found
[01:19.05]I know I got a long, long way to go
[01:26.18]Before I can say goodbye to you
[01:32.77]Oh, I got a long, long way to go
[01:39.54]Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew
[01:47.16]To you, to you
[01:57.48]
[02:01.95]From memory, there is no hiding place
[02:08.32]Turn on the TV and I see you there
[02:15.25]In every crowd there's always someone with your face
[02:20.48]Everywhere, trying not to care
[02:26.14]
[02:28.49]Then every time I turn around
[02:34.98]And you're nowhere to be found
[02:38.60]I know I got a long, long way to go
[02:45.75]Before I can say goodbye to you
[02:52.42]Oh, I got a long, long way to go
[02:59.06]Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew
[03:05.40]
[03:06.97]To you, I wish you everythin'
[03:10.78]And all the best that life can bring
[03:14.07]I only hope you think of me sometimes, oh
[03:20.42]And even though I feel the pain
[03:24.50]I know that I will love again
[03:27.38]The time will come, oh, and I'll move on
[03:33.53]I got a long, long way to go
[03:38.81]Before I can say goodbye to you
[03:45.41]Oh, I got a long, long way to go, got a long way to go
[03:52.14]Before I can say goodbye, before I say goodbye
[03:55.84]To all I ever knew, to all I ever knew
[03:59.97]I got a long, I got a long, long way to go, long way to go
[04:05.58]Before I can say, before I say, goodbye to you
[04:11.13]Say goodbye, say goodbye
[04:13.38]Oh, I got a long, long way to go
[04:18.82]Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew
[04:27.53]
