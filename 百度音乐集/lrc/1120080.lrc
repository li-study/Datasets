[02:22.95][00:49.91]Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
[02:24.74][00:52.20]Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
[02:26.71][00:54.25]Reports come in of the heavy attack,
[02:28.82][00:56.39]Message is seen, we're moving back.
[02:30.61][00:58.54]
[01:00.18]Preparations are made for the journey back,
[01:06.54]It's a survival, supplies are packed.
[01:08.79]No more nights in this eternal hell,
[01:10.54]Destination is simple, we move out.
[01:12.88]
[02:46.31][01:49.44][01:14.74]Killing time - You left from the line
[02:47.72][01:51.55][01:16.88]. Killing time - Your turn to kill.
[02:50.52][01:53.63][01:18.89]Killing time - What do you say?
[02:52.52][01:55.59][01:20.79]Killing time - Aaha, killing time.
[02:56.29][01:57.73][01:22.14]
[02:35.93][01:24.85]And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
[02:38.09][01:26.54]No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
[02:40.15][01:28.61]Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
[02:42.01][01:30.74]Nasty word, he'll take your life.
[02:44.28][01:32.81]
[01:34.26]The silence is over, they attack again,
[01:40.99]Killing and hatred drive me insane.
[01:43.22]Reports come in of a heavy attack,
[01:45.92]Message is seen, we're moving back.
