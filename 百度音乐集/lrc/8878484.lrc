[00:00.00]To Die For - Mary-Ann (R.I.P.)
[00:01.00]
[00:33.88]Silence fills the room
[00:39.22]calmness is complete
[00:45.21]misery is fading away from her face
[00:53.07]her restless soul
[00:57.45]is forever gone
[01:05.00]always running away from here
[01:10.74]she left me alone
[01:15.29]
[01:46.36]She left me her warmth
[01:51.44]for the cold days ahead
[01:58.66]down pours the rain to wash away
[02:05.02]the lust of life
[02:08.72]
