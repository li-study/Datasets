[00:06.85]Chloe Agnew--Someday
[00:08.45]
[00:09.09]Someday
[00:12.34]When we are wiser
[00:16.26]When the world's older
[00:20.51]When we have learned
[00:26.29]I pray
[00:29.54]Someday we may yet live
[00:34.15]To live and let live
[00:42.53]
[00:43.14]Someday
[00:47.00]Life will be fairer
[00:51.04]Need will be rarer
[00:55.05]And greed will not pay
[01:00.32]God speed
[01:03.85]This bright millennium
[01:09.12]On its way
[01:13.49]Let it come
[01:17.73]Someday
[01:24.24]Oh...
[01:26.20]
[01:26.88]Someday
[01:30.14]Our fight will be won then
[01:34.58]We'll stand in the sun then
[01:38.69]That bright afternoon
[01:44.70]Till then
[01:47.19]On days when the sun is gone
[01:52.52]We'll hang on
[01:56.30]If we wish upon the moon
[02:04.09]
[02:05.93]There are some days dark and bitter
[02:10.73]Seems we haven't got a prayer
[02:14.27]But a prayer for something better
[02:18.52]Is the one thing we all share
[02:22.71]
[02:23.82]Someday
[02:27.03]When we are wiser
[02:31.18]When the whole world is older
[02:35.47]When we have learned
[02:40.93]and I pray
[02:45.03]Someday we may yet live
[02:49.57]To live and let live
[02:56.64]One day, someday
[03:01.26]
[03:02.02]Someday
[03:02.81]Life will be fairer
[03:06.11]Need will be rarer
[03:10.59]Greed will not pay
[03:15.94]God speed
[03:19.19]This bright millennium
[03:24.50]Let it come
[03:28.02]If we wish upon the moon
[03:37.11]One day
[03:39.79]Someday
[03:45.31]Soon
[04:00.15]Someday
[04:03.67]Soon
