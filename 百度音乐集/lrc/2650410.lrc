[00:24.89]
[00:27.55]We skipped the light Fandango
[00:33.96]And turned cartwheels across the floor
[00:40.57]I was feeling kind of seasick
[00:47.09]But the crowd called out for more
[00:53.55]The room was humming harder
[00:59.81]As the ceiling flew away
[01:06.37]When we called out for another drink
[01:13.09]The waiter brought a tray
[01:16.30]
[01:16.75]And so it was that later
[01:25.96]As the miller told his tale
[01:32.18]That her face at first just ghostly
[01:36.78]Turned a whiter shade of pale
[01:44.55]
[01:45.50]She said "There is no reason...
[01:51.91]And the truth is plain to see"
[01:58.23]But I wandered through my playing cards
[02:04.74]And would not let her be
[02:11.25]One of sixteen vestal virgins
[02:17.82]Who were leaving for the coast
[02:24.13]And although my eyes were open
[02:30.64]They might just as well have been closed
[02:34.10]
[02:34.50]And so it was that later
[02:43.72]As the miller told his tale
[02:50.23]That her face at first just ghostly
[02:54.94]Turned a whiter shade of pale
