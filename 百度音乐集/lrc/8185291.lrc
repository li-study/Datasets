[00:01.12]Mark Knopfler - Get Lucky
[00:05.89]
[00:22.71]I'm better with my muscles
[00:26.16]Than I am with my mouth
[00:28.21]I'll work the fairgrounds in the summer
[00:31.29]Or go pick fruit down south
[00:35.68]And when I feel them chilly winds
[00:38.15]Where the weather goes I'll follow
[00:41.67]Pack up my travelling things
[00:44.45]Go with the swallows
[00:47.40]And I might get lucky now and then - you win some
[00:56.10]I might get lucky now and then - you win some
[01:03.32]
[01:24.90]I wake up every morning
[01:27.35]Keep an eye on what I spent
[01:30.86]Got to think about eating
[01:32.95]Got to think about paying the rent
[01:37.51]I always think it's funny
[01:40.27]Gets me every time
[01:42.80]The one about happiness and money
[01:45.89]Tell it to the bread line
[01:49.18]But you might get lucky now and then you win some
[01:57.86]You might get lucky now and then yeah, you win some
[02:05.95]
[02:54.19]Now I'm rambling through this meadow
[02:57.59]Happy as a man can be
[03:00.32]Think I'll just lay me down
[03:03.57]Under this old tree
[03:06.41]On and on we go
[03:08.70]Through this old world a' shuffling
[03:11.66]If you've got a truffle dog
[03:14.81]You can go truffling
[03:17.57]And you might get lucky now and then -you win some
[03:26.49]You might get lucky now and then yeah, you win some
[03:40.52]
