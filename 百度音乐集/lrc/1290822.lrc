[00:02.52]Set The Fire To The Third Bar
[00:04.36]Snow Patrol
[00:07.29]
[00:11.13]I find the map and draw a straight line
[00:16.88]Over rivers, farms, and state lines
[00:21.55]The distance from here to where you'd be
[00:26.51]It's only finger-lengths that I see
[00:31.27]I touch the place where I'd find your face
[00:41.21]My finger in creases of distant dark places
[00:50.20]
[00:51.22]I hang my coat up in the first bar
[00:56.40]There is no peace that I've found so far
[01:01.30]The laughter penetrates my silence
[01:05.95]As drunken men find flaws in science
[01:10.27]
[01:11.38]Their words mostly noises
[01:15.29]Ghosts with just voices
[01:21.25]Your words in my memory
[01:26.29]Are like music to me
[01:29.50]
[01:31.19]I'm miles from where you are,
[01:35.03]I lay down on the cold ground
[01:40.42]I, I pray that something picks me up
[01:44.31]And sets me down in your warm arms
[01:49.79]
[01:53.63]After I have travelled so far
[01:58.62]We'd set the fire to the third bar
[02:02.81]We'd share each other like an island
[02:08.49]Until exhausted, close our eyelids
[02:13.59]And dreaming, pick up from
[02:18.44]The last place we left off
[02:23.55]Your soft skin is weeping
[02:28.03]A joy you can't keep in
[02:32.66]
[02:33.64]I'm miles from where you are,
[02:37.12]I lay down on the cold ground
[02:42.51]And I, I pray that something picks me up
[02:47.11]and sets me down in your warm arms
[02:52.59]
[02:54.11]And miles from where you are,
[02:57.50]I lay down on the cold gound
[03:02.52]and I, I pray that something picks me up
[03:08.01]and sets me down in your warm arms
[03:13.96]
