[00:18.85]
[00:20.85]There's always something in the way
[00:27.25]There's always something getting through
[00:31.79]But it's not me
[00:35.72]It's You
[00:38.67]It's You
[00:41.67]
[00:43.49]Sometime's ignorance
[00:45.44]Rings true

[01:13.17]It's all I know
[01:19.34]It's all I know
[01:23.68]
[01:25.55]And I find peace when I'm confused
[01:31.98]I find hope when I'm let down
[01:36.48]Not in me, Me,
[01:40.02]In You
[01:43.22]In You
[01:45.54]
[01:48.15]I hope to lose myself for good
[01:54.51]I hope to find it in the end
[01:58.76]Not in me Me,
[02:02.74]In You
[02:05.82]In You
[02:08.15]
[02:11.12]It's all I know
