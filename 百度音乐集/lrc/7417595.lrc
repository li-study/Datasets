[00:13.15]I have fallen, I have stood up,
[00:18.76]I've had the patience of a tree
[00:24.49]You have trembled, you have stayed still,
[00:30.25]you have tumbled like a weed
[00:35.71]All the mountains, all the deserts,
[00:41.38]go for miles and miles around
[00:47.03]We have driven for years now, baby,
[00:52.69]just to get back to a place we had already found
[00:58.34]Now you're driving me downtown, baby, on a rainy night
[01:09.27]You're driving me crazy, baby, is this really life?
[01:19.66]In the wildest times of the world
[01:25.06]Oh I never thought I would be here with you tonight
[01:30.83]In the wildest times of the world
[01:36.34]Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life
[01:43.42]I was mistaken our love was forsaken,
[01:49.25]worst mistake I ever made
[01:54.97]Were you lonely, were you brave, now?
[02:00.54]I guess the two are one and the same
[02:06.27]Now I'm singing here with my sweet, sweet darling in my eye
[02:17.64]Ain't it funny how you're walking through life and it turns on a dime?
[02:28.72]I was missing you crazy, baby, are you really mine?
[02:39.00]In the wildest times of the world
[02:44.84]Oh I never thought I would be here with you tonight
[02:50.23]In the wildest times of the world
[02:55.49]Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life
[03:02.00]In the wildest times of the world
[03:07.71]Oh I never thought I would be here with you tonight
[03:13.53]In the wildest times of the world
[03:18.95]Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life
[04:44.12][04:32.71][04:21.89][04:09.99][03:26.48]Hey Hey Hey...
[04:36.40][04:14.59][04:03.09]Tell me is this really life
