[00:07.36]作詞∶Marius De Vries
[00:13.36]作曲∶Marius De Vries、萨顶顶
[00:23.36]演唱：萨顶顶
[00:33.36]
[00:35.86]It's cold outside
[00:39.12]And a silver cloud hangs low over the morning skyline
[00:44.65]There is no sound other than my heartbeat
[00:49.01]And snowflakes dance like fireflies
[00:54.15]In the distance a billboard shines through the mist
[00:58.33]And on it  I can read  my name
[01:02.48]And a short
[01:03.54]Message:
[01:04.97]"To live outside of time is to be free"
[01:08.39]"Have a nice day"
[01:10.25]
[01:18.14]Traffic is heavy
[01:19.89]And rain has fallen on the city
[01:23.61]To one side of me , I hear a voice
[01:27.12]It is a man without a face
[01:29.38]And he has a book
[01:31.04]Written in a language I cannot understand
[01:35.02]Seventeen people
[01:36.52]enter the white building at the same time
[01:39.77]And the clock has stopped at nine
[01:43.73]On the elevator wall is written:
[01:46.81]"Only love can set you free"
[01:49.57]"This is your lucky day"
[01:51.78]
[01:58.01]AND SO I SAY TO MYSELF
[02:04.65]MAYBE THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
[02:13.31]MAYBE THIS IS THE MOMENT
[02:20.06]MAYBE THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FREE
[02:25.96]
[02:34.82]Time itself is frozen
[02:37.57]Somewhere a telephone is ringing
[02:41.27]Is that for me ?  Can that be for me ?
[02:43.10]There IS a voice there
[02:45.04]And it's one I've heard before
[02:47.42]Could have been a dream - or at least
[02:50.25]Another place,another time
[02:52.85]Perhaps we can rendezvous ?
[02:55.31]Put a name to a face
[02:56.98]Or a face to a name ?
[02:59.22]But already I know what it is he has to say:
[03:03.94]"Only by leaving can you truly arrive"
[03:07.43]HAVE A NICE DAY!
[03:08.98]
[03:14.49]AND SO I SAY TO MYSELF
[03:22.18]MAYBE THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
[03:30.07]MAYBE THIS IS THE MOMENT
[03:37.54]MAYBE THIS WILL BE MY LUCKY DAY
[03:43.24]
[04:33.65]It's cold outside
[04:36.39]And a silver cloud hangs low over the morning skyline
[04:42.21]There is no sound other than my heartbeat
[04:46.48]And snowflakes dance like fireflies
[04:51.85]
