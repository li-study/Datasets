[00:00.45]Send me offshore
[00:03.48]It's a cold blooded war
[00:07.72]I can't win, I give in, I give in
[00:15.95]In the field of my fight
[00:19.86]We can wonder all night
[00:23.77]Why we have all this love, all this love
[00:32.03]You and I
[00:33.99]We were drawn
[00:36.13]In the break of my dawn
[00:39.09]With the boreal wind
[00:44.20]Where begin is begin
[00:48.25]But we can't change the world
[00:52.31]No we can't change the world
[00:56.51]It's been done
[00:58.39]By someone
[01:00.47]Long ago
[01:02.01]
[01:05.78]Send me offshore
[01:09.07]There's a bright semaphore
[01:12.41]Calling in every wind, every wind
[01:20.80]In the loop of my game
[01:24.61]There's a whole life to blame
[01:28.71]It's been done
[01:30.64]But we won what we won
[01:35.14]
[01:37.08]You and I, we both run
[01:41.11]With an unloaded gun
[01:44.96]For the same piece of land
[01:49.33]Where no endings end
[01:53.03]But we can't change the world
[01:57.57]No we can't change the world
[02:01.68]It's been done
[02:03.48]By someone
[02:05.59]Long ago
[02:09.22]
[02:42.51]You and I, we both run
[02:46.70]With an unloaded gun
[02:50.41]For the same piece of land
[02:54.64]Where no endings end
[02:57.96]But we can't change the world
[03:02.80]No we can't change the world
[03:06.82]It's been done
[03:08.71]By someone
[03:10.77]Long ago
[03:14.56]
[03:15.86]Send me offshore
[03:19.05]She is a cold blooded war
[03:23.13]I can't win, I give in, I give in
