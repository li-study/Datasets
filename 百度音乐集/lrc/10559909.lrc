[00:10.53]Title: Time After Time
[00:14.95]lying in my bed i hear the clock tick,
[00:19.51]And think of you
[00:21.71]Caught up in circles confusion
[00:26.52]Is nothing new
[00:29.14]Flashback warm nights
[00:32.90]Almost left behind
[00:36.41]Suitcases of memories,
[00:40.52]Time after
[00:42.09]Sometimes you picture me
[00:45.16]I'm walking too far ahead
[00:49.44]You're calling to me, i can't hear
[00:54.45]What you've said
[00:56.55]Then you say go slow
[01:00.23]I fall behind
[01:04.08]The second hand unwinds
[01:07.75]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[01:12.13]Time after time
[01:14.66]If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
[01:19.39]Time after time
[01:22.10]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[01:26.74]Time after time
[01:29.27]If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
[01:33.91]Time after time
[01:52.24]After my picture fades and darkness has
[01:57.23]Turned to gray
[01:59.41]Watching through windows you're wondering
[02:03.87]If i'm ok
[02:06.59]Secrets stolen from deep inside
[02:14.37]The drum beats out of time
[02:17.26]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[02:21.90]Time after time
[02:24.52]If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
[02:29.25]Time after time
[02:47.32]You said go slow
[02:51.43]I fall behind
[02:55.19]The second hand unwinds
[02:58.25]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[03:02.46]Time after time
[03:05.17]If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
[03:09.80]Time after time
[03:12.43]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[03:17.15]Time after time
[03:19.70]If you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting
[03:24.51]Time after time
[03:28.35]Time after time
[03:32.12]Time after time
[03:35.53]Time after time
