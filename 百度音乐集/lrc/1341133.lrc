[00:00.00]Eric Benet - My Prayer
[00:33.47]
[00:35.47]I don't want to live this way no more
[00:43.27]I don't want to fight this endless lonely war
[00:51.34]I don't want to stand alone,
[00:55.07]without the only love I've known
[00:57.68]And never find that ray of light we had before
[01:04.64]
[01:07.04]I never meant to break your precious heart
[01:14.89]And what I did can't be undone and it's tearing me apart
[01:22.94]Far too late for promises,
[01:26.89]but if you gave us one more chance
[01:29.74]You would see a better man worth fighting for
[01:35.90]
[01:38.15]Love sweet love I feel your power
[01:45.89]Hear my prayer, we're in your hands now
[01:53.98]Take these hearts so lost and broken
[02:02.34]Bring us home again
[02:08.86]
[02:10.94]If this prayer for love is never heard
[02:16.25]Oh, and if you have to walk away for these are only words
[02:26.75]Baby I will understand but I will always be that man
[02:33.42]Waiting here for you with love and open arms
[02:39.96]
[02:41.96]Love sweet love I feel your power
[02:49.88]Hear my prayer, we're in your hands now
[02:57.71]Take these hearts so lost and broken
[03:05.35]Bring us home again
[03:10.47]Remember all the times we had,
[03:13.40]the dreams that we once shared
[03:18.43]I swear I'll bring them back to you again
[03:24.20]Again
[03:29.82]
[03:53.55]Love sweet love I feel your power
[04:01.46]Hear my prayer, we're in your hands now
[04:09.35]Take these hearts so lost and broken
[04:17.23]Bring us home again
[04:24.78]And bring us home again
[04:36.46]
