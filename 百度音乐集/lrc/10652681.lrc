[02:15.00][00:09.00]Blue moon,
[02:17.00][00:12.00]you saw me standing alone
[02:20.00][00:16.00]without a dream in my heart
[02:24.00][00:20.00]without a love on my own.
[02:29.00][00:25.00]Blue moon,
[02:32.00][00:28.00]you knew just what I was there for
[02:36.00][00:32.00]you heard me saying a prayer for
[02:40.00][00:36.00]somebody I realy could care for.
[02:44.00][00:41.00]And then there suddenly appeared before me,
[02:48.00][00:45.00]the only one my arms will ever hold
[02:52.00][00:49.00]I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me."
[02:56.00][00:53.00]and when I looked,
[02:57.00][00:54.00]the moon had turned to gold.
[03:00.00][00:57.00]Blue moon,
[03:03.00][00:59.00]now I'm lo longer alone
[03:07.00][01:04.00]without a dream in my heart
[03:10.00][01:08.00]without a love on my own.
