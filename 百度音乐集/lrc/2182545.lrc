[00:-0.50]It's like your a drug

[00:03.06]0It's like your a demon I can't face down
[00:06.90]It's like I'm stuck
[00:10.06]It's like I'm running from you all the time
[00:42.98][00:13.98]And I know I let you have all the power
[00:21.16]It's like the only company I seek is misery all around
[00:28.66]It's like your a leech
[00:32.87]Sucking the life from me
[03:08.69][02:02.24][00:57.23][00:35.77]It's like I can't breathe
[00:39.14]Without you inside of me
[00:50.14]And I realize I'm never gonna quit you over time
[03:12.33][02:05.82][01:00.93]It's like I can't see anything
[03:15.80][02:09.29][01:04.42]Nothing but you
[03:19.40][02:13.35][01:08.40]I'm addicted to you
[03:22.99][02:16.48][01:11.46]It's like I can't think
[03:26.39][02:19.87][01:14.98]Without you interrupting me
[03:30.18][02:23.64][01:18.83]In my thoughts, in my dreams
[03:34.62][02:27.95][01:22.92]You've taken over me
[03:40.64][03:37.47][02:34.43][02:30.94][01:29.25][01:25.93]It's like I'm not me
[01:33.21]It's like I'm lost
[01:36.77]It's like I'm giving up slowly
[01:40.53]It's like your a ghost that's haunting me
[01:44.84]Leave me alone
[01:47.46]And I know these voices in my head are mine alone
[01:54.70]And I know I'll never change my ways if I don't give you up now
[02:53.40][02:38.39]I'm hooked on you
[02:54.54][02:40.00]I need a fix
[02:55.76][02:41.01]I can't take it
[02:56.77][02:42.60]Just one more hit
[02:57.79][02:43.53]I promise I can deal with it
[03:00.34][02:46.09]I'll handle it, quit it
[03:02.13][02:47.75]Just one more time, then that's it
[03:04.05][02:49.50]Just a little bit more to get me through this
