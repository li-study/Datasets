[00:15.19]献给我最爱的女生...祝愿她能永远幸福
[00:17.07]Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
[00:20.40]All through their high school days
[00:23.38]Both members of the 4H Club
[00:28.16]Both active in the FFA
[00:32.47]After graduation Mary Anne went out
[00:35.43]lookin\' for a bright new world
[00:39.04]Wanda looked all around this town
[00:43.28]and all she found was Earl
[00:48.48]Well it wasn\'t two weeks  after she got married
[00:53.41]that Wanda started gettin\' abused
[00:56.45]She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
[01:01.03]And make-up to cover a bruise
[01:04.19]Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
[01:09.08]She let the law take it from there
[01:12.00]But Earl walked right through that restraining order
[01:16.79]And put her in intensive care
[01:22.08]Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atalnta
[01:26.25]On a red eye midnight flight
[01:29.79]She held Wanda\'s hand
[01:32.23]as they worked out a plan  And it didn\'t take long to decided
[01:37.20]That Earl had to die
[01:41.86]Goodbye Earl
[01:45.62]Those black-eyed peas
[01:49.00]They tasted all right to me
[01:50.94]Why don\'t you lay down and sleep Earl
[02:01.29]Ain\'t it dark
[02:04.40]Wrapped up in that tarp Earl
[02:13.63]The cops came to bring Earl in
[02:17.37]They searched the house high and low
[02:19.83]Then they tipped their hats
[02:22.73]and said \"Thank You ladies if you hear from him let us know\"
[02:29.18]Well the weeks went by
[02:31.09]and Spring turned to Summer
[02:32.84]And Summer faded into Fall
[02:35.83]And it turns out he was a missing person
[02:40.52]who nobody missed at all
[02:45.94]So the girls bouth some land
[02:48.34]and a roadside stand
[02:50.04]Out on Highway 109
[02:53.17]They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jame
[02:58.07]And they don\'t lose any sleep at night
[03:00.86]\'cause Earl had to die
[03:05.27]Goodbye Earl
[03:09.26]We need a break
[03:12.82]Let\'s go out to the lake Earl
[03:17.26]We\'ll pack a lunch
[03:20.71]And stuff you in the trunk Earl
[03:24.99]Well is that all right
[03:28.16]Good Let\'s go for a ride
[03:30.72]Earl hey
