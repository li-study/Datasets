[00:00.00]Charlotte Church - Dream a Dream (Elysium)
[00:15.13]
[00:19.13]When the night is still
[00:22.69]And the sea is calm
[00:25.80]Lonely shadow, you fall upon me
[00:33.05]
[00:33.67]Lay by my side
[00:37.34]Fear not tonight
[00:40.13]Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light
[00:48.03]
[00:48.45]Dream a dream
[00:51.87]And see through angel's eyes
[00:55.52]A place where we can fly away
[01:02.31]
[01:03.07]Ride with me upon a shining star,
[01:10.19]Above the moonlit sky
[01:13.63]We will find Elysium
[01:22.20]
[01:32.61]Hear the nightingale
[01:36.10]Sing a lullaby
[01:39.08]Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light
[01:46.75]
[01:47.19]Dawn will be kind,
[01:50.83]All will be bright,
[01:53.58]Lonely shadow, rise from the darkness
[02:01.50]
[02:01.91]Dream a dream
[02:05.49]And see through Angels's eyes
[02:09.08]A place where we can fly away
[02:15.23]
[02:16.70]Ride with me upon a shining star,
[02:23.74]Above the moonlit sky once more
[02:45.66][02:31.05]We dream a dream
[02:49.44][02:34.75]And see through Angels's eyes
[02:53.16][02:38.51]A place where we can fly away
[02:45.21]
