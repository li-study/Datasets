[00:05.86]Title: Seven Days
[00:07.29]By Edison
[00:14.46]Seven days, was all she wrote
[00:17.30]A kind of ultimatum note, she gave to me
[00:23.38]She gave to me
[00:27.27]When I thought the field had cleared
[00:29.75]It seems another suit appeared to challenge me
[00:37.75]Woe is me
[00:40.25]Though I hate to make a choice
[00:42.80]My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
[00:49.45]Well, we'll see
[00:53.15]I don't think she'd bluff this time
[00:55.92]I really have to make her mine
[00:58.96]It's plain to see, it's him or me
[01:05.74]Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
[01:10.42]If I make up my mind
[01:14.52]Wedn'sday would be fine
[01:17.02]Thursday's on my mind
[01:19.88]Friday'd give me time
[01:23.57]Saturday could wait
[01:26.70]But Sunday'd be too late
[01:30.62]
[01:35.68]The fact he's over six feet ten
[01:37.93]Might instil fear in other men
[01:41.23]But not in me
[01:44.89]The mighty flea
[01:48.29]Ask if I am mouse or man
[01:50.90]The mirror squeaked, away I ran
[01:54.17]He'll murder me in time for his tea
[02:01.52]Does it bother me at all?
[02:03.75]My rival is Neanderthal
[02:06.93]
[02:07.55]It makes me think
[02:10.58]Perhaps I need a drink
[02:14.15]I.Q. is no problem here
[02:16.82]We won't be playing Scrabble for
[02:20.54]Her hand, I fear
[02:23.59]I need that beer
[02:24.98]
[02:26.91]Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
[02:31.61]If I make up my mind
[02:34.63]Wedn'sday would be fine
[02:38.78]Thursday's on my mind
[02:41.22]Friday'd give me time
[02:44.48]Saturday could wait
[02:47.87]But Sunday'd be too late
[02:50.60]
[02:57.49]Seven days will quickly go
[03:03.92]The fact remains, I love her so
[03:10.44]Seven days
[03:13.72]So many ways
[03:17.18]But I can't run away
[03:19.04]I can't run away
[03:27.10]
[03:31.97]Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
[03:36.55]If I make up my mind
[03:40.01]Wedn'sday would be fine
[03:43.63]Thursday's on my mind
[03:46.51]Friday'd give me time
[03:49.45]Saturday could wait
[03:52.61]But Sunday'd be too late
[04:08.60]Do I have to tell a story
[04:11.51]Of a thousand rainy days
[04:14.05]Since we first met?
[04:21.48]It's a big enough umbrella
[04:24.62]But it's always me that ends up
[04:28.82]Getting wet. Yeah, Yeah.
