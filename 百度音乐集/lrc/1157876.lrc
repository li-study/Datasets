[00:07.00]she bangs
[00:34.27]Talk to me
[00:35.97]Tell me your name
[00:37.76]You blow me off like it's all the same
[00:41.09]You lit a fuse and now I'm ticking away
[00:43.84]Like a bomb
[00:45.26]Yeah, Baby
[00:46.73]
[00:47.58]Talk to me
[00:49.10]Tell me your sign
[00:51.25]You're switching sides like a Gemini
[00:54.46]You're playing games and now you're hittin' my
[00:57.17]heart
[00:57.44]Like a drum
[00:58.37]Yeah, Baby
[00:59.41]
[01:00.38]Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
[01:03.45]We're gonna rock this town alive
[01:07.27]I'll let her rough me up
[01:09.34]Till she knocks me out
[01:10.93]She walks like she talks,
[01:12.43]And she talks like she walks
[01:13.29]
[01:13.96]And she bangs, she bangs
[01:15.95]Oh baby
[01:17.18]When she moves, she moves
[01:19.31]I go crazy
[01:20.20]'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings
[01:23.02]like a bee
[01:24.32]Like every girl in history
[01:27.14]She bangs, she bangs
[01:28.22]
[01:29.13]I'm wasted by the way she moves
[01:34.11]No one ever looked so fine
[01:36.28]She reminds me that a woman only got one thing on her mind
[01:39.60]
[01:44.31]Talk to me
[01:45.65]Tell me your name
[01:47.66]I'm just a link in your daisy chain
[01:51.34]Your rap sounds like a diamond
[01:53.50]Map to the stars
[01:55.04]Yeah, Baby
[01:56.17]
[01:56.59]Talk to me
[01:58.92]Tell me the news
[02:00.76]You wear me out like a pair of shoes
[02:04.24]We'll dance until the band goes home
[02:06.75]Then you're gone
[02:08.36]Yeah, Baby
[02:09.33]
[02:10.16]Well if it looks like love should be a crime
[02:13.36]You'd better lock me up for life
[02:16.99]I'll do the time with a smile on my face
[02:20.35]Thinking of her in her leather and lace
[02:24.12]Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
