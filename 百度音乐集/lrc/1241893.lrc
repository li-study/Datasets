[00:19.50]Is my skin untouchable?
[00:22.59]Am I unlovable?
[00:25.88]Cynical, jaded, faithless, disappointed, disillusioned, used
[00:29.73]If I could take back all my sweat, my tears, my sex, my joy I would
[00:33.16]My time, my love, my effort, passion, dedication
[00:35.90]In case of mistaken identity I gave these things to you
[00:39.25]If I sound angry, bitter, sad, infatuated, it's the truth
[00:42.57]Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, just a few
[00:45.76]Stages of acceptance that it's really over
[00:48.64]It's just so complicated and I'm stupid for believing in you

[01:20.74]It was not reciprocated, you kept affection and yourself apart
[01:24.02]You fed your love to me like crumbs to pigeons in the park
[01:27.35]Sometimes I think you're satisfied to see me begging like a dog
[01:30.38]I wasn't armoured, you were king, I gave my everything
[01:33.69]Because sometimes you showed me just a hint of you and then
[01:36.98]For just a moment I romanticised the notion
[01:40.11]I can take away the torment, I can love you like they never did
[01:43.26]You make me feel like my father never loved me (you never loved me)
