[00:17.80]
[00:19.31]The mouths of envious
[00:21.56]Always find another door
[00:23.77]While at the gates of paradise
[00:25.94]They beat us down some more
[00:28.18]But our mission's set in stone
[00:30.29]'Cause the writing's on the wall
[00:32.70]I'll scream it from the mountain tops
[00:35.00]Pride comes before the fall
[00:37.95]
[00:46.40]So many thoughts to share
[00:48.62]All this energy to give
[00:50.84]Unlike those who hide the truth I tell it like it is
[00:55.70]If the truth will set you free
[00:57.85]I feel sorry for your soul
[01:00.22]Can't you hear the ringing
[01:02.04]'Cause for you the bell tolls
[02:12.47][01:04.53]I'm just a freedom fighter
[02:14.06][01:05.91]No remorse
[02:15.09][01:06.95]Raging on in holy war
[02:17.32][01:09.30]Soon there'll come a day
[02:20.58][01:12.47]When you're face to face with me
[01:26.53][01:21.99][01:17.28]Face to face with me
[01:30.81]
[01:36.69]Can't you hear us coming?
[01:39.03]People marching all around
[01:41.03]Can't you see we're coming?
[01:43.23]Close your eyes it's over now
[01:45.55]Can't you hear us coming?
[01:47.77]The fight has only just begun
[01:50.12]Can't you see we're coming?
[01:54.70]
[02:22.01]A freedom fighter
[02:23.49]No remorse
[02:24.40]Raging on in holy war
[02:26.50]Soon there'll come a day
[02:29.67]When you're face to face to face to face
[02:32.06]To face to face wih me
