[00:15.71]There\'s no need to argue,
[00:18.35]you think you\'re always right.
[00:21.25]I won\'t even bother, it\'s just another fight.
[00:26.41]You always have it your way, but someday,
[00:29.06]you\'ll see it\'s not about how much you pay.
[00:31.80]Daddy\'s gonna buy you the world,
[00:35.21]\'cause that\'s what you want.
[00:36.33]
[00:37.45]But that won\'t make you happy, baby,
[00:39.58]it\'s only gonna drive you crazy.
[00:42.24]You\'ll keep on wanting more and more and more,
[00:44.77]you won\'t be satisfied.

[01:19.09]\'cause it always means no.
[01:21.79]But I\'m keeping my hopes up,
[01:24.20]that someday you\'ll grow up.
[01:27.33]You always have it your way, but someday,
[01:29.68]you\'ll see it\'s not about how much you pay.
