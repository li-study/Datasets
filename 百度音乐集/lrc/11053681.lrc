
[00:25.53]Morning sun, see the sky
[00:28.32]On the side of hill
[00:31.41]I can feel you like an angel
[00:36.75]
[00:37.56]You burn my heart and burn my soul
[00:40.73]I wish hold you in my arms
[00:44.05]You become my Rilakkuma
[00:49.49]
[01:42.86][00:49.96]Into my world, don't turn around
[01:45.84][00:53.09]I will give you all I want
[01:48.99][00:56.28]Don't be afraid, my Rilakkuma
[01:54.49][01:01.48]
[02:23.14][01:58.29][01:05.56]Pull the window, drop your shadow
[02:26.08][02:01.24][01:08.57]Feel the warm just from my heart
[02:29.29][02:04.43][01:11.75]Take a coffee, sit beside me
[02:32.36][02:07.54][01:14.82]I will tell you a tale
[02:35.52][02:10.56][01:17.88]
[02:35.70][02:10.76][01:18.06]Move your step a little closer
[02:38.41][02:13.57][01:20.90]Sing a song just in my ears
[02:41.69][02:16.90][01:24.11]I become your Rilakkuma
[02:44.81][02:20.00][01:27.19]I will take you to the end
[02:49.15][01:33.65]
