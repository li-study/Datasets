[00:11.50]Baby, I've been waiting,
[00:14.50]I've been waiting night and day.
[00:22.50]I didn't see the time,
[00:26.50]I waited half my life away.
[00:34.50]There were lots of invitations
[00:38.50]and I know you sent me some,
[00:45.50]but I was waiting
[00:48.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
[00:53.50]
[01:02.50]I know you really loved me.
[01:07.50]but, you see, my hands were tied.
[01:14.50]I know it must have hurt you,
[01:19.50]it must have hurt your pride
[01:26.50]to have to stand beneath my window
[01:30.50]with your bugle and your drum,
[01:36.50]and me I'm up there waiting
[01:41.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
[01:46.50]
[01:55.50]Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
[02:01.50]You wouldn't like it here.
[02:07.50]There ain't no entertainment
[02:11.50]and the judgements are severe.
[02:18.50]The Maestro says it's Mozart
[02:24.50]but it sounds like bubble gum
[02:30.50]when you're waiting
[02:34.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
[02:39.50]
[02:47.50]Waiting for the miracle
[02:54.50]There's nothing left to do.
[03:01.50]I haven't been this happy
[03:05.50]since the end of World War II.
[03:09.50]
[03:11.50]Nothing left to do
[03:13.50]when you know that you've been taken.
[03:16.50]Nothing left to do
[03:19.50]when you're begging for a crumb
[03:22.50]Nothing left to do
[03:25.50]when you've got to go on waiting
[03:29.50]waiting for the miracle to come.
[03:34.50]
[03:41.50]I dreamed about you, baby.
[03:45.50]It was just the other night.
[03:53.50]Most of you was naked
[03:56.50]Ah but some of you was light.
[04:04.50]The sands of time were falling
[04:08.50]from your fingers and your thumb,
[04:15.50]and you were waiting
[04:19.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come
[04:24.50]
[04:33.50]Ah baby, let's get married,
[04:38.50]we've been alone too long.
[04:45.50]Let's be alone together.
[04:49.50]Let's see if we're that strong.
[04:57.50]Yeah let's do something crazy,
[05:01.50]something absolutely wrong
[05:08.50]while we're waiting
[05:10.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
[05:16.50]
[05:25.50]Nothing left to do
[05:28.50]when you know that you've been taken.
[05:31.50]Nothing left to do
[05:34.50]when you're begging for a crumb
[05:37.50]Nothing left to do
[05:39.50]when you've got to go on waiting
[05:44.50]waiting for the miracle to come.
[05:48.50]
[05:56.50]When you've fallen on the highway
[06:00.50]and you're lying in the rain,
[06:07.50]and they ask you how you're doing
[06:11.50]of course you'll say you can't complain --
[06:19.50]If you're squeezed for information,
[06:23.50]that's when you've got to play it dumb:
[06:29.50]You just say you're out there waiting
[06:33.50]for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
[06:41.50]
