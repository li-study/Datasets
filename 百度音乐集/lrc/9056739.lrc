[00:02.00]Title: This I Promise To You
[00:03.00]
[00:04.00]Ooh, ooh
[00:07.00]
[00:12.00]Ooh, ooh
[00:18.00]
[00:25.00]When the visions around you
[00:30.00]Bring tears to your eyes
[00:36.00]And all that surrounds you
[00:42.00]Are secrets and lies
[00:46.00]I'll be your strength
[00:49.00]I'll give you hope
[00:52.00]Keeping your faith when it's gone
[00:58.00]The one you should call
[01:01.00]When standing here all alone
[01:07.00]
[01:10.00]And I will take you in my arms
[01:15.00]And hold you right where you belong
[01:22.00]Until the day my life is through
[01:26.00]This I promise you
[01:31.00]This I promise you
[01:36.00]
[01:37.00]I've loved you forever
[01:43.00]In lifetimes before
[01:48.00]And I promise you never
[01:54.00]Will you hurt anymore
[01:58.00]I give you my word
[02:01.00]I give you my heart
[02:05.00]This is a battle we've won
[02:10.00]And with this vow
[02:13.00]Forever has now begun
[02:18.00]
[02:19.00]Just close your eyes each loving day
[02:25.00]And know this feeling won't go away
[02:32.00]Till the day my life is through
[02:35.00]This I promise you
[02:41.00]This I promise you
[02:48.00]
[02:49.00]Over and over I thought
[02:54.00]When I hear you call
[02:59.00]Without you in my life baby
[03:05.00]I just wouldn't be living at all
[03:12.00]
[03:28.00]And I will take you in my arms
[03:34.00]And hold you right where you belong
[03:41.00]Until the day my life is through
[03:44.00]This I promise you
[03:48.00]
[03:49.00]Just close your eyes each loving day
[03:54.00]And know this feeling won't go away
[04:12.00][04:00.00]
[04:13.00][04:01.00]Every word I say is true
[04:17.00][04:05.00]This I promise you
[04:22.00]Ooh I promise you
[04:31.00]
