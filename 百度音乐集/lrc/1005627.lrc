[00:03.96]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[00:10.21]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[00:13.65]in a land called Honah Lee
[00:17.21]Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
[00:23.52]and brought him strings and sealing wax
[00:26.92]and other fancy stuff
[00:30.56]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[00:36.95]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[00:40.35]in a land called Honah Lee
[00:43.92]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[00:50.35]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[00:53.70]in a land called Honah Lee
[00:57.38]Together they would travel
[01:00.49]on a boat with billowed sail
[01:03.72]And Jackie kept a lookout perched
[01:07.20]On Puff's gigantic tail
[01:10.97]Noble kings and princes
[01:13.95]would bow whene'er they came
[01:17.33]And pirate ships would lower their flag
[01:22.52]when Puff roared out his name
[01:26.25]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[01:32.77]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[01:36.16]in a land called Honah Lee
[01:39.86]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[01:46.11]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[01:49.43]in a land called Honah Lee
[01:53.17]A dragon lives forever
[01:56.27]but not so little boys
[01:59.90]Painted wings and giant rings
[02:03.20]make way for other toys.
[02:06.78]One grey night it happened,
[02:09.78]Jackie Paper came no more
[02:13.19]And Puff that mighty dragon
[02:16.70]he ceased his fearless roar.
[02:20.13]His head was bent in sorrow
[02:23.71]green scales fell like rain
[02:27.29]Puff no longer went to play
[02:30.63]along the cherry lane
[02:33.80]Without his life-long friend
[02:37.50]Puff could not be brave
[02:40.57]So Puff that mighty dragon
[02:43.80]sadly slipped into his cave
[02:47.82]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[02:54.42]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[02:57.60]in a land called Honah Lee
[03:01.46]Puff,the magic dragon lived by the sea
[03:07.74]And frolicked in the autumn mist
[03:11.13]in a land called Honah Lee
