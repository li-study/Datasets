[00:12.80]
[00:14.13]Here we stand
[00:17.93]Somewhere in between this moment and the end
[00:23.50]
[00:27.47]Will we bend?
[00:31.42]Or will we open up and take this whole thing in?
[00:36.71]
[00:41.00]Everybody else is smiling and their smiles don't fade
[00:47.33]And you don't even wonder why you just don't think that way
[00:53.17]
[00:54.22]Maybe you and me got lost somewhere,
[00:57.67]We can't move or we can't stay here
[01:01.12]Well maybe we've just had enough,
[01:04.32]Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
[01:08.09]You and me tried everything
[01:11.22]But still that mocking bird won't sing
[01:14.62]Well man this life seems hard enough
[01:17.80]Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
[01:21.81]
[01:28.15]Take my hand
[01:32.55]And I will lead you through the broken promise land
[01:37.50]
[01:41.74]Yes I can, ah yes I can
[01:46.02]I can be there when you need it,
[01:49.67]I'll give it all till you can't feel it anymore
[01:53.95]
[01:55.60]I don't wanna love you now, if you'll just leave someday
[02:01.98]I don't wanna turn around, if you'll just walk away
[02:07.40]
[02:08.51]Maybe you and me got lost somewhere,
[02:12.14]We can't move or we can't stay here
[02:15.44]Well maybe we've just had enough,
[02:18.68]Well maybe we aint meant for this love
[02:22.54]You and me tried everything
[02:25.54]But still that mocking bird won't sing
[02:29.04]Well man this life seems hard enough
[02:32.13]Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
[02:36.09]
[02:55.86]Maybe you and me got lost somewhere,
[02:59.50]We can't move or we can't stay here
[03:02.83]Well maybe we've just had enough,
[03:06.01]Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
[03:09.94]You and me tried everything
[03:12.83]But still that mocking bird won't sing
[03:16.37]Well man this life seems hard enough
[03:19.48]Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
[03:23.37]
[03:33.45]Maybe we ain't meant for this love
[03:36.90]
[03:47.00]Maybe we ain't meant for this love
