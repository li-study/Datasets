[00:14.31]The current is strong from what I've heard
[00:19.93]It'll wisk you down the stream
[00:24.34]But there never seems to have time
[00:30.30]So my toes just touched the water
[00:33.82]My toes just touched the water
[00:36.50]
[00:40.61]Daydreamed on the bank again
[00:45.60]I was swimming with the fish
[00:50.33]And I thought this time that it may be true
[00:56.05]
[00:56.52]But my toes just touched the water
[00:59.80]My toes just touched the water
[01:02.69]My toes just touched the water
[01:05.64]
[01:08.51]Walked a mile just to find the edge
[01:13.13]Some place low enough to step right in
[01:20.66]Now I'm here and I can't begin to move
[01:30.15]
[02:17.86]Walked a mile just to find the edge
[02:21.94]Some place low enough to step right in
[02:29.38]Now I'm here and I can't begin to move
[02:38.02]
[02:48.28]The spoiled sun up over there
[02:53.38]It always has to have its way
[02:57.84]And I know that the river's there to shelter me
[03:03.82]
[03:25.26][03:19.42][03:04.22]My toes just touched the water
[03:22.18][03:16.29][03:13.32][03:10.23][03:07.43]My toes just touched the water
[03:27.48]
