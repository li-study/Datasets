[00:01.12]Barry Manilow - It Could Happen to You
[00:05.89]
[00:17.72]Hide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night
[00:25.51]It could happen to you
[00:33.17]Don't count stars or you might stumble
[00:40.98]Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble
[00:49.58]
[00:50.41]Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
[00:58.52]It could happen to you
[01:06.48]All I did was wonder how your arms would be
[01:14.85]And it happened to me
[01:21.06]
[01:42.87]Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
[01:50.89]It could happen to you
[01:57.31]All I did was wonder how your arms would be
[02:07.74]And it happened to me
[02:25.00]
