[01:01.78]Some folks like to get away
[01:04.60]Take a holiday from the neighborhood
[01:10.23]Hop a flight to Miami Beach
[01:12.89]Or to Hollywood
[01:18.36]But I'm taking a Greyhound
[01:21.57]On the Hudson River Line
[01:27.51]I'm in a New York state of mind
[01:33.99]
[01:39.44]I've seen all the movie stars
[01:42.22]In their fancy cars and their limousines
[01:47.01]Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
[01:55.65]But I know what I'm needing
[01:58.70]And I don't want to waste more time
[02:04.74]I'm in a New York state of mind
[02:09.82]
[02:16.61]It was so easy living day by day
[02:24.37]Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
[02:32.53]But now I need a little give and take
[02:39.52]The New York Times, The Daily News
[02:48.74]
[02:52.80]It comes down to reality
[02:55.87]And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
[03:00.72]Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
[03:08.95]I don't have any reasons
[03:12.92]I've left them all behind
[03:18.14]I'm in a New York state of mind
[03:24.67]
[04:06.44]It was so easy living day by day
[04:14.74]Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
[04:22.30]But now I need a little give and take
[04:29.55]The New York Times, The Daily News
[04:36.42]
[04:42.24]It comes down to reality
[04:45.31]And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
[04:50.29]Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
[04:58.09]I don't have any reasons
[05:01.92]I've left them all behind
[05:07.13]I'm in a New York state of mind
[05:12.88]
[05:18.40]I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River Line
[05:38.69]'Cause I'm in a New York state of mind
