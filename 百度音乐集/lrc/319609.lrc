[al:]

[00:22.81]For the first time I see it in your eyes
[00:28.46]For the first time it hurts deep inside
[00:34.32]I wish that I could turn back time
[00:39.25]But there′s no going back – no way to deny
[00:44.26]Ooohh suddenly
[00:47.78]It feels like loosing it all
[00:51.20]I′m trying so hard to be strong
[00:56.94]When I look in your eyes
[01:00.69]I don’t know how to tell you
[01:05.19]With every beat of my heart I try
[01:08.99]To find a way to survive
[01:11.90]Find a way to let go now
[01:16.45]Tell me how to live my life alone
[01:30.90]It′s so hard to tell the truth from the lies
[01:36.29]So would you hold my hand for one last goodbye
[01:41.14]I don’t know if I can let go
[01:47.16]Who will catch me if I stumble and fall
[01:55.72]suddenly
[01:59.36]It feels like loosing it all
[02:02.55]I′m trying so hard to be strong
[02:08.95]When I look in your eyes
[02:11.92]I don’t know how to tell you
[02:16.13]With every beat of my heart I try
[02:20.49]To find a way to survive
[02:23.35]Find a way to let go now
[02:27.85]Tell me how to live my life alone
[02:35.24]Ooohh tell me
[02:57.28]When I look in your eyes
[03:01.89]I don’t know how to tell you
[03:06.55]With every beat of my heart I try
[03:10.43]To find a way to survive
[03:13.20]Find a way to let go now
[03:18.10]Tell me how to live my life alone
