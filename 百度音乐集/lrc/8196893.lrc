[00:02.24]Singer:Jonhnny Cash
[00:03.71]
[00:07.83]At my door the leaves are falling
[00:12.20]A cold wild wind has come
[00:18.42]Sweethearts walk by together
[00:22.47]And I still miss someone
[00:28.47]I go out on a party
[00:33.47]And look for a little fun
[00:37.47]But I find a darkened corner
[00:43.47]because I still miss someone
[00:47.47]Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
[00:52.47]I see them every where
[00:58.47]I miss those arms that held me
[01:03.47]When all the love was there
[01:07.80]I wonder if she's sorry
[01:13.47]For leavin' what we'd begun
[01:17.80]There's someone for me somewhere
[01:23.47]And I still miss someone
