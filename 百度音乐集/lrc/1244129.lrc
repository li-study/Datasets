[00:15.84]Well I believe there's someone watching over you
[00:20.97]They're watching every single thing you say
[00:26.24]And when you die
[00:27.41]They'll set you down and take you through
[00:31.45]You'll realise one day
[00:33.93]
[00:36.82]That the grass is always greener on the other side
[00:39.70]The neighbour's got a new car that you wanna drive
[00:41.99]And when time is running out you wanna stay alive
[00:47.34]We all live under the same sky
[00:50.10]We all will live, we all will die
[00:52.64]There is no wrong, there is no right
[00:55.30]The circle only has one side
[01:00.05]
[01:08.33]We all try hard to live our lives in harmony
[01:13.54]For fear of falling swiftly overboard
[01:18.73]But life is both a major and minor key
[01:24.04]Just open up the chord
[01:27.06]
[02:43.10][02:22.08][01:29.25]But the grass is always greener on the other side
[02:45.68][02:24.71][01:32.17]The neighbour's got a new car that you wanna drive
[02:48.13][02:27.16][01:34.54]And when time is running out you wanna stay alive
[02:53.35][02:32.37][01:39.47]We all live under the same sky
[02:56.05][02:35.06][01:42.51]We all will live, we all will die
[02:58.64][02:37.62][01:45.08]There is no wrong, there is no right
[03:01.30][01:47.68]The circle only has one side
