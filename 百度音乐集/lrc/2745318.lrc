[00:00.00]Gary Moore - Empty Rooms
[00:15.25]Loneliness is your only friend
[00:20.38]A broken heart that just won't mend is the price you pay
[00:26.01]
[00:29.53]It's hard to take when love grows old
[00:35.08]The days are long and the nights turn cold when it fades away
[00:41.28]
[00:44.45]You hope that she will change her mind
[00:49.77]But the days drift on and on
[00:54.72]You'll never know the reason why she's gone
[00:59.52]
[01:01.91]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[01:11.36]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[01:20.47]
[01:28.41]You see her face in every crowd
[01:33.53]You hear her voice
[01:35.41]But you're still proud so you turn away
[01:39.35]
[01:43.06]You tell yourself that you'll be strong
[01:48.45]But your heart tells you this time you're wrong
[01:52.97]
[01:56.16]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[02:05.97]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[02:15.78]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love

[03:11.56]You hope that she will change her mind
[03:16.57]But the days drift on and on
[03:19.52](on and on)
[03:21.61]You'll never know the reason why she's gone
[03:29.19]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[03:38.95]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[03:48.76]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
[03:58.76]Empty rooms　where we learn to live without love
