[00:07.26]Can you patch my jeans Peggy Ann -
[00:13.53]Just a little stitch to mend the hole
[00:19.10]He has torn
[00:22.18]If you can
[00:24.21]
[00:26.21]Maybe I got too set in my ways
[00:32.56]He says she reminds him of me
[00:37.82]When we first met
[00:40.44]In those early days...
[00:43.63]
[02:53.59][02:16.97][00:46.17]The sexiest thing is trust
[02:56.72][02:20.08][00:49.38]I wake up to find
[02:59.04][02:22.41][00:51.67]The pirates have come
[03:06.31][02:29.71][00:58.90]Typing up along your coast
[03:09.37][02:32.78][01:02.05]How was I to know
[03:11.70][02:35.12][01:04.42]The pirates have come
[03:15.98][02:39.16][01:08.63]Between Rebecca's
[03:18.86][02:42.39][01:11.60]Beneath your firmaments
[03:22.25][02:45.49][01:14.72]I have worshipped
[03:30.33][01:22.80]In the Jamaica Inn
[03:36.35][01:28.81]In the Jamaica Inn
[03:41.18][01:33.34]
[01:37.88]With the gales
[01:39.15]My little boat was tossed
[01:44.29]How was I to know
[01:46.06]That you'd sent her
[01:49.53]With a lantern
[01:52.49]To bring me in
[01:55.05]
[01:57.12]"Are you positive this is a friend?"
[02:03.45]The captain grimaced,
[02:05.81]"Those are cliffs of rock ahead
[02:11.16]If I'm not mistaken."
