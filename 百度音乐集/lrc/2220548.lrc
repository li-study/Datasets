[00:00.68]Title: Face For The Radio
[00:06.98]You have a face for the radio,
[00:12.94]But I know you’d like to see it in a show,
[00:19.72]Claiming to be the next best everything,
[00:26.32]Which way will you go?
[00:30.18]
[00:32.27]You’re a little smarter than most of us,
[00:38.50]You run so fast sometimes it’s hard to see you for dust,
[00:44.66]Finding some time for you, it tortures me,
[00:51.33]Which way will you go?
[00:56.69]
[00:57.22]Wages on a Friday,
[00:58.90]Spent on a Saturday,
[01:00.28]Lend me a fiver,
[01:01.90]Won’t do that again,
[01:04.44]Oh your trust is not to strong.
[01:09.46]
[01:10.07]Your arrogance in a bag,
[01:11.72]Won’t spare you a fag,
[01:14.96]Superstar wannabe,
[01:16.03]Says it comes naturally,
[01:17.96]Cemented in your own feeble way,
[01:21.44]
[01:23.58]He watches trainspotting, fifteen times a week,
[01:29.90]Thinking it’s making him oh so unique,
[01:36.24]PC on summer nights and football in the rain,
[01:42.59]Doesn’t matter how far he is,
[01:45.12]He always has money for the train
[01:48.79]
[01:56.00]Nothing against you, love in my heart,
[02:02.16]You’re really a nice lad, I’ve known it from the start,
[02:08.46]Your conscience in eager, to know where you lie,
[02:15.11]Pushing your limits, give it up and remember you can cry.
[02:28.59]
[02:34.72]Wages on a Friday,
[02:36.47]Spent on a Saturday,
[02:37.83]Lend me a tenner,
[02:39.45]Won’t do that again,
[02:41.80]Oh your trust is not to strong.
[02:46.15]
[02:47.50]You’re arrogance in a bag,
[02:49.43]Won’t spare you a fag,
[02:50.87]Superstar wannabe,
[02:52.53]Says it comes naturally,
[02:54.94]in your own feeble way
