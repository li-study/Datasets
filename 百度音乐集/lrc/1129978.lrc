[00:00.00]Dixie chicks
[00:10.00]
[00:11.18]When the calls and conversations
[00:13.85]Accidents and accusations
[00:16.59]Messages and misperceptions
[00:19.33]Paralyze my mind
[00:22.27]Busses, cars, and airplanes leaving
[00:24.90]Burning fumes of gasoline
[00:27.33]And everyone is running
[00:29.74]And I come to find a refuge in the
[00:33.27]Easy silence that you make for me
[00:38.00]It\'s okay when there\'s nothing more to say to me
[00:43.57]And the peaceful quiet you create for me
[00:49.06]And the way you keep the world at bay for me
[00:54.93]The way you keep the world at bay
[01:11.97]Monkeys on the barricades
[01:14.32]Are warning us to back away
[01:17.27]They form commissions trying to find
[01:19.88]The next one they can crucify
[01:22.99]And anger plays on every station
[01:25.87]Answers only make more questions
[01:28.44]I need something to believe in
[01:31.34]Breathe in sanctuary in the
[01:34.03]Easy silence that you make for me
[01:38.73]It\'s okay when there\'s nothing more to say to me
[01:44.45]And the peaceful quiet you create for me
[01:49.74]And the way you keep the world at bay for me
[01:55.75]The way you keep the world at bay
[02:01.06]...Music...
[02:23.66]Children lose their youth too soon
[02:26.17]Watching war made us immune
[02:29.09]And I\'ve got all the world to lose
[02:31.81]But I just want to hold on to the
[02:34.89]Easy silence that you make for me
[02:39.57]It\'s okay when there\'s nothing more to say to me
[02:45.11]And the peaceful quiet you create for me
[02:50.57]And the way you keep the world at bay for me
[02:56.44]The easy silence that you make for me
[03:01.65]It\'s okay when there\'s nothing more to say to me
[03:07.28]And the peaceful quiet you create for me
[03:12.59]And the way you keep the world at bay for me
[03:18.50]The way you keep the world at bay for me
[03:24.02]The way you keep the world at bay
[03:32.17]...Music...
