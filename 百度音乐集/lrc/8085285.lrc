[00:25.96]
[01:02.00]A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder
[01:06.72]A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
[01:11.25]The chill up my spine, can't get any colder
[01:15.98]And you wonder why I can't smile
[01:19.67]
[01:20.81]A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
[01:25.33]In the heat of the moment, I'm knocked off the track
[01:30.00]You drop the ball, I pick up the slack
[01:34.55]And you ask me why my hairs gray
[01:37.66]
[01:39.55]Twisting, turning
[01:44.57]Losing all sense of yearning
[01:48.81]Living and learning
[01:53.22]The pressure keeps on burning my soul
[01:59.31]
[02:00.57]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[02:05.18]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[02:09.90]
[02:17.10]I say it's green and then you tell me it's red
[02:21.24]Keep your thoughts and ideas
[02:23.40]Locked inside of your head
[02:26.23]We've got someone
[02:27.83]Who can think for you instead
[02:30.63]And he sounds just like the last one
[02:33.63]
[02:35.57]Twisting, turning
[02:40.69]Losing all sense of yearning
[02:44.91]Living and learning
[02:49.34]The pressure keeps on burning my soul
[02:54.85]
[02:56.61]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[03:01.20]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[03:06.12]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[03:10.57]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[03:14.21]
[03:57.42]Responsible thinkers
[03:59.87]Throw caution to the wind
[04:01.55]But I find myself
[04:03.18]Speaking from within
[04:05.61]I can't live my life
[04:07.44]Walking on eggshells
[04:09.81]To stay on your good side
[04:11.81]
[04:13.97]Using your words
[04:15.80]Controlling my life
[04:17.46]Can't you see it's my words
[04:19.78]That gives you your life
[04:21.84]So I hurt your feelings
[04:23.80]Well I'm really sorry
[04:25.48]But I don't give a shit...
[04:27.73]
[04:30.28]Twisting, turning
[04:35.32]Losing all sense of yearning
[04:39.61]Living and learning
[04:44.00]The pressure keeps on burning my soul
[04:50.59]
[04:51.20]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[04:55.90]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
[05:00.61]Burning my soul (Burning my soul)
