[00:01.06]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[00:08.19]In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
[00:14.28]I was born too late to a world that doesn’t care
[00:20.81]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[00:30.15]When the head of state didn’t play guitar,
[00:30.88]Not everybody drove a car,
[00:32.24]When music really mattered and radio was king,
[00:36.98]When accountants didn’t have control
[00:39.27]And the media couldn’t buy your soul
[00:41.36]And computers were still scary and we didn’t know everything
[00:46.04]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[00:50.94]In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
[00:55.25]I was born too late to a world that doesn’t care
[00:57.98]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[01:05.19]When popstars still remained a myth
[01:07.48]And ignorance could still be bliss
[01:10.75]And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
[01:14.23]When my mom and dad were in their teen
[01:16.47]and anarchy was still a dream
[01:18.84]and the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail
[01:22.57]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[01:27.33]In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
[01:31.61]I was born too late to a world that doesn’t care
[01:35.71]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[01:42.19]When record shops was still top
[01:44.15]and vinyl was all that they stocked
[01:46.31]and the super info highway was still drifting out in space
[01:51.72]kids were wearing hand me downs,
[01:54.45]and playing games meant kick arounds
[01:56.20]and footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face
[02:00.77]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[02:03.74]In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
[02:06.95]I was born too late to a world that doesn’t care
[02:11.87]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
[02:17.84]I was born too late to a world that doesn’t care
[02:25.22]Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
