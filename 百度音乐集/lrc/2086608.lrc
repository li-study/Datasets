[00:05.22]演唱：彭靖惠
[00:11.00]
[01:03.96]I thought it's gonna be　so much easier
[01:11.95]As time goes by
[01:16.06]as time goes by
[01:20.64]But I still　I still　can't break through
[01:28.77]The wall that we built
[01:32.37]To make sure　what we believe is always true
[01:38.94]
[01:45.21]Oh　how is it gonna be
[01:53.24]Oh　oh
[02:01.07]I wonder how　you must have felt
[02:04.92]On the other side　of the wall
[02:11.60]
[02:36.74]The Christmas carals　on the radio
[02:44.38]About faith and love
[02:47.96]All those fantastic morals
[02:52.64]Aren't we supposed　to love one another
[03:00.99]To accept the differences
[03:05.38]And learn　to let the hatred go
[03:12.14]
[03:17.78]Oh　how is it gonna be
[03:25.82]Oh　oh
[03:33.45]Will there be a day
[03:37.52]We want to break down　the wall
[03:46.49]
