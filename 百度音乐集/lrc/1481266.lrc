[00:37.08]I can sleep what side I want
[00:42.81]It's not the same with you gone

[01:30.42]It's been three years One night apart
[01:35.86]but in that night you tore my heart
[01:43.01]If only you had slept alone
[01:47.75]If those seeds had not been sown
[01:55.87]Oh you could come home and you would know that
