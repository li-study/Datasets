[00:03.26]I would have it start this way

[00:26.47]Now the game is cool to see, you can high five up to me
[00:29.50]Count the riot on the one, two, three
[00:31.74]Operation is inside and the field is open wide
[00:34.86]When you break everything you know you're still alive
[00:37.10]And The cops will you make you pay and you think you get away
[00:40.08]Then you know that it's a One Fine Day (Hey)
[00:53.04]And before the day was through

[01:51.51]I believe it's my God-given right
[01:54.85]To destroy everything in my sight
