[00:14.50]Escape
[00:19.26]Another day goes without any change
[00:23.25]The feeling we live with still remains
[00:27.21]We're stuck in a whole and we're searching for anything to hold on to
[00:34.90]There has to be somewhere that we can be safe from the lives we live each day
[00:42.33]There has to be somewhere that we can be far away.....
[00:50.02]We have to escape and I will go anywhere if you just lead the way
[00:57.27]Escape to a place where we'll be together, together everyday
[01:10.29]We could be living how we wanted to
[01:14.73]Instead of doing things we're forced to do
[01:18.19]With no one to tell us that we should be going through what they went through
[01:25.90]There has to be someplace that nobody knows, somewhere we can only go
[01:33.49]There has to be some place that we can be all alone.......
