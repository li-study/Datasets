[00:10.60]Every time our eyes meet
[00:12.64]This feeling inside me
[00:17.26]Is almost more than I can take
[00:23.91]Baby when you touch me
[00:27.23]I can feel how much you love me
[00:30.87]And it just blows me away
[00:37.52]I've never been this close to anyone or anything
[00:44.46]I can hear your thoughts
[00:47.92]I can see your dreams
[00:51.44]I don't know how you do what you do
[03:05.90][02:18.14][00:55.90]I'm so in love with you
[03:09.43][02:21.43][00:59.18]It just keeps getting better
[03:15.68][02:27.68][01:05.34]I want to spend the rest of my life
[03:19.28][02:31.70][01:09.48]With you by my side
[03:23.04][02:35.19][01:12.99]Forever and ever
[03:36.13][03:29.24][03:02.40][02:41.29][02:12.94][01:19.18]Every little thing that you do
[03:39.66][02:45.10][01:22.81]Baby, I'm amazed by you
[01:25.81]雷健昌,  我愛你喔..
[01:32.47]The smell of your skin
[01:37.25]The taste of your kiss
[01:39.44]The way you whisper in the dark
[01:46.19]Your hair all around me
[01:49.43]Baby you surround me
[01:52.89]You touch every place in my heart
[02:00.05]Oh, it feels like the first time, every time
[02:06.83]I want to spend the whole night in your eyes
[02:50.86]沒有你..不懂怎樣過呢,小豬..請不要離開
