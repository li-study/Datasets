[00:24.25]It's either black or white, that's right
[00:28.50]We're makin love or in a fight
[00:31.75]Sometimes you make me so blue
[00:36.00]But then it feels so good, I knew it would
[00:39.85]You do the things to make me crazy
[00:42.50]I want to give it to you

[01:13.75]You take me high and low, you know
[01:17.00]I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
[01:20.25]You're such a mystery to me
[01:24.50]But baby hot or cold, you got a hold
[01:28.75]Of my imagination

[02:02.50]Suddenly the sun comes out
[02:08.55]Sometimes north or south of love
