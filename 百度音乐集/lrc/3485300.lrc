[00:00.39]Waters Of March Song Lyrics
[00:02.00]by Anya Marina
[00:03.84]
[00:08.24]&Eacute; pau, é pedra,
[00:09.84]é o fim do caminho
[00:12.35]&Eacute; um resto de toco,
[00:14.08]é um pouco sozinho
[00:16.36]
[00:19.10]A stick, a stone,
[00:21.18]It's the end of the road,
[00:23.24]It's feeling alone
[00:24.95]It's the weight of your load
[00:26.50]
[00:27.12]It's a sliver of glass
[00:28.71]It's light, it's the sun
[00:30.54]It's night, it's death
[00:32.34]It's a knife, it's a gun
[00:33.97]
[00:34.54]A flower that blooms
[00:36.10]A fox in the brush
[00:37.84]A knot in the wood
[00:39.65]The song of a thrush
[00:40.92]
[00:41.78]The mystery of life
[00:43.44]The steps down the hall
[00:45.35]The sound of the wind
[00:46.79]And the waterfall
[00:48.76]
[00:49.13]It's the moon floating free
[00:50.67]The curve of the slope
[00:52.22]It's an ant, it's a bee
[00:54.23]It's a reason for hope
[00:55.72]
[00:56.08]And the riverbank sings
[00:58.19]Of the waters of March
[00:59.62]It's the promise of Spring
[01:01.61]It's the joy in your heart
[01:03.28]
[01:10.89]&Eacute; o pé, é o ch&atilde;o,
[01:12.58]é a marcha estradeira
[01:14.33]Passarinho na m&atilde;o,
[01:16.20]pedra de atiradeira
[01:18.08]
[01:18.33]&Eacute; uma ave no céu,
[01:19.88]é uma ave no ch&atilde;o
[01:21.70]&Eacute; um regato, é uma fonte,
[01:23.79]é um peda&ccedil;o de p&atilde;o
[01:25.42]
[01:25.65]&Eacute; o fundo do po&ccedil;o,
[01:27.07]é o fim do caminho
[01:28.99]No rosto o desgosto,
[01:31.11]é um pouco sozinho
[01:32.64]
[01:32.96]A spear, a spike,
[01:34.47]A stake, a nail
[01:36.22]It's a drip, it's a drop
[01:38.66]It's the end of the tale
[01:39.70]
[01:40.22]The dew on a leaf
[01:41.76]In the morning light
[01:43.74]The shot of a gun
[01:45.72]In the dead of night
[01:46.82]
[01:47.53]A mile, a must
[01:49.08]A thrust, a bump
[01:50.84]It's the will to survive
[01:52.62]It's a jolt, it's a jump
[01:54.20]
[01:54.70]The prim of a house
[01:56.32]A body in bed
[01:58.61]A car stuck in the mud
[02:00.17]It's the mud, it's the mud
[02:01.56]
[02:02.17]A fish, a flash
[02:03.67]A wish, a wing
[02:05.53]It's a hawk, it's a dove
[02:07.30]It's the promise of Spring
[02:08.86]
[02:09.43]And the riverbank sings
[02:11.20]Of the waters of March
[02:12.88]It's the end of despair
[02:14.87]It's the joy in your heart
[02:16.27]
[02:46.37]&Eacute; uma cobra, é um pau,
[02:47.80]é Jo&atilde;o, é José
[02:49.37]&Eacute; um espinho na m&atilde;o,
[02:51.37]é um corte no pé
[02:53.19]
[02:53.47]S&atilde;o as águas de mar&ccedil;o
[02:55.04]fechando o ver&atilde;o
[02:57.16]&Eacute; a promessa de vida
[02:58.71]no teu cora&ccedil;&atilde;o
[03:00.20]
[03:00.94]A stick, a stone
[03:02.39]It's the end of the road
[03:04.31]The stump of a tree
[03:05.95]It's a frog, it's a toad
[03:07.56]
[03:08.10]A sigh, a breath
[03:09.97]A walkaround
[03:11.86]A life or death
[03:13.66]A ray in the sun
[03:14.87]
[03:15.49]And the riverbank sings
[03:17.27]Of the waters of March
[03:18.90]It's the promise of life
[03:20.67]It's the joy in your heart
[03:22.22]
