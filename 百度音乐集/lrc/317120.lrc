[00:25.21]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:38.15]Just like the ones I used to know.
[00:47.76]Where the treetops glisten,
[00:54.67]And children listen
[01:00.47]To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
[01:09.94]
[01:13.45]I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[01:26.32]With every Christmas card I write.
[01:35.79]May your days be merry and bright.
[01:48.16]And may all your Christmases be white.
[01:59.36]
[02:21.50]May you days be merry and bright
[02:36.36]And may all your Christmases
[02:42.76]may all your Christmases
[02:49.09]And may all your Christmases be white
[03:00.58]
