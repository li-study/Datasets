[00:09.70]Lost in the crowd where forever i'll never be seen.
[00:20.84]Shouting out loud, gotta find a way out of this dream, mhmmmm.
[00:23.64]Cause I don't want to hide, not from the world outside.
[00:31.38]Today my eyes are open wide.
[00:37.74]Chorus:
[00:38.14]And now I'm awake.
[00:43.83]I have no fear, won't disappear, I'll still be here tomorrow.
[00:52.50]And now I'm awake.
[00:58.81]I'm feeling strong I'll carry on, a thousand years and more.
[01:14.92]Maybe I'm shy, but inside i just wanna be free.
[01:20.37]Maybe I found there's a quiet in people like me, mhmmmm.
[01:28.11]But there's a noise within, that's where our voice begins.
[01:36.08]And then the sound of silence ends.
[01:42.33]And now I'm awake.
[01:48.65]I have no fear, won't disappear, I'll still be here tomorrow.
[01:57.37]And now I'm awake.
[02:03.92]I'm feeling strong I'll carry on, a thousand years and more.
[02:12.52]So every step I take's an act of faith.
[02:20.56]Everywhere I go I find myself.
[02:29.98]Now I'm awake, mmmmm.
[02:36.47]I have no fear, won't disappear, I'll still be hear tomorrow.
[02:45.38]Now I'm awake.
[02:52.60]I'm feeling strong, I'll carry on, a thousand years and more.
[03:01.04]Now I'm awake!
[03:09.88]Ooooohooooo.
[03:12.49]Now I'm awake
[03:23.05]Now I'm awake
[03:31.28]Now I'm awake
[03:39.04]Now I'm awake
[03:41.08]
