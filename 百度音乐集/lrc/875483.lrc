[00:08]It doesn't mean much
[00:12]It doesn't mean anything at all
[00:18]The life I've left behind me
[00:21]Is a cold room
[00:24]I've crossed the last line
[00:29]From where I can't return
[00:34]Where every step I took in faith betrayed me
[00:42]And led me from my home
[00:51]And sweet surrender
[01:00]Is all I have to give
[01:07]You take me in
[01:12]No questions asked
[01:17]You strip away the ugliness
[01:20]That surrounds me
[01:24]Are you an angel?
[01:29]Am I already that gone?
[01:34]I only hope that I won't disappoint you
[01:41]When I'm down here on my knees
[01:50]Sweet surrender
[01:59]Is all I have to give
[02:07]Sweet surrender
[02:17]Is all I have to give
[02:25]And I don't understand
[02:29]How the touch of your hand
[02:34]I would be the first to fall
[02:41]I miss the little things
[02:48]Oh, I miss everything
[02:57]It doesn't mean much
[03:02]It doesn't mean anything at all
[03:07]The life I left behind me
[03:11]Is a cold room
[03:16]Sweet surrender
[03:24]Is all I have to give
[03:33]Sweet surrender
[03:41]Is all I have to give
