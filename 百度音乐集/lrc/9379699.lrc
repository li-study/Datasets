[00:14.20]A few stolen moments is all that we share
[00:21.56]You've got your family  and they need you there
[00:28.95]Though I've tried to resist  being last on your list
[00:36.23]But no other man's gonna do
[00:43.33]So I'm saving all my love for you
[00:53.82]It's not very easy  living all alone
[01:01.33]My friends try and tell me  find a man of my own
[01:08.67]But each time I try  I just break down and cry
[01:15.74]Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
[01:23.40]So I'm saving all my love for you
[01:31.52]You used to tell me we'd run away together
[01:37.92]Love gives you the right to be free
[01:44.94]You said be patient  just wait a little longer
[01:52.55]But that's just an old fantasy
[02:00.00]I've got to get ready  just a few minutes more
[02:06.91]Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
[02:14.03]For tonight is the night  for feeling alright
[02:21.24]We'll be making love the whole night through
[02:28.35]So I'm saving all my love
[02:31.90]Yes I'm saving all my love
[02:35.63]Yes I'm saving all my love for you
[02:46.78]No other woman  is gonna love you more
[02:53.80]Cause tonight is the night  that I'm feeling alright
[03:00.90]We'll be making love the whole night through
[03:08.37]So I'm saving all my love
[03:12.03]Yeah I'm saving all my love
[03:15.80]Yes I'm saving all my love for you
[03:26.45]For you  for you
[03:39.95]
