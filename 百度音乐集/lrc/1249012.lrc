[00:03.00]
[00:09.74]Potential, well, you're a loaded line
[00:15.06]The veil between the world and the faceless bride
[00:19.81]There's nothing yet but a bunch of white
[00:24.38]Oh potential, well, you're a loded line
[00:28.15]
[00:31.54]Tomorrow, well, I will wait for you
[00:35.70]Laying right here floating in this swimming pool
[00:40.63]There's a lot of things I've got left to do
[00:45.02]Oh tomorrow, but I'll wait for you
[00:49.31]
[00:50.24]The days keep slipping down into the cracks
[00:59.18]It takes a while to realise where you're at
[01:08.56]Slowly (so slowly)
[01:11.75]Slowly (so slowly)
[01:13.79]Slowly, it's slowly ending
[01:19.46]
[01:28.31]Dementia, you better treat me good
[01:33.40]The human race is in its second childhood
[01:37.97]I never loved but I understood
[01:42.55]Oh dementia, you better treat me good
[01:46.63]
[01:49.59]Sometimes I need a place to go
[01:54.30]Classical music plays from the radio
[01:58.77]I sit real still, let my shadow grow
[02:03.54]Yeah, sometimes I need a place to go
[02:07.57]
[02:08.49]My mind keeps slipping back into the past
[02:16.67]I hope someday I can get it back
[02:26.57]Slowly (so slowly)
[02:29.89]Slowly (so slowly)
[02:32.04]Slowly, they're slowly ending
[02:35.78]So slowly
[02:37.01]Slowly (so slowly)
[02:39.23]Slowly, slowly
[02:43.22]It's slowly ending
[02:45.64]
[02:46.45]And soon that train is going to pull away
[02:51.60]I hear it whistling, I try to wave at a glowing face
[03:00.87]They can't tell who I am
[03:05.51]Slowly (so slowly)
[03:08.53]Slowly (so slowly)
[03:10.71]Slowly, it's slowly ending
[03:16.81]
