[00:19.97]Dress me up a thousand ways
[00:21.99]You're counting down the days
[00:23.22]Till I fall from my pedestal
[00:25.05]And then you can rescue me
[00:27.00]All the world can see
[00:28.36]You're the centre of it all
[00:30.36]We gave it our best try
[00:31.90]But then it was goodbye
[00:32.91]We were better off alone
[00:35.47]But now that's all gone for you
[00:36.91]And life is wrong for you
[00:38.19]But I can't help that
[01:19.27][00:39.33]
[02:38.56][02:18.70][01:39.25][01:19.42][00:40.04]You don't need love
[02:41.76][02:22.08][01:43.09][01:22.69][00:43.12]It's a question of obsession
[02:44.27][02:24.72][01:45.19][01:25.18][00:45.50]So drawn to your own reflection
[02:48.48][02:28.74][01:49.21][01:29.37][00:49.74]You want someone
[02:51.86][02:32.18][01:52.47][01:32.62][00:52.95]Like a personal possession
[02:54.50][02:34.61][01:55.11][01:35.23][00:55.63]To shine light on your perfection
[01:58.92]
[00:59.75]Call me up a thousand times
[01:01.59]You're hanging on the line
[01:02.93]Waiting for me to react
[01:04.90]But we've been here before
[01:06.84]And when I closed the door
[01:07.92]I never wanted a second act
[01:09.76]I saw it all clearly
[01:11.24]But you didn't hear me
[01:12.71]Thought our love was centre stage
[01:14.84]But now that's all gone for us
[01:16.59]And you are dangerous
[01:17.77]And I can't help that
[01:58.94]Gave my heart a thousand times
[02:01.04]And I can't count the nights
[02:02.62]That I cried myself to sleep
[02:04.14]But now I'm so over you
[02:05.88]And I see what you do
[02:07.18]Your sincerity's kinda cheap
[02:09.29]Remember the mind games
[02:10.72]Driving me insane
[02:11.88]When my life was not my own
[02:14.03]And even though you have gone
[02:15.98]It still carries on
[02:17.13]And I can't stop it.
[02:58.43](Obsession is dangerous stay on mind...)
