[00:07.68]夏菁 我一年都很怀念
[00:10.48]那短暂的永恒
[00:11.35]早冬的清晨你是否会一样
[00:18.83]You, you know how to get me solo
[00:25.23]My heart had a crash when we spoke
[00:28.80]I can't fix what you broke
[00:35.73]And you, you always have a reason
[00:42.29]Again and again this feelin
[00:46.55]Why do I give in
[00:52.85]And I always was, always was one for cryin
[01:03.87]I always was one for tears
[01:10.13]The sun's getting cold, it's snowin
[01:14.26]Looks like an early winter for us
[01:23.47]Looks like an early winter for us
[01:31.16]An early winter, oh why did you deter me over
[01:46.43]You said the map of the world is on you
[01:52.68]The moon gravitates around you
[01:57.13]The seasons escape you
[02:03.16]And I always was, always was one for cryin
[02:13.71]I always was one for tears
[02:20.40]No I never was, never was one for lyin
[02:30.87]You lied to me all these years
[02:37.49]The sun's getting cold, it's snowin
[02:42.21]Looks like an early winter for us
[02:50.77]Looks like an early winter for us
[03:01.60]An early winter, oh why did you deter me over
[03:16.62]Why, why do you act so stupid
[03:25.14]Why, you know I'm always right
[03:34.07]Looks like an early winter for us
[03:41.60]It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
[03:50.48]An early winter for us
[03:59.33]The leaves are changing colors
[04:09.63]Starting over and over and over again
[04:09.84]Starting over and over and over again
[04:18.21]Starting over and over and over again
[04:24.71]Well it looks like an early winter for us
[04:34.07]It looks like an early winter for us
