[00:01.13]Innocence Faded
[00:04.57]Dream Theater
[00:06.84]Awake
[00:08.66]
[00:10.89]Music: Dream Theater
[00:13.49]
[00:31.51]Animation
[00:35.90]Breathes a cloudless mind
[00:40.30]Fascination
[00:44.64]Leaves the doubting blind
[00:48.47]Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
[00:57.63]The faithful live Awake
[01:01.65]The rest remain misled
[01:05.68]
[01:06.63]Some will transcend spinning years
[01:15.40]One as if time disappears
[01:20.27]
[01:38.63]Innocence faded
[01:42.35]The mirror falls behind you
[01:47.20]Trinity jaded
[01:50.91]I break down walls to find you
[01:54.71]
[01:55.73]Callow and vain
[01:59.44]Fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
[02:04.27]Passionless stage
[02:07.94]Distant like brothers
[02:11.04]Wearing apathetic displays
[02:15.33]Sharing flesh like envy in cages
[02:20.21]Condescending
[02:22.31]Not intending to end
[02:28.50]
[02:29.74]Some will transcend spinning years
[02:38.25]One as if time disappears
[02:43.55]
[02:53.70]Innocence faded
[02:57.38]The mirror falls behind you
[03:02.22]Trinity jaded
[03:05.90]I break down walls to find you
[03:09.71]
[03:10.66]Beginnings get complicated
[03:13.46]The farther we progress
[03:18.72]Opinions are calculated
[03:21.61]Immune to openness
[03:25.88]
[03:26.68]Beyond the circle's edge
[03:29.70]We're driven by her blessings
[03:34.68]Forever hesitating
[03:38.12]Caught beneath the wheel
[03:42.27]
[03:43.31]Innocence faded
[03:46.94]The mirror falls behind you
[03:51.77]Cynically jaded
[03:55.48]The child will crawl to find you
[04:07.69]
