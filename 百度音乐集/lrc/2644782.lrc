[00:00.00]Vertical Horizon-Echo
[00:00.93]Joe的珍藏单曲
[00:01.59]Echo, echo...
[00:06.23]We come, we go-woah
[00:10.74]No I don't want to be just another
[00:16.81]Echo, echo...
[00:21.58]
[00:31.51]Everywhere I go
[00:34.06]There's something I really need
[00:36.80]Everyone I know
[00:39.36]Is someone I want to be
[00:42.49]Even though
[00:44.63]I don't really know me
[00:52.54]I better pick it up
[00:55.16]Before I let it slip away
[00:58.03]I better stick it out
[01:00.39]Before I take another day
[01:02.93]Into mouth
[01:05.80]Everything I say fades out
[01:15.22]Echo, echo...
[01:20.14]We come, we go-woah
[01:24.69]No I don't want to be just another
[01:30.64]Echo, echo...
[01:37.94]
[01:39.87]Can I open up your eyes?
[01:42.71]Only when the clouds break?
[01:45.34]Can I feel the light?
[01:47.98]Even though the world shakes
[01:50.46]Every night,
[01:53.41]You're my quiet satellite
[02:00.97]Can I hold you close?
[02:03.84]Do her out of focus
[02:06.48]And everything I know
[02:09.16]I don't even know this
[02:12.01]It all falls through
[02:15.24]I'm here and I hear you
[02:23.47]Echo, echo...
[02:28.74]We come, we go-woah
[02:33.27]No I don't want to be just another
[02:39.25]Echo, echo...
[02:44.56]Do you hear me?
[02:47.18]Do you hear me?
[02:49.67]Cause I need to, just to reach you
[02:55.16]Can you hear me?
[02:57.77]Coming clearly?
[03:01.14]Am I hollow?
[03:02.89]Just an echo
[03:05.95]Echo, echo...
[03:11.05]We come, we go-woah
[03:15.65]No I don't want to be just another
[03:21.68]Echo, echo...
[03:27.23]Echo, echo...
[03:32.47]We come, we go-woah
[03:36.78]No I don't want to be just another
[03:43.14]Echo, echo...
[03:52.04]Just a another day
[03:54.80]Every single word I say fades out
