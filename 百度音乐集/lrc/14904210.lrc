[00:00.00]Our Lady Peace - Sorry
[00:00.49]
[00:00.99]Today's a reason for living
[00:03.79]Today's the blood from a stone
[00:06.63]Today's a light from a candle
[00:09.37]Helping us to find our way home
[00:12.22]
[00:12.60]Today we carry each other
[00:15.44]Today the past is a freak
[00:18.18]Today's a time for forgiveness
[00:21.13]You were never that good to me
[01:23.47][00:23.71](Welcome to this world of mine)
[01:26.76][00:26.93]I'm sorry, I can't lie
[01:30.37][00:30.77]I'm wasting too much time
[01:32.55][00:32.96]Drowning I've been blind
[01:35.80][00:36.19]But I've opened up my eyes
[01:38.09][00:38.60]Sorry, I can't lie
[01:41.49][00:42.00]So I just say goodbye
[01:44.05][00:44.51]Goodbye
[01:45.47][00:45.88]Goodbye
[01:48.27][00:49.00]Yeah
[00:50.03]
[01:00.93]Today's tasting the honey
[01:03.77]Today's the strike of a match
[01:06.67]And today's the lines in the pavement
[01:09.35]Helping us to find our way back
[01:12.25]Today's the crosses we carry
[01:15.11]Today's the strength that we need
[01:17.95]And today's the hand of an angel
[01:20.68]You were not the kind to believe
[01:49.36]
[02:05.61][02:02.87][02:00.19]Oh what a day, oh what a day, oh my God
[02:08.41]And oh my God, and oh my God, yeah
[02:11.41]Today we carry each other
[02:14.21]Today we do what we should
[02:16.84]Today's a time for forgiving
[02:19.13]Today I wish I could...
[02:22.52]I'm sorry, I can't lie
[02:26.14]I'm wasting too much time
[02:28.21]Drowning, I've been blind
[02:31.51]But I've opened up my eyes
[02:33.82]Sorry, I can't lie
[02:37.20]So I just say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[02:43.60]Another bye, goodbye, goodbye
[02:48.96]Another bye, goodbye, goodbye, yeah
[02:54.54]Another bye, goodbye, goodbye
