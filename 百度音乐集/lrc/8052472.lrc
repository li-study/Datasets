[00:47.55]The red light of the sun, slowly descending
[00:58.94]The sky is all I see, it\'s never ending
[01:08.06]We could fly, you and I
[01:19.90]On a cloud
[01:26.33]kissing, kissing
[01:45.08]The wind plays with the leaves
[01:50.84]the weather turns colder
[01:56.07]But as long as we believe
[02:01.72]love doesn\'t get older
[02:06.00]We could fly,you and I
[02:16.75]On a cloud
[02:23.52]kissing, kissing
[03:04.98]On a journey of the heart
[03:10.28]there\'s so much to see
[03:16.55]And when the sky is dark
[03:22.12]you\'ll be right here
[03:25.88]right here with me
[03:36.71]Right here with me
