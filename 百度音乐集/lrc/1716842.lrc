[00:24.80]Can't you see that I'm sick of this?
[00:30.75]Chances are you're oblivious
[00:37.69]To how I feel, Sitting on your throne
[00:44.68]And I'm sure that I'm not alone,
[00:51.84]not alone, not alone
[00:58.04]Tell me please, who the fuck did you want me to be?
[01:04.46]Was it something that I couldn't see?
[01:07.94]Never knew this would be so political
[01:13.04]And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
[01:18.47]And it's starting to tear from within
[01:21.90]But it's obvious that doesn't bother you
[01:26.80]So please
[01:31.46]I didn't think that you'd sell me out
[01:37.55]Now I know what you're all about
[01:44.44]You might feel in control of things
[01:51.60]But you're not holding all the strings,
[01:58.58]all the strings, all the strings...
[02:04.84]Tell me please, who the fuck did you want me to be?
[02:11.12]Was it something that I couldn't see?
[02:14.56]Never knew this would be so political
[02:19.58]And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
[02:25.21]And it's starting to tear from within
[02:28.65]But it's obvious that doesn't matter to you
[02:35.42]I swallowed all your answers;
[02:42.40]I've swallowed all my pride
[02:49.36]You've used up all your chances,
[02:55.34]To keep this all inside
[03:01.13]Tell me please, who the fuck did you want me to be?
[03:07.29]Was it something that I couldn't see?
[03:10.95]Never knew this would be so political
[03:15.87]And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
[03:21.33]And it's starting to tear from within
[03:24.84]But it's obvious that doesn't bother you
[03:29.79]So please, don't keep telling me that it's okay
[03:35.39]I don't buy all the shit that you say
[03:38.88]And quite honestly I'm fucking sick of it
[03:43.81]So please, if I cut off this nose from my face
[03:49.46]Then I wouldn't feel so out of place
[03:52.98]But it still wouldn't be quite enough for you,
[03:57.91]So please
[04:00.53]
