[00:03.00]Some things in life are bad,
[00:06.00]They can really make you mad,
[00:09.00]Other things just make you swear and curse.
[00:13.00]When you're chewing on life's gristle
[00:15.00]Don't grumble, give a whistle.
[00:19.00]And this'll help things turn out for the best.
[00:23.00]And....
[00:25.00]Always look on the bright side of life, (whistle)
[00:33.00]Always look on the bright side of life, (whistle)
[00:41.00]If life seems jolly rotten,
[00:43.00]There's something you've forgotten,
[00:45.00]And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
[00:49.00]When you're feeling in the dumps,
[00:51.00]Don't be silly chumps.
[00:53.00]Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing.
[00:57.00]And...
[00:58.00]Always look on the bright side of life. (whistle)
[01:03.00]Come on...
[01:06.00]Always look on the bright side of life...
[01:13.00]For life is quite absurd,
[01:16.00]And death's the final word,
[01:17.00]You must always face the curtain with a bow.
[01:21.00]Forget about your sin,
[01:23.00]Give the audience a grin,
[01:25.00]Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.
[01:29.00]So always look on the bright side of death,
[01:37.00]Just before you draw your terminal breath,
[01:46.00]Life's a piece of shit,
[01:47.00]When you look at it,
[01:49.00]Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true.
[01:53.00]You'll see it's all a show,
[01:55.00]Keep 'em laughing as you go.
[01:57.00]Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
[02:01.00]And always look on the bright side of life,
[02:10.00]Always look on the right side of life,
[02:15.00]Come on guys, cheer up.
[02:17.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[02:26.00]
[02:31.00]Worse things happen at sea, you know.
[02:33.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[02:37.00]I mean - what have you got to lose?
[02:38.00]You know, you come from nothing,
[02:39.00]you're going back to nothing.
[02:41.00]What have you lost? Nothing!
[02:42.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[02:49.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[02:57.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[03:05.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[03:13.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
[03:21.00]Always look on the bright side of life.
