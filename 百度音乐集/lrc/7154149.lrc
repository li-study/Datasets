[03:16.58][00:17.02]
[00:30.70]Hey　一个女孩　为了恋爱　一生的命运从此改
[00:38.61]这是意外　不算意外　没有应该不应该
[00:44.95]
[01:29.79][00:45.23]世上　每天有不同的可惜
[01:32.88][00:48.66]她总选择微笑多於哭泣
[01:36.49][00:52.25]总要面对不要想着 放弃
[01:39.90][00:55.70]生命还没结速自然就有它的目的
[01:43.32][00:59.10]
[01:43.84][00:59.55]难道不是爱　这是爱　不变的爱
[01:47.48][01:03.33]她的每一步　比常人走得快
[01:51.10][01:06.94]可以是无奈　可以是　无比精彩
[01:54.80][01:10.65]爸爸走了妈妈不弃小孩
[01:13.92]
[01:15.03]她沉默　她认错　她错过钟声的生活
[01:21.82]可诗篇里　也没有人　世情能看破
[01:25.70]爱情只深夜一现过　最後又结了果
[01:58.19][01:28.97]
[01:58.98]A young girl only seventeen, young like the evergreens,
[02:03.44]lookin’ at life like a portal for the immortal
[02:06.45]and life took a trip on her makin’ her wife of a man
[02:10.76]who wasn’t man enough just to hold her for life,
[02:13.49] he left soon after the child was born with scorn
[02:16.85]and she mourned everyday and every night but with might
[02:20.76]and prayer and she found freedom,
[02:23.14]awareness and then she walked strong with her child in arm
[02:27.24]
[02:58.52][02:42.69][02:27.96]难道不是爱　这是爱　不变的爱
[03:01.88][02:46.02][02:31.36]她的每一步　比常人走得快
[03:05.55][02:49.76][02:34.99]可以是无奈　可以是　无比精彩
[03:09.25][02:53.41][02:38.65]就算是安排　至少自己安排
[03:12.50][02:56.95][02:42.08]
