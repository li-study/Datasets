[00:03.64]Phoenix
[00:04.68]
[00:16.63]They say an end can be a start
[00:19.06]Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
[00:20.70]It's like a bad day that never ends
[00:22.97]I feel the chaos around me
[00:24.91]A thing I don't try to deny
[00:26.88]I'd better learn to accept that
[00:28.82]There are things in my life that I can't control
[00:31.01]They say love ain't nothing but a sore
[00:32.86]I don't even know what love is
[00:34.91]Too many tears have had to fall
[00:36.99]Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
[00:38.86]I have known terror dizzy spells
[00:40.99]Finding out the secrets words won't tell
[00:43.04]Whatever it is it can't be named
[00:44.87]There's a part of my world that' s fading away
[00:46.83]You know I don't want to be clever
[00:48.93]To be brilliant or superior
[00:50.71]True like ice, true like fire
[00:53.02]Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
[00:55.03]Now I know there's much more dignity
[00:56.92]In defeat than in the brightest victory
[00:58.93]I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
[01:00.98]Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please If I ever feel better
[01:07.12]Remind me to spend some good time with you
[01:11.03]You can give me your number
[01:15.17]When it's all over I'll let you know
[01:17.84]
[01:19.10]Hang on to the good days
[01:21.16]I can lean on my friends
[01:23.14]They help me going through hard times
[01:27.08]But I'm feeding the enemy
[01:29.18]I'm in league with the foe
[01:31.20]Blame me for what's happening
[01:32.65]I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...
[01:35.26]No one knows the hard times I went through
[01:37.52]If happiness came I miss the call
[01:39.38]The stormy days ain't over
[01:41.22]I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
[01:43.30]Now I've watched all my castles fall
[01:45.22]They were made of dust, after all
[01:47.17]Someday all this mess will make me laugh
[01:49.07]I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
[01:51.73]If I ever feel better
[01:55.31]Remind me to spend some good time with you
[01:59.60]You can give me your number
[02:03.26]When it's all over I'll let you know
[02:07.44]If I ever feel better
[02:11.32]Remind me to spend some good time with you
[02:15.35]You can give me your number
[02:19.36]When it's all over I'll let you know
[02:22.09]
[02:23.32]It's like somebody took my place
[02:25.46]I ain't even playing my own game
[02:27.52]The rules have changed well I didn't know
[02:29.29]There are things in my life I can't control
[02:31.32]I feel the chaos around me
[02:33.30]A thing I don't try to deny
[02:35.29]I'd better learn to accept that
[02:37.28]There's a part of my life that will go away
[02:39.29]Dark is the night, cold is the ground
[02:41.24]In the circular solitude of my heart
[02:43.30]As one who strives a hill to climb
[02:45.36]I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
[02:47.39]They say an end can be a start
[02:49.33]Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
[02:51.31]I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
[02:53.40]Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please
[02:55.93]If I ever feel better
[02:59.42]Remind me to spend some good time with you
[03:03.42]You can give me your number
[03:07.43]When it's all over I'll let you know
[03:11.47]If I ever feel better

[03:19.52]You can give me your number
[03:23.53]When it's all over I'll let you know
[03:27.59]If I ever feel better
[03:31.52]Remind me to spend some good time with you
[03:35.53]You can give me your number
[03:39.60]When it's all over I'll let you know
[03:42.28]
