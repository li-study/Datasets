[00:19]
[00:20]Sung By "Glenn Frey"
[00:27]
[00:28]I know you need a friend
[00:32]Someone you can talk to
[00:35]Who will understand what you're going through
[00:41]When it comes to love
[00:45]There's no easy answer
[00:48]Only you can say what you're gonna do
[00:56]- Chorus -
[00:57]I heard you on the phone
[01:01]You took his number
[01:04]Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
[01:10]Isn't he the guy
[01:13]The guy who left you cryin'
[01:16]Isn't he the one who made you blue
[01:28]When you remember those nights in his arms
[01:34]You know you've gotta make up your mind
[01:39]- Chorus -
[01:42]Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
[01:48]Or are you going back to the one you love
[01:55]Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
[02:01]Someone's gonna thank the stars above
[02:07]- Instrumental bridge -
[02:36]What you gonna say when he comes over
[02:42]There's no easy way to see this through
[02:49]All the broken dreams
[02:52]All the disappointments
[02:56]Oh girl -- What you gonna do
[03:03]Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
[03:09]But still you've gotta make up your mind
[03:15]- Chorus -
[03:18]Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
[03:23]Or are you going back to the one you love
[03:30]Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
[03:37]Someone's gonna thank the stars above
[04:19]
[04:20]The End.
