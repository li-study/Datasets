[00:05.00]搜啦EP
[00:07.04]You\'re going crazy
[00:08.78]Running on empty
[00:12.02]You can\'t make up your mind
[00:15.25]You tried to hide it
[00:16.90]But you had to say it
[00:20.24]Restless all this time
[00:23.06]So completely drained from
[00:25.83]Everything that\'s in your life
[00:30.77]It\'s so wrong but you had to scream
[00:34.27]Every thought you\'d kept inside
[02:29.47][01:39.43][00:37.57]One minute you laugh
[01:43.02][00:40.89]The next minute you\'re slowly
[02:35.20][01:45.30][00:43.27]Sinking into something black
[01:50.75][00:48.78]I get the feeling that lately
[02:43.10][01:53.06][00:50.96]Nothing ever really lasts
[01:58.37][00:56.69]I keep trying to get up
[02:50.34][02:00.46][00:58.44]but I keep falling back
[02:53.26][02:03.54][01:01.62]And you love
[02:54.28][02:04.47][01:02.44]and you hate
[02:55.30][02:05.25][01:03.17]and you wait
[02:06.23][01:04.18]Cause one minute goes fast
[01:08.89]You just can\'t escape it
[01:10.40]You\'re losing patience
[01:12.64]You wonder what went wrong
[01:16.54]Everything changes
[01:18.32]Happy then jaded
[01:21.44]Always a different song
[01:25.04]Playing in your head just
[01:27.96]When you think you\'ve got it down
[01:31.94]Out of nowhere you realize
[01:35.48]It\'s different music playing now
[03:00.31][02:21.54][02:14.65]One minute goes fast
[02:32.94]The next minute you\'re slowly
[02:40.78]I get the feeling that lately
[02:48.51]I keep trying to get up
[02:56.00]Cause one minute goes
[02:57.79]One minute goes
