[00:03.00]Meav Ni Mhaolchatha
[00:05.00]Album: Meav
[00:07.00]
[00:23.80]I wish my love was a red, red rose
[00:29.00]growing in yon garden fair
[00:34.00]And I to be the gardener
[00:38.50]of her I would take care
[00:44.50]There's not a month throughout the year
[00:50.00]but my love I'd renew
[00:55.00]I'd garnish her with flowers fine
[01:01.00]sweet William, Thyme and Rue
[01:06.00]
[01:13.00]I wish I was a butterfly
[01:17.00]I'd light on my love's breast
[01:22.00]And if I was a blue cuckoo
[01:27.50]I'd sing my love to rest
[01:34.00]And if I was a nightingale
[01:38.50]I'd sing to daylight clear
[01:43.50]I'd sit and sing with you, Molly
[01:49.00]for once I loved you dear
[01:55.00]
[02:38.00]I wish I was in Dublin town,
[02:43.00]and seated on the grass
[02:49.00]In my right hand, a jug of punch, and on my knee, a lass
[02:59.00]I'd call for liquor freely and I'd pay before I'd go
[03:08.50]I'd roll my Molly in my arms, let the wind blow high or low
