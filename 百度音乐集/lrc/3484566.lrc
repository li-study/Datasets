[00:02.00]Sarah Brightman - Symphony
[00:16.00]
[00:24.62]I don't know what I'm suppose to say
[00:29.95]When love suddenly you feels so far away
[00:36.18]But you're not prepared, you took
[00:39.46]And if you're now afraid to listen
[00:43.15]And I don't want to do this anymore
[00:47.91]
[00:49.30]Why don't know which way that I should turn
[00:54.99]Seems the morning love we know we have to learn
[01:01.40]And I keep staring at your space
[01:04.22]Like it somehow has the answers
[01:07.71]So don't let the music end, all my darling
[01:12.51]
[01:13.22]Symphony
[01:18.11]It's gone quiet around last night
[01:24.99]How I wish you would hold me
[01:28.29]And that you never told me
[01:31.40]And it's better if you leave
[01:36.11]
[01:37.36]Look out the sun
[01:43.24]It's starting to leads all every eye
[01:50.10]But you once spoke so brightly,
[01:53.41]tell me we might be
[01:56.50]That you're going anyway
[02:01.18]
[02:03.90]When you turn, know what she's got, until it's gone
[02:10.07]But then nothing ever hurt like holding on
[02:15.91]I am scared and unprepared and I feel like I have falling
[02:22.52]So can you tell me, where did we go wrong?
[02:27.15]
[02:27.87]Symphony
[02:32.92]It's gone quiet around last night
[02:39.75]How I wish you would hold me
[02:42.92]And that you never told me
[02:46.13]And it's better if you leave
[02:53.17]
[02:54.00]Sarah Brightman - Symphony
[03:08.00]
[03:09.49]But everything is broken
[03:12.60]and it's better that we give up
[03:15.65]And remember how we once had something beautiful
[03:24.39]
[03:26.21]Symphony
[03:32.30]It's gone quiet around last night
[03:38.83]How I wish you would hold me
[03:42.21]And that you never told me
[03:45.38]And it's better if you leave
[03:49.60]
[03:51.52]Look out the sun
[03:57.20]When starting to leads all on every light
[04:04.02]But you once spoke so brightly,
[04:07.24]so tell me we might be
[04:10.34]That you're going anyway
[04:17.24]
