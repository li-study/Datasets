[00:06.15] [Announcer]
[00:09.88]Welcome back, to the stage of history
[00:15.35]
[00:15.72][Eminem]
[00:17.00]Yo.. Slim Shady!
[00:22.10]
[00:23.80]I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
[00:25.55]Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
[00:28.68]The only key that I see to defeat you
[00:30.55]would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
[00:33.23]and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
[00:36.16]I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
[00:38.57]
[00:43.30]I ain't tryin to shoot you,
[00:46.00]I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
[00:47.93]Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
[00:49.83]and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
[00:51.05]Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
[00:54.12]Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
[00:56.18]I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
[00:58.83]to fill it full of explosive gasses
[01:00.67]and close it back with a lit match in it
[01:02.13]while I sit back and just hope it catches
[01:04.13]Blow you to fragments
[01:05.54]Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
[00:56.86]
[01:00.14][Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)]
[01:04.46]
[03:30.98][03:21.08][02:19.37][01:17.00][01:06.11]I see the light at the end
[03:32.04][03:22.62][02:20.79][01:18.54][01:08.06]But every time I take a step, it gets dim
[03:34.76][03:25.16][02:23.29][01:21.00][01:10.35]Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
[03:36.51][03:27.14][02:24.96][01:22.50][01:12.50]If so, heaven's got to be better
[03:38.49][03:28.75][02:27.24][01:25.59][01:14.00]But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[01:26.25]
[01:26.55][J-Black]
[01:27.00]Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
[01:29.94]I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
[01:32.00]I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
[01:34.27]Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
[01:37.62]One day we all gon' die
[01:38.91]But when I die, I'ma be so high
[01:40.00]that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
[01:46.00]with the chalk outline still there
[01:47.33]I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
[01:49.72]I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
[01:53.10]Now if I pray everynight (night)
[01:55.20]Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
[01:56.77]You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
[01:59.50]I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
[02:03.15]I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
[02:05.38]Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
[02:08.00]See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
[02:11.63]Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
[02:14.00]Angels greet me but I don't reply back
[02:16.01]Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
[02:29.39]
[02:29.79][Chorus 1/2]
[02:30.22]
[02:30.97][Announcer]
[02:32.00]Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
[02:37.31]Final battle, fight!
[02:39.05]
[02:39.30][Masta Ace]
[02:40.00]Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
[02:42.20]Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
[02:44.18]And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
[02:47.33]Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
[02:50.00]I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
[02:52.04]And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
[02:55.23]My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
[02:57.19]Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
[03:00.70]
[03:02.66]Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
[03:05.00]My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
[03:07.52]My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
[03:10.06]Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
[03:13.00]Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
[03:15.87]I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
[03:18.51]
[03:43.08][Chorus]
[03:43.65]
[03:44.33][J-Black]
[03:45.34]But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
[03:46.61]Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
[03:48.47]Haha..
[03:49.26]
[03:49.67][Announcer]
[03:50.28]Time's up!
[03:52.07]You lose!
