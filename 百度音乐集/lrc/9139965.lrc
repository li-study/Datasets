[00:00.56]It's a shame
[00:04.64]What I thought of her
[00:08.27]When I saw her

[00:15.50]
[00:16.28]It didn't change
[00:20.28]What You thought of her
[00:24.14]She's been Your daughter
[00:27.57]Since she was made
[00:30.93]
[00:31.88]Since I was made
[00:35.67]I've been leaving
[00:39.00]I'd say I'd change
[00:42.97]But I wouldn't believe it
[00:45.75]
