[00:46.99]Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
[00:50.67]Roaming suburban boys
[00:54.48]Mother's got her hairdo to be done
[00:58.20]She says they're too old for toys
[01:02.27]Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
[01:06.19]in this suburban hell
[01:10.32]and in the distance a police car
[01:13.84]to break the suburban spell
[01:19.74]Let's take a ride
[01:22.48]and run with the dogs tonight
[01:25.45]in suburbia
[01:28.64]You can't hide
[01:30.24]Run with the dogs tonight
[01:33.21]in suburbia
[01:36.06]Break the window by the town hall
[01:39.02]Listen! A siren screams
[01:42.88]there in the distance like a roll call
[01:46.78]of all the suburban dreams
[01:52.63]Let's take a ride
[01:55.73]and run with the dogs tonight
[01:58.38]in suburbia
[02:01.62]You can't hide

[02:06.30]in suburbia
[02:24.21]I only wanted something else to do but hang around
[02:31.82]I only wanted something else to do but hang around
[02:39.50]I only wanted something else to do but hang around
[02:47.28]I only wanted something else to do but hang around
[03:13.99]It's on the front page of the papers
[03:17.74]This is their hour of need
[03:21.64]Where's a policeman when you need one
[03:25.53]to blame the colour TV?
[03:31.37]Let's take a ride
[03:34.16]and run with the dogs tonight
