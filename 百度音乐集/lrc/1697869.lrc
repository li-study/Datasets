[00:20.60]Wait a minute
[00:22.94]Before you walk away
[00:28.61]Let me finish
[00:30.81]I've got a lot to say
[00:36.60]Baby I'm not gonna tolerate
[00:39.43]This game that you play
[00:44.84]You'll regret it
[00:47.00]If you desert me this way
[00:53.43]When there's nobody to dry your eyes
[00:57.30]Suddenly you're gonna realize
[03:23.45][03:07.13][02:50.99][02:02.23][01:46.00][01:01.46]Don't you know

[03:32.70][03:16.47][03:00.49][02:11.83][01:55.44][01:10.87]Before you act so hastily
[03:37.00][03:20.77][03:04.53][02:15.90][01:59.71][01:15.10]Baby remember you need me
[01:21.27]Honey listen
[01:23.57]Don't make a big mistake
[01:27.02]I'm in your system
[01:31.82]You really can't escape
[01:38.00]When there's nobody to hold your hand
[01:41.88]Suddenly you're gonna understand
[02:18.63]No one understands you like I do
[02:22.54]After everything that we've been through
[02:26.66]Baby you can turn around and leave
[02:29.91]But I know that you'll keep coming right back to me
[02:54.98]Don't you see (Don't you see)
[03:11.36]Don't you see(Remember remember you need me)
