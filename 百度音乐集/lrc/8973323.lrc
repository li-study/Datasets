[00:02.00]
[00:06.34]Seek and you will find they say
[00:09.60]But I've been looking everyday
[00:12.48]For a way past this wall that's in front of my face.
[00:15.62]I'm on hands and knees searching for my faith.
[00:19.06]
[00:25.57]I know there's so much at stake
[00:28.79]But I don't know if I can take one more pat
[00:32.25]On the back saying I'll be okay.
[00:34.85]Can't you see me whole life is in disarray?
[00:39.02]You've got me desperate.
[00:41.20]
[00:42.08]I know You hear me, would You give me a sign?
[00:44.99]Reel me in before I've fallen in line.
[00:48.30]You've put me on a path I don't understand
[00:51.55]I'm standing on a ledge waving my hands.
[00:53.66]
[00:54.25]You've got me desperate (do You see me?)
[00:57.72]Desperate (do You hear me?)
[01:00.71]Desperate (will You help me?)
[01:04.35]You've got me desperate.
[01:07.67]
[01:09.01]I know You're my only hope
[01:11.95]The only One who truly knows
[01:14.93]How it feels, what it's like when it all starts to fall
[01:17.99]You're the One I can trust who hears when I call.
[01:22.22]You've got me desperate.
