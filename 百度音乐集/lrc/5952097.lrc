[ti:In my life]
[la:uk]
[00:08]There are places I'll remember
[00:13]All my life though some have changed
[00:18]Some forever not for better
[00:22]Some have gone and some remain
[00:27]All these places have their moments
[00:31]With lovers and friends I still can recall
[00:36]Some are dead and some are living
[00:42]In my life I've loved them all
[00:50]But of all these friends and lovers
[00:55]There is no one compares with you
[00:59]And these memories lose their meaning
[01:04]When I think of love as something new
[01:09]Though I know I'll never lose affection
[01:14]For people and things that went before
[01:18]I know I'll often stop and think about them
[01:23]In my life I love you more
[01:46]Though I know I'll never lose affection
[01:50]For people and things that went before
[01:55]I know I'll often stop and think about them
[02:00]In my life I love you more
[02:10]In my life I love you more
