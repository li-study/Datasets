[00:02.40]The Road To Home
[00:02.85]Amy Macdonald
[00:03.45]
[00:10.91]Oh the leaves are falling from the trees
[00:16.04]And the snow is coming, don’t you know?
[00:21.32]But I’ll still remember which way to go
[00:26.60]I’m on the road, the road to home
[00:30.81]
[00:32.07]Oh the sound is fading in my ears
[00:37.36]And I can’t believe I’ve lasted all these years
[00:42.66]But I’ll still remember which way to go
[00:47.92]I’m on the road, the road to home
[00:51.93]
[01:14.86]Oh the light is fading all the time
[01:19.95]And this life I’m in it seems to pass me by
[01:25.34]But I’ll still remember which way to go
[01:30.54]I’m on the road, the road to home
[01:34.55]
[01:36.38]Now I must say good bye
[01:41.05]Keep telling myself “now don’t you cry”
[01:46.62]But I’m here where I belong
[01:51.70]I’ll see you soon, it won’t be long
[01:57.00]I’ll see you soon, it won’t be long
[02:02.33]I’ll see you soon, it won’t be long
[02:09.51]
[03:33.26]I don`t know if you can see
[03:37.34]The changes that have come over me
[03:43.03]In these last few days I`ve been afraid
[03:47.19]That I might drift away
[03:50.71]So I`ve been telling old stories, singing songs
[03:56.18]That make me think about where I came from
[04:00.91]And that`s the reason why I seem
[04:05.85]So far away today
[04:10.41]Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
[04:14.80]That I think about you all the time
[04:20.09]Caledonia you`re calling me
[04:23.72]And now I`m going home
[04:29.15]If I should become a stranger
[04:32.94]You know that it would make me more than sad
[04:38.46]Caledonia`s been everything
[04:42.12]I`ve ever had
[04:47.66]Caledonia`s been everything
[04:51.90]I`ve ever had
[04:54.17]
