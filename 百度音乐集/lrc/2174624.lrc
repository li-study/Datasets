[00:08.07]Rosemary
[00:11.43]Heaven restores you in life
[00:15.55]You're coming with me
[00:18.33]Through the aging, the fearing and the strife
[00:20.61]It's the smiling on the package
[00:23.45]It's the faces in the sand
[00:25.53]It's the thought that moves you upwards
[00:27.10]Embracing me with two hands
[00:29.69]Right will take you places
[00:31.02]Yeah maybe to the beach
[00:33.14]When your friends they do come crying
[00:34.71]Tell them how your pleasure's set up on slow-release
[00:40.26]Hey, wait
[00:43.56]Great smile
[00:47.54]Sensitive to faith - not
[00:51.45]Denial
[00:54.65]But hey who is on trial?
[00:58.81]It took a lifespan
[01:01.03]With no cellmate
[01:02.96]The long way back
[01:07.03]Sandy why can't we look the other way?
[01:10.98]We speaks about travel
[01:19.45]Yeah, we think about the land
[01:21.58]We smart like all people
[01:23.72]Feeling real tan
[01:25.70]I can take you places
[01:27.77]Do you need a new man?
[01:30.42]Wipe the pollen from the faces
[01:36.01]Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van
[01:37.79]Hey, wait
[01:40.09]Great smile
[01:43.64]Sensitive to faith - not
[01:46.47]Denial
[01:50.69]But hey who is on trial?
[01:54.75]It took a lifespan
[01:57.19]With no cellmate
[01:59.37]Find a long way back
[02:04.85]Saying, meanwhile can't we look the other way?
[02:07.15]You're weightless, you are exotic
[02:10.49]You need something for which to care
[02:14.67]Sandy why can't we look the other way?
[02:33.70]Leave some shards under the belly
[02:35.01]Lay some grease inside my hand
[02:37.90]It's a sentimental jury
[02:39.01]And the makings of a good plan
[02:41.14]You've come to love me lightly
[02:42.76]Yeah you've come to hold me tight
[02:44.63]Is this motion everlasting
[02:46.70]Or do shutters pass in the night?
[02:48.78]Rosemary
[02:52.22]Oh heaven restores you in life
[02:55.77]I spent a lifespan with no cellmate
[02:58.60]The long way back
[03:03.15]Sandy why can't we look the other way?
[03:07.01]You're weightless, semi-erotic
[03:10.64]You need someone to take you there
[03:14.90]Sandy why can't we look the other way?
[03:18.75]Why can't we just play the other game?
[03:22.68]Why can't we just look the other way?
