[00:02.98]
[00:05.91]oh~
[00:10.27]He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
[00:19.77]But it tears her apart \'cause nothing\'s for her heart
[00:29.63]He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
[00:40.64]If he could only read her mind, she\'d say...
[00:47.77]
[00:48.11]Buy me a rose, call me from work
[00:53.17]Open a door for me, what would it hurt
[00:57.86]Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
[01:04.02]These are the little things I need the most in my life
[01:11.53]yeah~
[01:18.66]Now the days have grown to years of feelin\' all alone
[01:27.10]As she sits and wonders if all she\'s doin\' is wrong
[01:38.13]\'Cause lately she\'d try anything just to turn his head
[01:48.75]Would it make a difference if she said, if she said...
[01:56.00]
[01:56.68]Buy me a rose, call me from work
[02:01.67]Open a door for me, what would it hurt
[02:06.50]Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
[02:12.70]These are the little things I need the most in my life
[02:19.56]
[02:22.15]And the more that he lives the less that he tries
[02:27.31]To show her the love that he holds inside
[02:32.04]And the more that she gives the more that he sees
[02:37.17]This is the story of you... and me
[02:45.22]So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
[02:50.50]To open the door to a heart that I hurt
[02:55.37]And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
[03:01.75]\'Cause I\'m gonna make things right for the rest of your life
[03:11.77]And I\'m gonna hold you tonight, tonight
[03:18.90]Do all those little things for the rest of your life
