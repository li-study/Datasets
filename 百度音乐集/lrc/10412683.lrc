[00:07.64]ahh~~ahh~~~
[00:16.12]ahh~~ahh~~~
[00:27.05]I don’t want you to go
[00:29.53]even if you’re tellin’ me
[00:32.20]You’ve gotten over me girl
[00:36.12]Cuz lately I realized without you
[00:41.64]I can’t live another day
[00:44.20]
[00:44.86]So do we try to make this work, or do we part ways?
[00:48.15]Cuz as much as it hurts, what we have’s worth all the pain flowing through the blood in my veins
[00:53.48]And it’s still not enough, feel the melody of love through the beat of my heart
[00:56.97]We can never be apart, from the lands to the seas, to the stars, wherever you are
[01:01.16]
[01:01.45]Girl just hear me out, cuz I got somethin’ to say
[01:06.52]You hear me callin’ but still walkin’ away
[01:11.02]This pain inside just won’t go away
[01:16.02]Babe I can’t watch you slippin’ away
[01:19.26]
[01:19.27]Dark Man X, I’m slipping
[01:20.20]Grip on my heart, tapped out from submission
[01:22.53]Better provision is what her heart’s wishing
[01:24.92]But she don’t seem to understand my position
[01:27.31]I admit, I don’t have what it takes
[01:29.11]To serve and provide what she wants on her plate
[01:31.36]So I put her in place, then I’m closing the gates
[01:33.54]Locking the chains, no intention to wait, wait
[01:36.11]Should’ve treated you better
[01:38.24]Had I known from the start
[01:40.05]There’d be distance between us
[01:42.57]I would have kept us from growin’ apart
[01:46.05]And I apologize
[01:48.01]I’d do whatever that it takes girl
[01:51.41]If I can keep you from goin’ away
[01:53.78]
[01:53.86]Girl just hear me out, cuz I got somethin’ to say
[01:58.98]You hear me callin’ but still walkin’ away
[02:03.42]This pain inside just won’t go away
[02:08.52]Babe I can’t watch you slippin’ away
[02:12.20]
