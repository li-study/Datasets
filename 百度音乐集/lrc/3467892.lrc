[00:05.23]Subterranean Homesick Alien
[00:11.13]Radiohead
[00:29.19]The breath of the morning
[00:31.66]I keep forgetting.
[00:33.96]The smell of the warm summer air.
[00:37.64]
[00:38.64]I live in a town
[00:40.86]where you can't smell a thing,
[00:43.85]you watch your feet
[00:45.78]for cracks in the pavement.
[00:54.04]
[00:58.18]Up above
[01:00.34]aliens hover
[01:02.33]making home movies
[01:04.88]for the folks back home,
[01:06.58]
[01:07.34]of all these weird creatures
[01:09.48]who lock up their spirits,
[01:11.91]drill holes in themselves
[01:14.13]and live for their secrets.
[01:23.91]
[01:26.35]They're all uptight, uptight,
[01:37.26]uptight, uptight,
[01:46.46]uptight, uptight.
[01:58.32]
[02:09.32]I wish that they'd sweep down in a country lane,
[02:14.25]late at night when I'm driving.
[02:18.96]Take me on board their beautiful ship,
[02:24.09]show me the world as I'd love to see it.
[02:36.78]
[02:38.03]I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me,
[02:42.50]They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely.
[02:47.70]I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life.
[02:52.11]They'd shut me away.
[02:57.46]But I'd be alright, alright,
[03:07.74]I'd be alright,
[03:13.36]I'm alright.
[03:17.65]
[03:18.49]I'm just uptight, uptight,
[03:29.41]uptight, uptight,
[03:39.63]uptight, uptight,
[03:49.21]uptight, uptight,
[04:01.07]uptight.
