[00:08.64]"Lyric sync: Philip Huang"
[00:10.65]Ooooo
[00:11.63]Just a mean black set of wheels
[00:14.34]What it takes to get me off
[00:17.48]I'm gonna drive all night
[00:19.00]Spin my wheels of light
[00:20.47]It feels all right
[00:23.27]It feels all right
[00:26.22]I don't need no drivers license
[00:29.24]I'm too reckless to survive
[00:32.27]It's like a carburetor instigator
[00:35.81]Feels all right
[00:38.32]It feels all right
[00:41.10]Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
[00:47.15]It's got solid gold
[00:50.21]Hubcaps
[00:53.01]It makes me feel like a king
[00:55.99]I only need one thing
[00:58.99]And that's a Slick Black Cadillac
[01:04.74](Get it up)
[01:10.21]Slow down
[01:13.60]You know I got a fully
[01:15.07]Equipped rock 'n' roll machine
[01:17.17]At speeds that take me high, high, high
[01:20.07]At dead man's curve
[01:21.39]I only hear one word
[01:23.18]Drive, drive, drive
[01:26.13]Drive, drive, drive
[01:28.73]My machine is making headlines
[01:31.61]It gives me love and everything
[01:34.55]It's like an institution of revolution
[01:37.92]It feels all right
[01:40.04]It feels all right
[01:43.31]Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
[01:48.81]It's got solid gold
[01:52.78]Hubcaps
[01:55.30]It makes me feel like a king
[01:58.66]I only need one thing
[02:01.01]And that's a Slick Black Cadillac
[02:06.50](Pull over, woooo)
[02:10.14]"Guitar solo..."
[02:19.47]Cadillac, Cadillac, Cadillac

[02:40.55]Just for me an A.P.B., yeah yeah
[02:43.97]The sirens spinnin'
[02:45.33]It's me who's winnin'
[02:46.80]There're after me
[02:49.41]There're after me
[02:52.31]Oh, I know just what happened
[02:55.21]I disappeared to their surprise
[02:58.16]I got a Cadillac marquee by my back
[03:01.27]And I don't mind
[03:03.32]No no
[03:04.66]I don't mind
[03:06.95]Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
[03:12.98]It's got solid gold
[03:16.01]Hubcaps
[03:18.61]It makes me feel like a king
[03:21.76]I only need one thing

[03:39.57]Hubcaps
[03:42.79]Slick Black Cadillac
[03:47.94]I lay it down
[03:49.61]Spin 'em wide
[03:51.12]And get laid in back
