[00:00.19]Clare Maguire - This Is Not The End
[00:03.12].
[00:05.52]If it be your will to speak
[00:13.14]Of memories we often shared
[00:20.89]Talk to me of days gone by
[00:28.10]Think of love and not despair
[00:35.03].
[00:36.22]And when I''m gone
[00:39.60]We''ll meet again
[00:42.97]As often do the closest friends
[00:50.16]So dry your eyes
[00:53.35]And lay me down
[00:57.10]I tell you this is not the end
[01:03.72].
[01:04.22]And if someone else
[01:09.10]Must take my place
[01:10.97]For I''ll be gone the longest time
[01:17.35]I''ll wait and I will understand
[01:24.16]A heart of thorns must
[01:27.76]Leave the mind
[01:30.76].
[01:31.20]But when in time I see your face
[01:38.01]The scars will fade
[01:41.07]The heart will mend
[01:44.44]So dry your eyes
[01:47.70]And lay me down
[01:51.51]I tell you this is not the end
[01:58.32].
[01:59.26]And from today I wish you joy
[02:06.63]From this day I wish you peace
[02:13.01]I hope that life will pass you by
[02:19.70]As softly as the falling leaves
[02:26.45].
[02:26.88]And when your heart is full again
[02:33.57]Raise a glass for me my friend
[02:40.70]And dry your eyes
[02:43.82]And lay me down
[02:47.51]I tell you this is not the end
[02:54.43]Oh dry your eyes
[02:58.75]And lay me down
[03:04.68]I tell you this is not the end
