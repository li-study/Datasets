[00:01.12]Revive - Distant Memories
[00:08.48]
[00:18.15]Flash forward a century
[00:20.97]In an overgrown cemetery
[00:24.03]My tombstone lays so peacefully
[00:30.10]Dirt and grime over time
[00:33.03]slowly cover up the line:
[00:36.04]“He lived a full life,
[00:37.86]and so wonderfully”
[00:41.19]But no one remembers
[00:43.76]that life I’m just history
[02:41.52][01:53.53]I’m just history
[02:48.12][02:00.11][00:54.30]Nothing more than distant little memories
[02:54.21][02:05.54][01:00.22]But I am in a place where I
[02:57.09][02:09.08][01:03.15]never felt more home
[02:59.87][02:12.02][01:06.05]And now my old life seems to be Nothing more
[03:03.85][02:16.14][01:09.66]than distant memories
[03:16.00][01:20.82]
[01:23.95]Sadness strangely fills the mind
[01:26.89]Of a young girl trying to find where
[01:29.80]They say her great grandfather lies
[01:36.07]And as she gazes at the stone
[01:38.80]Of a man she’s never known
[01:41.94]She doesn’t think that’ll be her one day
[01:47.13]Where no one remembers your life
[02:28.53]
[02:28.96]We forget the treasure to come
[02:32.08]In a life that won’t let us down
[02:35.07]Where we’re much more than distant memories
