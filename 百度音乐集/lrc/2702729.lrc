[00:19.77]I'm tired of telling the story
[00:23.53]Tired of telling it your way
[00:26.61]Yeh I know what I saw
[00:30.01]I know that I found the floor
[00:33.77]
[00:35.14]Before you take my heart, reconsider
[00:42.70]Before you take my heart, reconsider
[00:50.20]I've opened the door
[00:54.18]I've opened the door
[00:55.97]Here comes the summer's son
[01:00.22]He burns my skin
[01:04.01]I ache again
[01:07.84]I'm over you
[01:09.23]
[01:13.18]I thought I had a dream to hold
[01:16.34]Maybe that has gone
[01:20.28]Your hands reach out and touch me still
[01:23.21]But this feels so wrong
[01:26.31]
[01:28.83]Before you take my heart, reconsider
[01:34.80]Before you take my heart, reconsider
[01:43.22]I've opened the door
[01:46.91]I've opened the door
[01:49.09]
[01:49.38]Here comes the summer's son
[01:53.02]He burns my skin
[01:56.79]I ache again
[01:59.13]I'm over you
[02:04.16]Here comes the winter's rain
[02:09.81]To cleanse my skin
[02:12.34]I wake again
[02:15.12]I'm over you
