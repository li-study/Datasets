[00:25.57]It seems as though he wants to cry (Oh, I),
[00:30.10]and he’s been acting really strange
[00:33.57]He starts talkin’ and I tuned him out
[00:36.91]It doesn’t matter anyway
[00:41.59]Because I knew as soon as I saw clouds, yea

[01:09.60]the way you break everything that comes in your way
[01:13.90]Just like a hurricane, Just like a hurricane,
[01:17.81]the way you broke my heart and now I’m left with the pain
[01:22.25]After the hurricane
