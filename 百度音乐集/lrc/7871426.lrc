[01:16.44]
[02:02.08]Lost in the sky
[02:05.87]Clouds roll by and i roll with them
[02:11.15]Arrows fly
[02:15.16]Seas increase and then fall again
[02:19.85]This world is spinning around me
[02:24.52]This world is spinning without me
[02:29.24]Every day sends future to past
[02:33.85]Every breath leaves one less to my last
[02:39.07]
[02:57.40]Watch the sparrow falling
[02:59.36]Gives new meaning to it all
[03:01.56]If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day
[03:06.01]
[03:06.79]I'll take seven lives for one
[03:08.54]And then my only father's son
[03:10.84]As sure as i ever did love him
[03:13.94]I am not afraid
[03:16.34]This world is spinning around me
[03:21.17]The whole world keeps spinning around me
[03:25.66]All life is future to past
[03:30.25]Every breath leaves me one less to my last
[03:34.36]
[03:45.27]Pull me under
[03:47.55]pull me under
[03:49.89]Pull me under i'm not afraid
[03:54.66]All that i feel is honor and spite
[03:59.29]All i can do is to set it right
[04:06.36]
[04:14.36]Dust fills my eyes
[04:18.33]Clouds roll by and i roll with them
[04:24.54]Centuries cry
[04:27.70]Orders fly and i fall again
[04:31.56]
[04:32.88]This world is spinning inside me
[04:36.87]The whole world is spinning inside of me
[04:41.24]Every day sends future to past
[04:46.45]Every step brings me closer to my last
[04:51.34]
[05:10.95]Pull me under
[05:13.10]pull me under
[05:15.31]Pull me under i'm not afraid
[05:20.20]Living my life too much in the sun
[05:24.87]Only until your will is done
[05:29.71]
[06:35.15]Pull me under
[06:37.46]pull me under
[06:39.82]Pull me under i'm not afraid
[06:44.59]All that i feel is honor and spite
[06:49.38]All i can do is to set it right
[06:54.29]Pull me under
[06:56.47]pull me under
[06:58.67]Pull me under i'm not afraid
[07:03.29]Living my life too much in the sun
[07:08.05]Only until your will is done
[07:26.88]
[07:50.40](chorus ) 'oh that this too
[08:00.25]Too solid flesh would melt.'
