[00:29.75]Show me how you do that trick
[00:33.25]The one that makes me scream he said
[00:36.93]The one that makes me laugh he said
[00:40.48]And threw his arms around my neck
[00:44.26]Show me how you do it
[00:47.34]And I promise you I promise that
[00:51.00]I'll run away with you
[00:54.65]I'll run away with you
[00:58.42]
[01:13.24]Spinning on that dizzy edge
[01:16.59]I kissed his face and kissed his head
[01:20.63]And dreamed of all the different ways I had
[01:25.25]To make him glow
[01:27.92]Why are you so far away, he said
[01:32.02]Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
[01:38.61]That I'm in love with you
[01:42.67]You, soft and only
[01:46.24]You,lost and lonely
[01:50.06]You, strange as angels
[01:54.36]Dancing in the deepest oceans
[01:57.50]Twisting in the water
[01:59.73]You're just like a dream
[02:03.61]You're just like a dream
[02:07.20]
[02:30.48]Daylight licked me into shape
[02:33.88]I must have been asleep for days
[02:37.68]And moving lips to breathe his name
[02:41.46]I opened up my eyes
[02:44.75]And found myself alone
[02:47.40]Alone alone above a raging sea
[02:52.00]That stole the only boy I loved
[02:56.11]And drowned him deep inside of me
[03:00.20]You, soft and only
[03:03.48]You, lost and lonely
[03:07.03]You, just like heaven
[03:12.51]
[03:14.28]You, soft and only
[03:17.97]You, lost and lonely
[03:21.84]You, just like heaven
