[00:02.04]Ghost
[00:02.75]Little Boots
[00:07.17]Withdraw into your other world
[00:09.61]I'm speaking but you do not hear a word
[00:13.07]Glaze over colder than a lake
[00:15.90]Frozen by our distances of late
[00:18.99]It's clear as glass you smash
[00:21.34]My apparitions melt before your eyes
[00:25.00]My skull is full of dreams and nothing's as it seems
[00:29.07]In the black air under the trees
[00:31.56]Do you even know that I'm here? I might as well be a ghost
[00:35.14]It's true, you walk right through me
[00:38.54]Look in the mirror and you, you see nothing but yourself
[00:41.52]It's true, I see right through you
[00:47.82]It's true, you walk right through me
[00:53.98]It's true, I see right through you
[01:03.57]Blank pages surrounding your eyes
[01:06.39]Overthrow the colors in your mind
[01:09.99]Science has always been a liar
[01:12.73]I can see you shiver in my fire
[01:15.45]I'm falling like a snowflake
[01:18.29]Catch me quick before I disappear
[01:21.69]I'm fading like the sun
[01:24.38]And soon as I'm gone everything will come undone
[01:31.68]Do you even know that I'm here? I might as well be a ghost
[01:35.15]It's true, you walk right through me
[01:38.01]Look in the mirror and you, you see nothing but yourself
[01:41.52]It's true, I see right through you
[01:44.93]Do you even know that I'm here? I might as well be a ghost
[01:47.85]It's true, you walk right through me
[01:50.66]Look in the mirror and you, you see nothing but yourself
[01:54.16]It's true, I see right through you
[02:00.46]It's true, you walk right through me
[02:06.75]It's true, I see right through you
[02:13.10]It's true, you walk right through me
[02:19.12]It's true, I see right through you
[02:25.72]It's true, you walk right through me
[02:32.05]It's true, I see right through you
[02:38.39]It's true, you walk right through me
[02:44.70]It's true, I see right through you
