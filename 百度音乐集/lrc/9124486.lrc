[00:01.06]The whispers in the morning
[00:07.83]of lovers sleeping tight
[00:14.56]Are rolling like thunder now
[00:21.17]as I look in your eyes.
[00:27.86]I hold on to your body
[00:34.57]and feel each move you make.
[00:41.57]Your voice is warm and tender
[00:45.68]A love that I could not forsake.
[04:06.89][02:15.10][00:55.19]Cause I am your lady
[04:13.74][02:21.75][01:02.26]And you are my man.
[04:20.02][02:28.34][01:08.61]Whenever you reach for me
[04:26.77][02:35.01][01:15.32]I'll do all that I can.
[04:33.39][03:17.59]We're heading for something
[04:39.79][03:21.47]Somewhere I've never been.
[05:13.07][04:46.46][03:27.74]Sometimes I am frightened but
[05:28.26][04:49.55][03:31.46]I'm ready to learn
[05:30.01][04:53.27][03:34.71]of the power of love.
[04:59.60]Woo the power of love
[05:06.11]The power of love
[01:22.43]Lost is how I'm feeling
[01:29.14]lying in your arms.
[01:35.66]When the world outside's too much to take.
[01:41.92]That all ends when I'm with you.
[01:48.70]Even though there may be times
[01:55.34]it seems I'm far away.
[02:01.80]But never wonder where I am
[03:47.25]The sound of your heart beating.
[03:50.51]Made it clear suddenly.
[03:53.70]The feeling that I can't go on
[04:00.41]is light years away.
