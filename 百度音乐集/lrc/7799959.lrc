[02:03.53][00:08.27]
[00:15.89]Why am I standing on a cloud
[00:19.45]Every time you're around
[00:23.10]And my sadness disappears
[00:26.65]Every time you are near
[01:14.21][00:30.84]You must be an angel
[01:16.91][00:33.84]I can see it in your eyes
[01:20.47][00:37.37]Full of wonder and surprise
[01:24.38][00:40.95]And just now I realize
[01:42.99][01:28.82][00:45.43]Oooh you're an angel
[01:46.82][01:32.38][00:49.19]Oooh you're an angel
[01:50.38][01:35.98][00:52.78]Oooh you're an angel
[01:53.28][01:38.89][00:55.38]In disguise, I can see it in your eyes
[00:59.20]Walking down a crowded avenue
[01:02.62]Other faces seem like nothing next to you
[01:06.25]And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
[01:09.80]Just the pounding of my heart and that's why
[02:09.79][01:58.15]
[02:12.53]You're an angel
[02:16.47]You're an angel, baby
[02:20.03]You're an angel
[02:22.79]You must be an angel
[02:25.74]Now I believe that dreams come true
[02:29.11]'Cause you came when I wished for you
[02:32.76]This just can't be coincidence
[02:36.51]The only way that this makes sense is that
[02:55.26][02:40.90]Oooh you're an angel
[02:58.84][02:44.40]Oooh you're an angel
[03:02.40][02:48.05]Oooh you're an angel
[03:05.10][02:50.95]In disguise, I can see it in your eyes
[03:10.54]You're an angel
[03:13.93]You're an angel, baby
[03:17.71]You're an angel
[03:20.47]You must be an angel, baby
[03:24.47]
[03:33.13]Clouds just disappear
[03:44.34][03:37.18]
