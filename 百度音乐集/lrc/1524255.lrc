[00:01.50]
[00:06.93]Oh the weather outside is frightful
[00:10.32]But the fire is so delightful
[00:13.63]And since we've no place to go
[00:16.99]Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
[00:20.04]
[00:20.59]It doesn't show signs of stopping
[00:23.93]And I've brought some corn for popping
[00:27.23]The lights are turned way down low
[00:30.47]Let is snow, let it snow, let it snow
[00:33.45]
[00:34.01]When we finally kiss goodnight
[00:37.74]How I hate going out in the storm
[00:41.04]But if you really hold me tight
[00:44.49]All the way home I'll be warm
[00:47.53]The fire is slowly dying
[00:50.78]And my dear we're still goodbye-ing
[00:54.06]As long as you love me so
[00:57.22]Let it snow, let snow, let it snow
[01:00.20]Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping
[01:03.97]And I've brought some corn for popping
[01:07.28]Oh the lights are turned way down low
[01:10.48]Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
[01:13.52]OH... let it snow
[01:15.18]
[01:27.51]All the way home I'll be warm
[01:30.68]The fire is slowly dying
[01:33.45]And my dear I'm still goodbye-ing
[01:36.75]As long you love me so
[01:39.94]Let it snow, Let it Snow, Let it snow
[01:43.24]Let it snow, Let is snow, Let is snow
