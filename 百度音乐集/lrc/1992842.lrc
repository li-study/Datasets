[00:13]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[00:28]You been out ridin' fences for so long now
[00:35]Oh, you're a hard one
[00:38]I know that you got your reasons
[00:43]These things that are pleasin' you
[00:48]Can hurt you somehow
[00:53]Don' you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
[00:58]She'll beat you if she's able
[01:02]You know the queen of heats is always your best bet
[01:09]Now it seems to me, some fine things
[01:13]Have been laid upon your table
[01:17]But you only want the ones that you can't get
[01:24]Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no youger
[01:34]Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
[01:41]And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
[01:49]Your prison is walking through this world all alone
[01:57]Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
[02:03]The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
[02:07]It's hard to tell the night time from the day
[02:13]You're loosin' all your highs and lows
[02:19]Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
[02:28]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[02:39]Come down from your fences, open the gate
[02:46]It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
[02:53]You better let somebody love you, before it's too late
