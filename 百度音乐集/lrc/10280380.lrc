[00:01.00]Melody Gardot - If the Stars Were Mine
[00:03.00]
[00:08.02]If the stars were mine
[00:10.54]I'd give them all to you
[00:13.20]I'd pluck them down right from the sky
[00:15.35]and leave it only blue
[00:17.27]I would never let the sun
[00:18.84]forget to shine upon your face
[00:21.40]so when others would have rain clouds
[00:23.79]you'd have only sunny days
[00:26.12]If the stars were mine
[00:28.19]I'd tell you what I'd do
[00:30.28]I'd put the stars right in a jar
[00:32.75]and give 'em all to you
[00:36.28]
[00:38.11]If the birds were mine
[00:40.14]I'd tell them when to sing
[00:42.31]I'd make them sing a sonnet
[00:44.25]when your telephone would ring
[00:46.68]I would put them there inside the square,
[00:48.96]whenever you went out
[00:51.08]so there'd always be sweet music
[00:53.05]whenever you would walk about
[00:55.35]If the birds were mine
[00:57.86]I'd tell you what I'd do
[00:59.88]I'd teach the birds such lovely words
[01:02.05]and make 'em sing for you
[01:04.05]I'd teach the birds such lovely words
[01:06.43]and make 'em sing for you
[01:09.97]
[01:40.53]If the world was mine
[01:43.19]I'd paint it gold and green
[01:45.38]I'd make the oceans orange
[01:47.39]for a brilliant color scheme
[01:49.70]I would color all the mountains,
[01:51.78]make the sky forever blue
[01:54.08]So the world would be a painting
[01:56.14]and I'd live inside with you
[01:58.39]If the world was mine
[02:00.74]I'd tell you what I'd do
[02:02.76]I'd wrap the world in ribbons
[02:04.91]and then give it all to you
[02:07.05]I'd teach the birds such lovely words
[02:09.37]and make 'em sing for you
[02:11.35]I'd put those stars right in a jar...and..........
[02:18.27]give them all...to you.......
