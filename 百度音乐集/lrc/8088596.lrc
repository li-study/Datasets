[00:40.22]Let me walk a while down gallows alley
[00:49.17]Mesmerized, alone, behold a sader me
[00:58.80]I am the voices lost, I am the voices passed
[01:07.76]I am the king down gallows alley
[01:15.41]
[01:25.92]I am the foul ones who wintered
[01:34.40]And I grow fire in my eyes
[01:43.01]Am I the minister who dwells there in the night
[02:01.94]
[02:32.07]Come walk beside me now, it's not a strange
[02:40.12]The fall into the grasp of the fellows feigned
[02:49.38]And to be the voices lost, you know we must be fast
[02:58.81]Let's stay a while down gallows alley
[03:08.70]
[03:16.16]I am the foul ones who wintered
[03:24.93]And I grow fire in my eyes
[03:34.99]Am I the minister who dwells there in the night
[03:44.60]
[03:47.23]Come see into those eyes of fire
[03:51.90]Who goes at midnight ride with a fire eyed
[04:22.44]
[04:29.36]I am the foul ones who wintered
[04:37.97]And I grow fire in my eyes
[04:47.99]Am I the minister who dwells there
