[00:14.77]
[00:54.40]He seems alone and silent
[00:58.52]Thoughts remain without an answer
[01:03.36]Afraid and uninvited
[01:06.63]He slowly drifts away
[01:09.61]
[01:12.42]Moved by desire and fear
[01:16.85]Breaking delicate wings
[01:20.35]
[01:21.30]Lifting shadows
[01:24.10]Off a Dream once broken
[01:29.76]She can turn a drop of water
[01:34.79]Into an ocean
[01:37.09]
[02:14.94]As the rain is pouring down
[02:19.21]Tears of sorrow wash his mind
[02:23.63]Drifting with the current
[02:26.86]This stream of life flows on
[02:29.45]
[02:32.34]He seems alone and silent
[02:36.62]Waiting on his hands and knees
[02:40.35]The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly
[02:48.59]
[02:50.58]Moved by desire and fear
[02:54.37]He takes a few steps away
[02:58.36]
[02:59.21]Lifting shadows
[03:01.16]Off a Dream once broken
[03:07.62]She can turn a drop of water
[03:12.45]Into an ocean
[03:15.05]
[03:17.53]And she listens openly
[03:26.51]And she listens openly
[03:33.27]
[04:15.00]He pours his soul into the water
[04:20.97]Reflecting the mystery
[04:25.19]She carries him away
[04:29.27]And the winds die slowly
[04:32.06]
[04:33.66]And she listens openly
[04:41.99]And she listens openly
[04:49.87]
[04:50.89]Lifting shadows
[04:52.87]Off a Dream once broken
[04:59.49]She can turn a drop of water
[05:04.25]Into an ocean
[05:06.73]
