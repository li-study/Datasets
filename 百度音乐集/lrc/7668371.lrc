[00:17.71]Just one kiss on my lips
[00:22.50]was all it took to seal the future
[00:26.57]Just one look from your eyes
[00:30.28]was like a certain kind of torture
[00:34.33]
[00:35.77]Once upon a time
[00:38.74]there was a boy and there was a girl
[00:42.64]Just one touch from your hands

[00:51.18](Chorus:)
[00:51.86]Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
[00:58.99]Forbidden love, forbidden love
[01:05.87]Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever
[01:15.12]Forbidden love, forbidden love

[01:43.11]was all it took to change my fortune
[01:47.32]Just one word from your mouth
