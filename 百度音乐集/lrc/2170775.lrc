[00:06.39]
[00:14.06]Do you know what's worth fighting for,
[00:20.31]When it's not worth dying for?
[00:26.07]Does it take your breath away
[00:30.61]And you feel yourself suffocating?
[00:35.21]
[00:37.71]Does the pain weigh out the pride?
[00:43.47]And you look for a place to hide?
[00:49.10]Did someone break your heart inside?

[01:04.00]Lay down your arms
[01:06.76]Give up the fight
[01:11.00]One, 21 guns
[01:15.00]Throw up your arms into the sky,
[01:21.25]You and I
[01:23.23]
[01:28.20]When you're at the end of the road
[01:33.92]And you lost all sense of control
[01:39.74]And you're throughts have taken their toll
[01:44.28]When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
[01:51.29]Your faith walks on broken glass
[01:57.00]And the hangover doesn't pass
[02:03.00]Nothing's ever built to last
[02:07.42]You're in ruins
[02:09.66]

[02:28.86]Throw up your arms into the sky,
[02:35.12]You and I
[02:36.98]
[02:41.64]Did you try to live on your own
[02:47.30]When you burned down the house and home?
[02:52.64]Did you stand too close to the fire?
[02:56.64]Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
[03:05.78]
[03:41.90]When it's time to live and let die
[03:47.69]And you can't get another try
[03:53.34]Something side this heart has died
[03:57.92]You're in ruins
