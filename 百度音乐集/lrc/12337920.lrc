[00:19.48]I realize I missed a day
[00:21.76]But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
[00:26.21]I look around and see this face
[00:28.90]What the hell have I lost my taste
[00:34.33]Don't want to find out
[00:39.84]Just want to cut out
[00:42.19]
[00:44.19]My head explodes, my ears ring
[00:46.85]I can't remember just where I've been
[00:51.35]The last thing that I recall
[00:53.74]I got lost in a deep black hole
[00:59.06]Don't want to find out

[01:54.97]On the way out, another one
[01:59.20]Would like to know before I stop
[02:01.69]Did I make it or did I flop
