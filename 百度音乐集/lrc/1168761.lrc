[00:-0.50]James Blunt - I Can't Hear The Music

[00:12.12]
[00:16.12]Is it a warning?
[00:19.23]Is it an evil sign?
[00:22.26]Is it a people, who have lost their mind?
[00:28.41]Is it the darkness?
[00:31.45]Is it a man resigned?
[00:34.56]Is it a best friend, leaving you behind?
[00:40.49]Is it ever gonna stop?
[00:43.83]Will they ever let you go?
[00:47.06]You're in a rush, they don't care enough,
[00:50.18]cause their lives are very slow
[00:52.90]
[00:53.37]Time is ticking on
[00:56.27]You don't get a second shot
[00:59.36]and when you sell you soul for a leading role
[01:02.41]will the lost souls be forgot?
[01:05.28]
[01:06.81]And if I can't hear the music
[01:10.11]and the audience is gone
[01:13.16]I'll dance here on my own
[01:19.16]And I hope the lonely hearts club band
[01:22.75]will play out one last song
[01:25.52]before the sun goes down
[01:30.04]
[01:31.41]And is it envy?
[01:34.43]Should it really make you sick?
[01:37.77]Is another time that you realise
[01:40.94]you'd better get out quick
[01:43.28]Cause time is ticking on
[01:46.91]too long to fake a smile
[01:50.04]But then you sell your soul for a leading role
[01:53.16]so wear it for a while
[01:55.89]
[01:57.58]And if I can't hear the music
[02:00.80]and the audience is gone
[02:03.83]I'll dance here on my own
[02:09.83]And I hope the lonely hearts club band
[02:13.42]will play out one last song
[02:16.18]before the sun goes down
[02:21.02]And there she goes
[02:27.11]And there she goes
[02:30.77]
[02:33.87]So, 'round you'll see me run
[02:40.09]Cause Billy's got himself a gun
[02:46.43]And you're right to be afraid
[02:49.24]They'll send you to your grave
[02:52.48]Cause you're strange and new,
[02:55.36]So, 'round you'll see me run
[03:01.56]Cause Billy's got himself a gun
[03:07.81]And you're right to be afraid
[03:10.69]They'll send you to your grave
[03:13.95]Cause you're strange and new
[03:17.10]
[03:17.61]And if I can't hear the music
[03:21.05]and the audience is gone
[03:24.78]I'll dance
[03:27.11]
