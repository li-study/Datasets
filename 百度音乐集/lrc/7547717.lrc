[00:00.00]The Logical Song
[00:04.29]- Supertramp
[00:07.68]
[00:08.97]When I was young,
[00:10.39]it seemed that life was so wonderful,
[00:13.82]A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.
[00:18.69]And all the birds in the trees,
[00:20.70]well theyd be singing so happily,
[00:24.29]Joyfully, playfully watching me.
[00:31.19]But then they send me away
[00:33.49]to teach me how to be sensible,
[00:36.72]Logical, responsible, practical.
[00:41.82]And they showed me a world
[00:43.57]where I could be so dependable,
[00:46.94]Clinical, intellectual, cynical.
[00:51.44]
[00:53.52]There are times
[00:55.60]when all the worlds asleep,
[00:59.81]The questions run too deep
[01:03.91]For such a simple man.
[01:09.51]Wont you please,
[01:11.56]please tell me what weve learned
[01:15.59]I know it sounds absurd
[01:19.68]But please tell me who I am.
[01:23.84]
[01:29.49]Now watch what you say
[01:31.55]or theyll be calling you a radical,
[01:34.88]Liberal, fanatical, criminal.
[01:39.49]Wont you sign up your name,
[01:41.66]wed like to feel youre acceptable
[01:44.84]Respecable,
[01:47.05]presentable, a vegtable!
[01:51.01](............... Music ..............)
[02:13.50]At night, when all the worlds asleep,
[02:19.57]The questions run so deep
[02:23.48]For such a simple man.
[02:29.13]Wont you please,
[02:31.24]please tell me what weve learned
[02:35.33]I know it sounds absurd
[02:39.39]But please tell me who I am.
[02:44.80]Who I am, who I am, who I am
