[00:04.20]What a Wonderful World
[00:21.70]
[00:27.76]I see trees of green, red roses too
[00:35.05]I see them bloom for me and you
[00:40.73]And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[00:53.71]I see skies of blue and clouds of white
[01:01.48]The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
[01:06.99]And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[01:20.53]The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
[01:27.72]Are also on the faces of people going by
[01:33.06]I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"
[01:40.89]They're really saying "I love you"
[01:46.06]I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
[01:53.75]They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
[01:59.55]And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[02:32.60]The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
[02:39.16]Are also on the faces of people going by
[02:45.51]I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"
[02:52.92]They're really saying "I love you"
[02:58.04]I hear my babies cryin', I watch them grow
[03:06.11]They'll learn much more than I'll ever ever know
[03:11.95]And I think to myself, it's a wonderful world
[03:25.12]I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[03:52.69]What a wonderful world
[04:07.72]And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
[04:20.50]The end
