[00:19.37]Now that we are older,
[00:22.88]Our hearts have all grown up.
[00:29.15]Just a little wiser,
[00:32.45]But are we wise enough?
[00:38.77]Watching imitations of the real thing.
[00:43.59]You and I have both been fooled before.
[00:49.68]
[00:51.26]But this time, we win.
[00:56.33]Our ship has just come in.
[01:01.11]Forget the past.
[01:05.94]We've saved the best for last.
[01:13.51]
[01:14.85]Now that we are younger
[01:18.51]Than we were last night.
[01:24.61]You can be my arrow,
[01:27.95]I'll be your guiding light.
[01:33.92]There isn't any danger we can't handle.
[01:44.29]
[01:46.63]But this time, we win.
[01:51.79]Our ship has just come in.
[01:56.60]Forget the past.
[02:01.40]We've saved the best for last.
[02:06.21]Tonight entwined.
[02:10.95]This love is genuine.
[02:15.84]Forget the past.
[02:20.64]We've saved the best for last.
[02:30.25]
[02:48.75]We've both had enough of hesistation.
[02:58.95]Didn't matter, didn't matter.
[03:09.11]
[03:17.82]But this time, we win.
[03:22.97]Our ship has just come in.
[03:27.86]Forget the past.
[03:32.66]We've saved the best for last.
[03:37.48]Tonight entwined.
[03:42.29]This love is genuine.
[03:47.16]Forget the past.
[03:51.97]We've saved the best for last.
