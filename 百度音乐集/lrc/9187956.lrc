[00:10.45]It's only now when words are said
[00:21.28]That break my heart in two,
[00:30.04]I wonder how you can endure
[00:39.36]All I've said, all I say to you.
[00:51.23]
[00:52.66]How strong, how brave, how true of you
[01:00.75]To bear the hurt I gave.
[01:09.08]I know it tears your heart in two:
[01:18.35]All I've said, all I say to you.
[01:30.22]
[01:31.96]After all the words are said,
[01:40.54]After all the dreams we made;
[01:49.15]Every one a precious one,
[01:57.66]Every one a summer sun...
[02:07.18]
[02:08.55]A moment lost, forever gone,
[02:16.79]Can never be again,
[02:24.99]So know how much it means to me;
[02:34.55]All you said,
[02:39.19]All you gave,
[02:44.50]All your love to me.
