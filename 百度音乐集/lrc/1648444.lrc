[00:02.01]Gotta Have You
[00:04.98]The Weepies
[00:06.01]
[00:15.47]Gray, quiet and tired and mean
[00:20.45]Picking at a worried seam
[00:23.64]I try to make you mad at me over the phone
[00:28.33]Red eyes and fire and signs
[00:33.27]I'm taken by a nursery rhyme
[00:36.42]I want to make a ray of sunshine and never leave home
[00:41.17]No amount of coffee
[00:42.82]No amount of crying
[00:44.49]No amount of whiskey
[00:46.20]No amount of wine
[00:47.71]No.., nothing else will do
[00:52.85]I've gotta have you
[00:54.30]I've gotta have you
[00:56.04]
[01:08.62]The road gets cold
[01:11.02]There's no spring in the middle this year
[01:15.63]I'm the new chicken clucking open hearts and ears
[01:21.84]Oh, such a prima donna
[01:24.57]Sorry for myself
[01:27.72]But green, it is also summer
[01:31.01]And I won't be warm till I'm lying in your arms
[01:37.41]No amount of coffee
[01:38.84]No amount of crying
[01:40.49]No amount of whiskey
[01:42.13]No amount of wine
[01:43.53]No, nothing else will do
[01:48.86]I've gotta have you
[01:50.59]I've gotta have you
[01:52.11]
[02:06.11]I see it all through a telescope:
[02:09.21]Guitar, suitcase, and a warm coat
[02:12.44]Lying in the back of the blue boat
[02:15.87]Humming a tune....
[02:17.12]
[02:31.71]No amount of coffee
[02:33.69]No amount of crying
[02:34.87]No amount of whiskey
[02:36.34]No wine
[02:38.25]No, nothing else will do
[02:43.19]I've gotta have you
[02:44.83]I've gotta have you
[02:46.20]No amount of coffee
[02:47.51]No amount of crying
[02:49.35]No amount of whiskey
[02:50.96]No amount of wine
[02:52.51]No, nothing else will do
[02:57.52]I've gotta have you
[02:59.17]I've gotta have you
[03:02.51]I've gotta have you
[03:06.06]gotta have you
[03:08.84]I've gotta have you
[03:10.39]
