[00:01.18]Speed Of Sound
[00:04.60]Coldplay 
[00:09.27]
[00:19.27]how long before I get in 
[00:22.27]before it starts, before I begin 
[00:26.90]how long before we decide 
[00:30.59]before I know what it feels like 
[00:34.29]where do, where do I go 
[00:37.92]if you never tried then you'll never know 
[00:41.75]how long do I have to climb 
[00:45.81]up on this side of this mountain of mine 
[00:49.40]
[01:06.18]look up, I look up at night 
[01:09.22]planets are moving at the speed of light 
[01:13.19]come up, up in the trees 
[01:16.89]every chance that you get 
[01:18.99]is a chance you seize 
[01:21.05]how long I can stand 
[01:25.17]with my head stuck under the sand 
[01:29.44]I start before I can stop 
[01:32.48]before I say things that I made up 
[01:36.69]
[01:39.16]and all that noise, all that sound 
[01:42.28]all these pieces that i have found 
[01:51.15]and the earth is gone flying at the speed of sound 
[01:57.01]to show how it all began 
[02:00.05]birds come flying from the underground 
[02:04.49]if you could see it then you'd understand 
[02:07.33]
[02:18.38]ideas that you'll never find 
[02:21.30]all the inventors could never design 
[02:25.25]the buildings that you put up 
[02:29.06]Japan and China were all lit up 
[02:33.76]the sign that I couldn't read 
[02:37.40]all the land that I couldn't see 
[02:41.19]some things you have to believe 
[02:44.61]but others are puzzles, puzzling me 
[02:48.11]
[02:51.11]and all that noise, all that sound 
[02:54.84]all those pieces that I have found 
[03:04.31]and the earth is gone flying at the speed of sound 
[03:09.13]to show how it all began 
[03:12.09]birds come flying from the underground 
[03:16.64]if you could see it then you'd understand 
[03:20.20]oh, when you see it then you'll understand 
[03:23.32]
[03:35.96]all those signs I knew what they meant 
[03:39.58]something you can't invent 
[03:42.58]something...something...
[03:47.49]ooh 
[03:50.39]words go flying at the speed of sound 
[03:53.94]to show how it all began 
[03:57.58]birds came flying from the underground 
[04:01.44]if you could see it then you'd understand 
[04:04.96]oh, when you see it then you'll understand 
[04:08.74]
