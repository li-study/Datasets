[00:05.13]In the fights they had he'd cover up his ears
[00:08.93]Thought big boys don't cry, fought back all the tears
[00:13.43]Mama'd use her make up, to hide the bruises on his face
[00:20.51]In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace
[00:28.30]His old man woke him up to help him find the car
[00:32.43]Take the bus uptown outside some rundown bar
[00:37.23]And swore that he was quittin
[00:39.57]And then he'd start to cry
[00:43.93]And though the boy knew the truth
[00:48.62]Sometimes he'd still believe that lie
[00:50.99]
[00:51.24]When the sins of the father are the sins of the son
[00:55.75]All you do is crawl when you wanna run
[00:59.59]And God gave boys their mamas cause
[01:01.71]They always see their promise
[01:03.17]And they help them understand
[01:09.21]How to walk like a man
[01:17.27]Walk like a man

[01:26.64]They moved a lot of places, they never settled down
[01:30.58]It got pretty old being the new kid in town
[01:34.56]He always told his friends, my daddy's sick today
[01:41.50]Said he'd be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his mama say
[01:49.93]The sins of the father are the sins of the son
[01:53.85]Crawl before you walk, boy
[01:57.34]Walk before you run
[01:57.91]Come on, stand up straight, I'm proud of you
[02:01.16]Take my hand
[02:03.91]I know you can
[02:07.82]Walk like a man
[02:15.32]Walk like a man
[02:24.78]Your daddy's demons are callin' your name
[02:31.10]Don't you listen to them cause they've got no claim
[02:38.29]Temptations may come, that ain't no sin
[02:44.94]You get stronger every time that you don't give in
[02:50.32]
[02:51.89]The sins of the father are the sins of the son
[02:55.72]You can't undo what has been done
[02:59.52]You'll have to retrace his footsteps
[03:02.82]Through the sand
[03:07.16]And pray you find the love of a girl
[03:11.18]And take her by the hand
[03:14.98]And walk on
[03:19.86]Walk like a man
