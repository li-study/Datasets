[00:07.53]Title: Time After Time
[00:12.95]
[00:14.95]Lying in my bed
[00:17.65]I hear the clock tick
[00:20.11]And think of you
[00:22.71]Caught up in circles confusion
[00:27.52]Is nothing new
[00:30.14]You say, go slow
[00:34.30]I fall behind
[00:38.15]The second hand unwinds
[00:40.82]If you're lost you can look
[00:42.59]And you will find me
[00:45.66]Time after time
[00:48.30]If you fall I will catch you
[00:50.45]I'll be waiting
[00:53.05]Time after time
[00:56.73]Time after time
[01:00.58]Time after time
[01:02.00]
[01:03.75]Sometimes you picture me
[01:07.13]I'm walking too far ahead
[01:11.16]You're calling to me
[01:14.39]I can't hear just what you've said
[01:18.60]You say go slow
[01:23.04]I fall behind
[01:26.70]The second hand unwinds
[01:29.41]If you're lost you can look
[01:31.24]And you will find me
[01:34.45]Time after time
[01:36.91]If you fall I will catch you
[01:39.17]I'll be waiting
[01:42.09]Time after time
[01:44.50]
[02:00.40]After my picture fades
[02:03.36]And darkness has turned to gray
[02:07.65]Watching through windows
[02:10.72]You're wondering if I'm ok
[02:15.20]You say go slow
[02:19.63]I fall behind
[02:23.00]The drum beats out of time
[02:25.67]
[02:27.75]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[02:32.39]Time after time
[02:35.17]If you fall I will catch you
[02:37.25]I'll be waiting
[02:39.85]Time after time
[02:42.93]If you're lost you can look and you will find me
[02:47.65]Time after time
[02:49.95]If you fall I will catch you
[02:52.26]I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
[02:55.01]Time after time
[02:58.85]Time after time
[03:02.62]Time after time
[03:04.03]
