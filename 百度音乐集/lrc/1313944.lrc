[00:10]Escucha el ritmo de tu corazon
[00:18]From the coast of Ipanema
[00:21]To the Island of Capri
[00:23]All the way to Guadalupe
[00:25]I will follow you wherever you may be
[00:30]From the moment, I first saw you
[00:32]Knew my heart could not be free
[00:35]Have to hold you in my arms
[00:37]There can never be another for me
[00:40]
[00:42]All I need is the rhythm divine
[00:47]Lost in the music
[00:49]Your heart will be mine
[00:51]All I need is to look in your eyes
[00:56]Viva la musica
[00:59]Say you'll be mine
[01:00]
[01:01]When you feel the heat of passion
[01:03]Can you taste on love's sweet wine
[01:05]Join the dance and let it happen
[01:08]Tomorrow skips right out of your mind
[01:12]As the music draws you closer
[01:15]And you're falling down my spine
[01:17]I will catch you in my arms now
[01:20]Where the night can take us no can tell
[01:23]
[01:24]All I need is the rhythm divine
[01:29]Lost in the music
[01:32]Your heart will be mine
[01:34]All I need is the look in your eyes
[01:39]Viva la musica
[01:41]Say you'll be mine
[01:42]
[01:44]Can't have this feeling forever
[01:46]Gonna live this moment together
[01:48]Nothing else matters
[01:50]Just you and the night
[01:53]We're on the wings of desire
[01:56]Another look is taking you higher
[01:58]No one can stop us from having it all
[02:01]
[02:02]You are my heart......you are my soul
[02:07]
[02:28][02:09]All I need is the rhythm divine
[02:33][02:14]Lost in the music
[02:35][02:16]Your heart will be mine
