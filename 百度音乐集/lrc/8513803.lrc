[00:12.00]There\'s something I want to tell you
[00:17.34]There\'s something I think that you should know
[00:22.38]It\'s not that I shouldn\'t really love you
[00:27.04]Let\'s take it slow
[00:34.00]When we get to know each other
[00:38.23]And we\'re both feeling much stronger
[00:44.21]Then let\'s try to talk it over
[00:49.09]Let\'s wait a while longer
[00:56.21]Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
[01:01.94]Let\'s wait a while before we go too far
[01:09.55]
[01:18.00]Remember that special night
[01:23.30]When all of the stars were shining bright
[01:28.77]We made our first endeavor to stay together
[01:39.77]We made our very first promise
[01:45.38]To love, to share, and be real honest
[01:51.55]But on that very first night
[01:55.20]It wasn\'t quite right
[02:00.51]
[02:02.47]Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
[02:08.28]Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
[02:13.55]Let\'s wait a while before we go too far
[02:21.71]
[02:29.47]I didn\'t really know not to let all my feelings show
[02:35.03]To save some for later so our love can be greater
[02:40.69]You said you would (always love me)
[02:46.64]Remember I said the same thing too
[02:51.32]You don\'t have to be frightened with my love
[02:56.12](Because) I\'ll never give up on you
[02:59.77]Let\'s wait a while
[03:03.82]A while before it\'s too late
[03:06.23]You know can\'t rush love, love
[03:14.49]Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
[03:19.83]Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
[03:25.35]Let\'s wait a while before we go too far
[03:36.75]Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
[03:41.52]Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
[03:47.45]Let\'s wait a while
[03:56.83]
