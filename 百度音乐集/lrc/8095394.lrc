[00:25.30]
[02:46.44]Sometimes, for a moment of bliss
[02:53.54]And the passion, we're craving
[02:57.68]There's a message we miss
[03:01.74]Sometimes when the spirits left alone
[03:09.02]We must believe in something
[03:12.92]To find if we've grown
[03:15.78]
[03:19.35]Tragic reflex, shattered calm
[03:22.05]Static progress, senses gone
[03:24.94]Numb awareness, final psalm
[03:29.13]
[03:34.05]Swept away with the tide
[03:40.93]Through the holes in my hands
[03:47.66]Crown of thorns at my side
[03:54.49]Drawing lines in the sand
[03:58.38]
[04:13.42]Sometimes, if you're perfectly still
[04:20.90]You can hear the virgin weeping
[04:24.51]For the savior of your will
[04:28.84]Sometimes, your castles in the air
[04:36.07]And the fantasies you're seeking
[04:40.10]Are the crosses you bear
[04:43.44]
[04:46.58]Sacred conflict, blessed prize
[04:49.22]Weeping crosses, stainless eyes
[04:52.59]Desperate addict, faith disguised
[04:56.83]
[05:01.18]Swept away with the tide
[05:08.08]Through the holes in my hands
[05:14.84]Crown of thorns at my side
[05:21.70]Drawing lines in the sand
[05:25.44]
[07:28.95]We fabricate our demons
[07:32.76]Invite them into our homes
[07:36.70]Have supper with the aliens
[07:40.38]And fight the war alone
[07:44.44]We conjure up our skeletons
[07:48.42]Enlist the den of thieves
[07:52.67]Frightened from our closets
[07:56.44]Then sewn upon our sleeves
[07:59.93]
[08:02.76]In the stream of consciousness
[08:10.99]There is a river crying
[08:18.98]Living comes much easier
[08:26.31]
[08:27.54]Once we admit
[08:32.26]We're dying
[08:35.99]
[10:16.42]Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake
[10:23.70]There's a bitterness we harbor
[10:27.98]And hate for hatred's sake
[10:31.92]Sometime we dig an early grave
[10:39.66]And crucify our instincts
[10:42.98]For the hope we couldn't save
[10:45.95]
[10:47.36]Sometimes a view from sinless eyes
[10:54.64]Centers our perspective
[10:59.01]And pacifies our cries
[11:02.88]Sometimes the anguish we survive
[11:10.09]And the mysteries we nurture
[11:15.00]Are the fabrics of our lives
[11:18.07]
[11:21.65]Swept away with the tide
[11:28.59]Through the holes in my hands
[11:35.39]Crown of thorns at my side
[11:41.99]Drawing lines in the sand
[11:47.55]
