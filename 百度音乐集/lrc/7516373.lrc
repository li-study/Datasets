[00:04.00]
[00:10.54]Oh boy,
[00:15.76]If you ever have to let me down
[00:22.28]In this world,
[00:27.39]My life surely
[00:29.76]Would be upside down
[00:33.71]If you ever find,
[00:36.21]That your peace of mind,
[00:39.91]Is shattered in so many ways
[00:45.00]And I find my feet
[00:48.26]Down on lonely street,
[00:51.71]I’ll be stood there waiting for you
[00:56.01]Boy you got me.
[01:00.82]
[01:07.58]Oh yeah,
[01:12.84]Let me look into your deep brown eyes,
[01:19.04]Let me share,
[01:24.32]Every moment
[01:26.72]Every sweet surprise.
[01:30.70]See that I have grown
[01:33.64]And need mercy shown,
[01:36.41]There’s a window to my heart,
[01:41.91]If I find my feet
[01:45.17]Down on lonely street,
[01:48.18]I’ll be stood there waiting for you,
[01:52.91]Boy, you’ve got me high
[01:58.37]Boy, you’ve got me high
[02:03.57]Boy, you’ve got me high
[02:08.85]But if I find my feet
[02:12.53]Down on lonely street
[02:16.65]I’ll be stood there waiting for you
[02:20.53]Boy you’ve got me.
