[00:13.96]I don't care if there's powder on my nose
[00:18.41]I don't care if my hair-do is in place
[00:22.87]I've lost the very meaning of repose
[00:27.37]I never put a mudpack on my face
[00:32.21]Oh who'd have thought that I walk in a daze now
[00:38.63]I never go to shows at night but just to matinees now
[00:46.04]I see the show, and home I go
[00:55.38]Once I laughed when I heard you saying
[01:03.83]That I'd be playing solitaire
[01:11.53]Uneasy in my easy chair
[01:19.21]It never entered my mind
[01:27.55]Once you told me I was mistaken
[01:34.16]That I'd awaken with the sun
[01:41.78]And order orange juice for one
[01:49.35]It never entered my mind
[01:55.82]You have what I lack myself
[02:02.86]And now I even have to scratch my back myself
[02:16.73]Once you warned me that if you scorned me
[02:24.34]I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
[02:31.51]And wish that you were there again
[02:39.17]To get into my hair again
[02:46.79]It never entered my mind
[03:21.54]Once you warned me that if you scorned me
[03:29.35]I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
[03:36.70]And wish that you were there again
[03:43.63]To get into my hair again
[03:52.17]It never entered my mind
[04:02.68]It never entered my mind
