[00:15.72]Everyday you complain, you say men all the same.
[00:19.06]You give your heart, up to them, but they give you pain.
[00:23.03]Telling me, they’re so mean, it’s the same old story
[00:26.84]I try to tell you, girl what more, but you just ignore me.
[01:33.90][00:30.48]
[01:34.28][00:30.90]You wish they would just listen like me
[01:37.88][00:34.57]You wish they would respect you like me
[01:41.64][00:38.33]But there’s something that you can’t see
