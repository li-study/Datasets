[00:12.00]
[00:14.00]I could hardly believe it
[00:17.00]When I heard the news today
[00:20.00]I had to come and get it straight from you
[00:28.00]They said you were leavin'
[00:31.00]Someone swept you heart away
[00:34.00]From the look upon your face I see it's true
[00:41.00]So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
[00:48.00]Tell me one thing more before I go
[03:24.00][02:13.00][00:54.00]Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
[03:32.00][02:20.00][01:02.00]Now that I've been lovin' you so long
[03:39.00][02:27.00][01:08.00]How am I supposed to live without you
[03:45.00][02:34.00][01:15.00]How am I supposed to carry on
[03:52.00][02:40.00][01:22.00]When all that I've been livin' for is gone
[04:01.00][01:28.00]
[01:33.00]I didn't come here for cryin'
[01:35.00]Didn't come here to breakdown
[01:39.00]It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
[01:47.00]And how can I blame you
[01:49.00]When I built my world around
[01:52.00]The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends
[01:59.00]And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
[02:07.00]Even now it's more than I can take
[02:46.00]
[03:11.00]No I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
[03:18.00]Now that your dream has come true
