[00:00.95]Travis - Big Chair
[00:07.32]
[00:25.80]Well you know that I heart everything about you
[00:34.04]And that's why it's quite hard to get through this alone
[00:42.04]You're the only one I can talk to about it
[00:50.05]In my darkest night I will be on my own
[00:59.77]These walls that we climb are hard to recognize
[01:08.26]They fall when I say your name
[01:16.17]Here we go
[01:18.32]Fast and slow
[01:20.17]On the big chair
[01:21.77]
[01:24.46]But we don't know
[01:26.91]Where we're going
[01:28.67]On the big chair
[01:30.90]
[01:32.96]Don't you know it's hard, quite, in a time of confusion
[01:41.70]To tell you that I love you
[01:48.94]
[01:50.50]You see it could have been me instead of you
[01:55.27]It could have been me if I wanted to
[01:59.08]But it wasn't
[02:01.11]So we'll have to face the truth
[02:05.20]
[02:07.74]These walls that we climb are hard to recognize
[02:16.14]They fall when I say your name
[02:24.02]Here we go
[02:26.07]Fast and slow
[02:28.15]On the big chair
[02:30.09]
[02:32.42]But we don't know
[02:34.59]Where we're going
[02:36.48]On the big chair
[02:38.51]
[02:42.21]Time to pull the shutters down
[02:50.77]Breaking clouds don't make a sound
[02:58.61]When they cry
[03:05.56]
[03:15.11]Here we go
[03:17.09]Fast and slow
[03:19.01]On the big chair
[03:21.07]
[03:23.40]But we don't know
[03:25.73]Where we're going
[03:27.54]On the big chair
[03:50.07]
[03:57.51]End~~
