[00:04.92]Maybellene, why can't you be true
[00:08.57]Oh Maybellene , why can't you be true
[00:13.51]You've started back doin' the things you used to do
[00:17.62]As I was motivatin' over the hill
[00:19.45]I saw Mabellene in a Coup de Ville
[00:21.67]A Cadillac arollin' on the open road
[00:23.56]Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
[00:25.73]The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
[00:27.88]She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side
[00:29.45]Maybellene, why can't you be true
[00:32.82]Oh Maybellene , why can't you be true
[00:37.51]You've started back doin' the things you used to do
[00:42.12]The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
[00:43.80]The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
[00:45.89]It then got cloudy and started to rain
[00:47.91]I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
[00:49.96]The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
[00:51.92]I know that I was doin' my motor good
[00:53.96]Maybellene, why can't you be true
[00:57.41]Oh Maybellene , why can't you be true
[01:01.94]You've started back doin' the things you used to do
[01:29.63]Maybellene, why can't you be true
[01:33.70]Oh Maybellene , why can't you be true
[01:38.43]You've started back doin' the things you used to do
[01:43.34]The motor cooled down the heat went down
[01:44.92]And that's when I heard that highway sound
[01:47.01]The Cadillac asittin' like a ton of lead
[01:49.76]A hundred and ten half a mile aheadv The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
[01:53.09]And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill
[01:54.99]Maybellene, why can't you be true
[01:59.66]Oh Maybellene , why can't you be true
[02:03.22]You've started back doin' the things you used to do
