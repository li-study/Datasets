[00:03.00]Artist: Billy Joel
[00:09.06]She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes,
[00:14.70]She can ruin your faith with her casual lies,
[00:19.84]And she only reveals what she wants you to see.
[00:25.19]She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me.
[00:32.70]She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you,
[00:37.53]She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you,
[00:43.35]And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free,
[00:47.88]Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me.
[00:56.84]Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants,
[01:07.77]She's ahead of her time.
[01:13.59]Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in,
[01:23.56]She just changes her mind.
[01:28.38]And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
[01:33.44]then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding,
[01:38.50]But she brings out the best and the worst you can be.
[01:43.44]Blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me.
[01:50.26]......
[02:04.46]Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants,
[02:14.98]She's ahead of her time.
[02:21.22]Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in,
[02:32.32]She just changes her mind.
[02:35.58]She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel,
[02:40.50]She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool,
[02:45.67]But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree,
[02:50.81]And the most she will do is throw shadows at you
[02:55.86]But she's always a woman to me.
[03:01.07]......
