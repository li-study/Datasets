[00:01.08]Stand By Me
[00:03.27]John Lennon
[00:06.13]
[00:18.66]When the night has come
[00:23.36]And the land is dark
[00:28.17]And the moon is the only light we'll see
[00:36.91]No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
[00:44.95]
[00:46.45]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[00:53.68]And darlin', darlin', stand by me, 
[00:59.40]oh now now stand by me
[01:03.85]Stand by me, stand by me
[01:11.76]If the sky that we look upon
[01:17.88]Should tumble and fall
[01:23.20]And the mountains should crumble to the sea
[01:28.69]
[01:31.88]I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
[01:40.90]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[01:48.25]And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
[01:59.28]Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah
[02:08.25]
[02:43.51]Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, 
[02:48.52]oh now now stand by me
[02:53.07]Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
[03:01.63]Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
[03:12.10]Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
[03:18.68]
