[00:14.95]la...la ...
[00:45.47]A ray of hope
[00:48.36]flickers in the sky,
[00:53.30]a tiny star
[00:56.40]lights up way up high.
[01:01.98]All across the land,
[01:04.28]dawns a brand new morn.
[01:08.45]This comes to pass,
[01:12.17]when a child is born.
[01:16.95]A silent wish
[01:19.90]sails the seven seas,
[01:24.56]the wind of change
[01:27.67]whisper in the trees.
[01:32.99]And the walls of doubt,
[01:35.12]crumble tost and torn.
[01:39.00]This comes to pass,
[01:42.88]when a child is born.
[01:47.37]A rosy hue settles all around,
[01:54.77]You got the feel
[01:57.97]You’re on solid ground,
[02:03.47]For a spell of two no one seems forlorn
[02:09.70]This comes to pass,
[02:13.60]when a child is born.
[02:20.77]（And all of this happens
[02:22.91]because the world is waiting,
[02:24.99]waiting for one child.
[02:27.83]Black, white, yellow,
[02:30.45]no one knows,
[02:32.47]but a child that will grow up.
[02:34.75]And turns tears to laughter,
[02:36.98]hates to love, war to peace.
[02:40.18]And everyone to everyone's neighbour and misery
[02:45.47]and suffering,will be words to be forgotten forever.
[02:50.47]It's all a dream,
[02:53.56]an illusion now,
[02:57.98]it must come true
[03:01.35]sometime soon, sometime how.
[03:06.35]All across the land,
[03:09.33]dawns a brand new morn.
[03:13.10]This comes to pass,
[03:17.01]when a child is born.
