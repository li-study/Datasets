[00:17.89]First time I saw my son, I knew I was in love
[00:25.85]Because he was the gift I got from somewhere up above
[00:34.50]O wow, o yes, o joy, so joy right here in my arms
[00:42.86]He looks at me, I can see he's showing all his charms
[00:52.01]Can't remember what I did before I saw his face
[01:00.69]But now he's here and I can feel his amazing grace
[01:08.55]
[01:08.90]Watching him play somehow, reminds me of myself
[01:17.48]Once upon a different time when I was someone else
[01:25.90]O me o my I feel so high every single day
[01:34.35]O yes o lay my lord yea yea watching my son play
[01:42.88]First time he walk detours I step into a chance
[01:52.13]I took his hand and then we start it like dance
[02:00.16]The first dance was so fine that I never will forget
[02:08.59]He held my hand so tightly that my hand start dancing yet
[02:16.85]
[02:17.33]My love, my boy, my son, my joy always keep you glow
[02:25.75]and now that love will be with you wherever you may go
[02:34.29]And if something should fall apart somewhere down the line
[02:43.05]Just tell me all about it and I will make it fine
[02:51.40]
[02:51.61]I travelled many roads before but somehow they were wrong
[03:00.07]And sometime we find that life is just a simple song
[03:08.74]Even the saddest songs ever human face
[03:17.37]I will always keep my son in love's magic place
