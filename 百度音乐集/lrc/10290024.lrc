[00:19.00]Baby you're so beautiful
[00:23.00]And when I'm near you I can't breathe
[00:29.00]A girl like you gets who she wants
[00:32.00]When she wants it
[00:34.00]You're so out of my league
[00:39.00]I show you no emotion
[00:42.00]Don't let you see what you're don't to me
[00:48.00]I imagine the two of us together
[00:52.00]But I've been livin' in reality
[02:10.00][00:57.00]Fear of rejection, kept my love inside
[01:02.00]But time is running out, so damn my foolish pride
[03:18.00][02:19.00][01:06.00]I don't care if you think I'm crazy
[03:24.00][02:23.00][01:10.00]It dosen't matter if it tums out bad
[03:27.00][02:29.00][01:15.00]I've got no fear of losing' you
[01:43.00][04:06.00][03:57.00][03:53.00][03:29.00][02:32.00][01:19.00]You can't lose what you never had
[01:51.00]Rules are made for breaking
[01:55.00]Nothin ventured nothin gained
[02:00.00]I'll be no worse off then I am right now
[02:05.00]And I might never get the chance again
[02:15.00]Told my heart I didn't want you but I lied
[01:25.00][03:35.00][02:38.00]Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
[01:28.00][03:39.00][02:41.00]I've been keeping it inside feeling I could die
[01:34.00][03:43.00][02:47.00]Now if you turn away then that's O.K
[01:39.00][03:48.00][02:52.00]At least we'll have a moment before
[01:42.00][03:51.00][02:55.00]You say good-bye
[02:58.00]Here on the outside looking in
[03:02.00]Don't wanna stay dreaming about
[03:06.00]What could have been
[03:08.00]I need to hear you speak my name
[03:12.00]Even if you shoot me down in flames
[00:11.00][04:11.00][04:01.00]Ah~~~ Ah~~~ Ah~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
