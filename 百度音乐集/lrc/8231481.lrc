[ti:These Foolish Things]

[00:21.50]A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
[00:28.50]An airline ticket to romantic places
[00:36.50]Still my heart has wings
[00:41.50]These foolish things remind me of you.
[00:50.50]A tinkling piano in the next apartment
[00:58.50]Those stumblin'words
[01:02.50]That told you what my heart meant
[01:06.50]A fair ground painted swings
[01:12.50]These foolish things remind me of you.
[01:21.50]You came, you saw, you conquered me
[01:36.50]When you did that to me
[01:43.50]I knew somehow this had to be
[01:51.50]Win the marks
[01:53.50]And make my heart a dancer
[01:59.50]A telephone that rings
[02:02.50]But who's to answer
[02:07.50]Oh, how the ghost of you clings
[02:12.50]These foolish things remind me of you
