[00:31.69]a night of destiny
[00:38.15]others are sleeping
[00:41.16]so unware of magic in the air

[00:57.33]sweet fascination
[00:59.81]through i don't understand
[01:01.86]the words you say
[01:04.25]you whisper soft and low
[01:07.07]and i am swept away
[01:13.46]touch of enchantment
[01:16.47]i tremble when you
[01:17.66]hold me close this way
[01:20.95]drawn like a moth to flame
[01:26.38]lo so mo pri gi o ni e ra
