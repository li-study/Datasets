[00:06.56]Under The Iron Sea
[00:09.59]12th June, 2006
[00:12.00]
[00:19.35]Who is the man I see
[00:26.84]Where I'm supposed to be
[00:34.18]I lost my heart
[00:37.35]I buried it too deep
[00:42.21]Under the iron sea
[00:49.87]
[00:50.08]Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
[00:56.00]Tell me life is beautiful
[00:57.92]Mirror, mirror on the wall
[01:03.83]
[01:05.51]Lines ever more unclear
[01:13.19]Not sure I'm even here
[01:20.33]The more I look the more I think that I'm
[01:28.71]Starting to disappear
[01:35.85]
[01:36.33]Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
[01:41.57]Tell me life is beautiful
[01:43.52]Mirror, mirror on the wall
[01:51.12]Oh crystal ball hear my song
[01:55.91]I'm fading out
[01:57.21]Everything I know is wrong
[01:58.77]So put me where I belong
[02:06.15]
[02:06.81]I don't know where I am
[02:10.39]And I don't really care
[02:14.23]I look myself in the eye
[02:17.24]There's no one there
[02:22.05]I fall upon the earth
[02:25.72]I call upon the air
[02:29.73]But all I get is the same old vacant stare
[02:38.27]
[02:38.43]Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
[02:44.14]Tell me life is beautiful
[02:46.07]Mirror, mirror on the wall
[02:53.61]Oh crystal ball hear my song
[02:58.43]I'm fading out
[02:59.56]Everything I know is wrong
[03:01.49]So put me where I belong
[03:07.80]
