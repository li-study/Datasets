[00:02]I Will Remember You
[00:04]
[00:05]I will remember you
[00:12]Will you remember me?
[00:18]Don't let your life pass you by
[00:28]Weep not for the memories
[00:35]
[00:36]Remember the good times that we had?
[00:43]I let them slip away from us when things got bad
[00:50]How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
[00:56]Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one
[01:02]
[01:03]I will remember you
[01:10]Will you remember me?
[01:17]Don't let your life pass you by
[01:26]Weep not for the memories
[01:33]
[01:34]I'm so tired but I can't sleep
[01:41]Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
[01:48]It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
[01:54]We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard
[02:01]
[02:02]But I will remember you
[02:08]Will you remember me?
[02:15]Don't let your life pass you by
[02:24]Weep not for the memories
[02:32]
[03:00]I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to loose
[03:06]Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
[03:13]Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
[03:20]You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light
[03:26]
[03:27]And I will remember you
[03:34]Will you remember me?
[03:41]Don't let your life pass you by
[03:50]Weep not for the memories
[03:57]
[03:58]And I will remember you
[04:05]Will you remember me?
[04:11]Don't let your life pass you by
[04:20]Weep not for the memories
[04:32]Weep not for the memories
[04:42]
