[00:00.52]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[00:05.11]Singing my life with his words,

[00:48.46]I heard he sang a good song,
[00:52.40]I heard he had a style,
[00:56.44]And so I came to see him and listen for a while.

[01:44.48]Embarrassed by the crowd,
[01:48.29]I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
[01:56.03]I prayed that he would finish,
[01:59.90]But he just kept right on

[02:35.98]In all my dark despair
[02:39.86]And then he looked right through me ,
[02:43.07]As if l wasn't there
[02:47.26]And he just keep on saying ,
