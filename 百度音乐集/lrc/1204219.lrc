[00:05.00]Is this just fantasy
[00:09.00]Caught in a landslide
[00:12.00]No escape from reality
[00:16.00]Open your eyes
[00:19.00]Look up to the skies and see
[00:26.00]I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
[00:33.00]Because I'm easy come, easy go
[00:37.00]A little high, little low

[01:17.00]But now I've gone and thrown it all away
[01:24.00]Mama, ooo,
[01:31.00]Didn't mean to make you cry
[01:34.00]If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

[02:03.00]Sends shivers down my spine
[02:06.00]Body's aching all the time
[02:10.00]Goodbye everybody I've got to go
[02:16.00]Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
[02:23.00]Mama, ooo

[04:05.00]for me
[04:17.00]So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
[04:23.00]So you think you can love me and leave me to die
