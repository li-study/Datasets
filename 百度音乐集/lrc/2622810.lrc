[00:26.47]Today I watched in silence as people passed me by,
[00:31.82]And I strained to see if there was something hidden in their eyes;
[00:37.48]But they all looked at me as if to say
[00:42.29]Life just goes on.
[00:45.12]
[00:49.53]The old familiar story told in different ways,
[00:55.18]Make the most of your own journey from the cradle to the grave;
[01:01.13]Dream your dreams tomorrow because today
[01:05.60]Life must go on.
[02:29.33][01:08.69]
[02:33.43][01:12.27]But there's more to this life than living and dying,
[04:00.06][03:40.17][02:41.48][01:20.05]More than just trying to make it through the day;
[04:04.46][03:45.10][02:46.26][01:24.83]More to this life, more than these eyes alone can see,
[02:54.09][01:32.77]And there's more than this life alone can be.
[01:38.19]
[01:47.59]Tonight he lies in silence staring into space,
[01:53.33]And looks for ways to make tomorrow better than today,
[01:59.19]But in the morning light it looks the same;
[02:03.95]Life just goes on.
[02:05.89]
[02:10.98]He takes care of his family, he takes care of his work,
[02:16.67]And every Sunday morning he takes his place at the church;
[02:22.48]And somehow he still feels a need to search,
[02:26.85]But life just goes on.
[02:58.33]
[03:03.13]So where do we start to find every part
[03:08.81]Of what makes this life complete;
[03:14.51]If we turn our eyes to Jesus we'll find
[03:20.37]that Life's true beginning is there at the cross where He died.
[03:29.12]He died to bring us more to this life than living and dying,
[03:52.05]And there's more, more to this life than living and dying,
[04:12.40]And there's more, so much more than this life alone can be.
