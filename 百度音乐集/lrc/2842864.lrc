[00:01.30]Fooled Around And Fell In Love

[00:13.21]
[00:14.00]I must have been through about a million girls
[00:19.88]I\'d love \'em then I\'d leave \'em alone
[00:26.14]I didn\'t care how much they cried, no sir
[00:32.59]Their tears left me cold as a stone
[00:37.70]
[00:38.59]But then I fooled around and fell in love
[00:44.94]I fooled around and fell in love
[00:51.59]I fooled around and fell in love
[00:57.83]I fooled around and fell in love
[01:03.19]
[01:04.35]It used to be when I\'d see a girl that I liked
[01:10.29]I\'d get out my book and write down her name
[01:16.73]But when the grass got a little greener over on the other side
[01:23.53]I\'d just tear out that page
[01:28.21]
[01:29.44]But then I fooled around and fell in love
[01:35.99]I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
[01:42.57]I fooled around and fell in love
[01:48.94]I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
[01:55.87]
[02:34.52]Free, on my own is the way I used to be
[02:40.58]But since I met you baby, love\'s got a hold on me
[02:46.11]
[02:46.86]I fooled around and fell in love
[02:52.94]I fooled around and fell in love
[02:59.10]I fooled around and fell in love
[03:05.17]I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
[03:11.62]I fooled around and fell in love
[03:18.15]I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
[03:24.51]I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, I fell in love
[03:39.82]End
