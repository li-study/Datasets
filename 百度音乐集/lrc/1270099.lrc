[00:01.00]The whispers in the morning
[00:07.66]Of lovers sleeping tight
[00:14.71]Are rolling like thunder now
[00:21.37]As I look in your eyes
[00:25.91]
[00:28.31]I hold on to your body
[00:34.94]And feel each move you make
[00:41.91]Your voice is warm and tender
[00:46.14]A love that I could not forsake
[00:53.57]
[00:55.55]Cause I am your lady
[01:02.46]And you are my man
[01:09.13]Whenever you reach for me
[01:16.00]I'll do all that I can
[01:20.96]
[01:23.28]Lost is how I'm feeling
[01:30.06]Lying in your arms
[01:37.08]When the world outside's too much to take
[01:43.48]That all ends when I'm with you
[01:48.32]
[01:50.34]Even though there may be times
[01:57.01]It seems I'm far away
[02:04.25]Never wonder where I am
[02:08.57]Cause I am always by your side
[02:16.68]
[02:17.77]Cause I am your lady
[02:24.61]And you are my man
[02:31.49]Whenever you reach for me
[02:38.25]I'll do all that I can
[02:43.70]
[02:45.06]We're heading for something
[02:51.30]Somewhere I've never been
[02:58.66]Sometimes I am frightened
[03:01.54]But I'm ready to learn
[03:05.69]Of the power of love
[03:10.80]
[03:15.99]The sound of your heart beating
[03:22.61]Made it clear suddenly
[03:29.62]The feeling that I can't go on
[03:36.59]Is light years away
[03:43.52]Cause I am your lady
[03:50.21]And you are my man
[03:57.22]Whenever you reach for me
[04:03.35]I'll do all that I can
[04:10.78]We're heading for something
[04:17.46]Somewhere I've never been
[04:24.32]Sometimes I am frightened
[04:27.29]But I'm ready to learn
[04:31.44]Of the power of love
[04:35.51]
[04:38.27]The power of love
[04:44.91]The power of love
[04:51.81]Sometimes I am frightened
[04:54.80]But I'm ready to learn
[04:58.65]Of the power of love
[05:07.27]
[05:12.37]The power of love
[05:17.56]
