[00:00.03]Dido - Look No Further
[00:06.00]
[00:08.06]I might have been a singer
[00:11.77]Who sailed around the world
[00:15.53]A gambler who wins millions
[00:19.25]And spent it all on girls
[00:22.08]
[00:23.13]I might have been a poet
[00:25.77]Who walked upon the moon
[00:30.40]A scientist who wouldtell the world
[00:33.43]I discovered something new
[00:35.68]
[00:38.05]I might have loved a king
[00:41.37]Been the one to end a war
[00:45.38]A criminal who drink champaign
[00:49.06]And never could be caught
[00:51.91]
[00:53.03]But among your books
[00:55.87]Among your clothes
[01:00.49]Among the noise and fuss
[01:02.71]
[01:03.31]I've let it go
[01:05.41]
[01:07.35]I can't stop and catch my breathe
[01:14.66]And Look No further for happiness
[01:21.76]And I will not turn again
[01:29.68]'Cause my heart has found its home
[01:35.36]
[01:38.19]Everyone i'll never meet
[01:41.72]And friends I wont now make
[01:45.37]The adventures that they could have been
[01:48.92]And the risks I'll never take
[01:51.36]
[01:52.94]but Among Your Books
[01:55.65]Among your clothes
[02:00.68]Among the noise and fuss
[02:02.87]
[02:03.37]I've let it go
[02:05.28]
[02:07.33]I can't stop and catch my breathe
[02:14.62]And Look No further for happiness
[02:21.64]And I will not turn again
[02:29.80]'Cause my heart has found its home
[02:37.21]
