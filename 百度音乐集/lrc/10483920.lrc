[00:01.00]Evening Falls
[00:03.00]Enya
[00:04.00]
[00:05.00]When the evening falls and the daylight is fading,
[00:16.00]from within me calls - could it be I am sleeping?
[00:27.00]For a moment I stray, then it holds me completely.
[00:38.00]close to home - I cannot say.
[00:46.00]close to home feeling so far away.
[00:56.86]
[00:59.00]As I walk the room there before me a shadow
[01:10.00]from another world, where no other can follow.
[01:20.50]carry me to my own, to where I can cross over...
[01:31.50]close to home - I cannot say.
[01:39.50]close to home feeling so far away.
[01:52.00]Forever searching; never right,
[02:01.00]I am lost in oceans of night.
[02:08.50]Forever hoping I can find memories.
[02:16.50]those memories I left behind.
[02:28.12]
[02:45.50]Even though I leave will I go on believing
[02:55.50]that this time is real - am I lost in this feeling?
[03:05.50]like a child passing through, never knowing the reason.
[03:16.50]I am home - I know the way.
[03:24.50]I am home - feeling oh, so far away.
