[00:02.21]I'm Gonna Find Another You
[00:02.62]John Mayer
[00:04.16]
[00:04.47]It's been your word, you made your stand
[00:13.59]You got me crying, as well as you planned
[00:23.36]But when my loneliness is through, I'm gonna find another you
[00:36.67]
[00:41.08]You take your sweaters
[00:46.16]You take your time
[00:50.45]You might have your reasons but you will never have my rhymes
[01:00.78]I'm gonna sing my way away from blue
[01:08.07]I'm gonna find another you
[01:12.66]
[01:20.38]When I was your lover
[01:25.02]No one else would do
[01:29.56]If I'm false to find another I hope she looks like you
[01:38.66]Yeah and she's nicer too
[01:43.18]So go on baby
[01:48.22]Make your little get away
[01:52.45]My pride will keep me company
[01:57.70]And you just gave yours all away
[02:04.32]Now I'm gonna dress myself for two
[02:09.02]Once for me and once for someone new
[02:12.61]I'm gonna do somethings you wouldn't let me do
[02:17.28]Oh I'm gonna find another you
