[00:00.00]Elvis Presley - Way Down
[00:08.09]
[00:10.09]Babe, you're getting closer
[00:13.02]The lights are goin' dim
[00:16.23]The sound of your breathin'
[00:19.43]Has made the mood I'm in
[00:22.82]All of my resistance
[00:26.06]Is lying on the floor
[00:29.18]Taking me to places
[00:32.49]I've never been before
[00:35.14]
[01:31.33][00:36.23]Ooh, and I can feel it,
[01:33.52][00:38.86]Feel it, feel it, feel it
[01:37.77][00:43.25]
[01:38.80][00:44.22]Way down where the music plays
[01:42.03][00:47.31]Way down like a tidal wave
[01:44.98][00:50.42]Way down where the fires blaze
[01:47.73][00:53.08]Way down, down, way, way on down
[01:55.45][01:00.67]
[01:04.97]Ooh, my head is spinnin'
[01:07.69]You got me in your spell,
[01:10.91]A hundred magic fingers
[01:14.16]On a whirling carousel
[01:17.57]The medicine within me
[01:20.74]No doctor could prescribe
[01:23.87]Your love is doing something
[01:27.13]That I just can't describe
[01:29.90]
[02:02.50]Hold me again,
[02:03.81]Tight as you can
[02:05.54]I need you so,
[02:06.73]Baby, let's go
[02:08.52]
[02:09.31]Way down where it feels so good
[02:12.27]Way down where I hoped it would
[02:15.35]Way down where I never could
[02:17.80]Way down, down, way, way on down
[02:26.06]
