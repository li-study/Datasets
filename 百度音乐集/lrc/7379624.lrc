[00:00.62]"Invisible"
[00:21.75]Like a grain on the beach
[00:24.49]Like a star in the sky
[00:27.27]Far too many to count
[00:30.57]With the naked eye
[00:36.29]They will see you
[00:38.59]Go ahead walk on by

[01:12.51]When I was invisible
[01:18.85]Little things adding up
[01:21.44]Try so hard not to rush
[01:24.18]Giving in, letting go

[01:35.62]Force it down, lose the taste

[01:41.35]We don't need to believe
[01:44.68]Every word they say now (say now)
[01:50.95]They don't know me

[02:09.57]When I was invisible
[02:14.64]It's so easy
[02:18.61]To be lost
[02:21.56]But maybe
[02:24.35]You're not lost at all
[02:30.18]Whoa Whoa
[02:33.07]Do you recognize me?
[02:35.45]Whoa Whoa
[02:38.75]Do you know who I am?
