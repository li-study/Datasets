[00:19.10]Gonna blame it on the moon,
[00:25.47]Didn't want to fall in love again so soon.
[00:40.03]I was fine, feeling strong,
[00:46.44]Didn't want to fall in love with anyone.
[00:54.87]
[01:00.24]Now that it's gone too far to call for a halt,
[01:05.92]I'll blame it on the moon
[01:08.56]'Cause it's not my fault;
[01:12.25]I didn't think that this would happen so soon
[01:19.02]So I'll blame it on the moon.
[01:23.70]
[01:31.13]I was happy to be free
[01:37.44]Didn't think I'd give myself so easily.
[01:52.08]Guilty feelings in the night
[01:58.44]As I wonder is it wrong to feel so right.

[02:24.30]I didn't think that this would happen so soon
[02:31.06]So I'll blame it on the moon.
