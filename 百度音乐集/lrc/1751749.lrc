[00:00.19]How gentle is the rain
[00:06.06]that falls softly on the meadow
[00:15.80]Birds high up on the trees
[00:21.70]serenade the clouds with their melodies
[00:28.59]Oh
[00:30.64]How gentle is the rain
[00:35.24]that falls softly on the meadow
[00:40.61]Birds high up on the trees
[00:44.49]serenade the clouds with their melodies
[00:49.19]Oh
[00:50.29]See there beyond the hill
[00:54.78]the bright colors of the rainbow
[00:59.91]some magic from above
[01:03.54]Made this day for us
[01:05.97]just to fall in love
[01:09.55]You'll hold me in your arms
[01:13.79]and say once again you'll love me
[01:18.95]And that your love is true
[01:22.75]everything will be just as wonderful
[01:28.24]
[01:37.58]Now
[01:39.19]I belong to you
[01:42.12]from this day until forever
[01:47.25]Just love me tenderly
[01:50.88]and I'll give to you every part of me
[01:55.66]Oh
[01:56.97]Don't ever make me cry
[02:01.00]through long lonely nights without us
[02:06.41]Be always true to me
[02:09.83]Keep this day in your heart eternally
[02:15.69]You hoid me in your arms
[02:19.91]and say once again you love me
[02:25.28]And that your love is true
[02:28.85]everything will be just as wonderful
[02:34.57]
