[00:01.58]
[00:07.59]BY Larry Cheng & Kevin Boul
[00:10.78]
[00:11.44]Opening a door, packing stuff.,
[00:15.94]
[00:17.88]I waited for so long
[00:21.86]Outside myself
[00:24.44]You see I was pretenting
[00:26.88]To be someone else
[00:30.32]I was longing to see
[00:33.23]Who i wanted to be
[00:36.53]
[00:39.91]And I've been waiting on my own
[00:42.79]I've been waiting for too long
[00:45.80]Not strong enough to be with you
[00:51.53]And I've been making up my world
[00:54.80]I've been painting it with gold
[00:57.85]Not strong enough to see you
[01:03.73]
[01:17.47]I irrigate illusions
[01:21.24]Then let them grow
[01:23.75]How can I pacify myself?
[01:26.93]And let go
[01:29.73]And I run wild to see
[01:32.91]Who I turned out to be
[01:36.36]
[01:40.15]I've been waiting on my own
[01:42.82]I've been waiting for too long
[01:45.89]Not strong enough to be with you
[01:51.65]And I've been making up my world
[01:54.72]I've been painting it with gold
[01:57.79]Not strong enough to see you
[02:02.42]
[02:03.47]I've been waiting on my own
[02:06.61]I've been waiting for too long
[02:09.66]Not strong enough to be with you
[02:15.41]And I've been making up my world
[02:18.57]I've been painting it with gold
[02:22.01]Not strong enough to see you
[02:27.42]
[02:27.99]I've been waiting on my own
[02:32.17]
[02:53.87]OMG! French!! I don't speak French!
[03:50.42]
[03:54.42]I've been waiting on my own
[03:57.65]I've been waiting for too long
[04:01.05]Not strong enough to be with you
[04:06.37]And I've been making up my world
[04:09.65]I've been painting it with gold
[04:13.03]Not strong enough to see you
[04:18.89]See you...(I can hear bing bing sounds!)
