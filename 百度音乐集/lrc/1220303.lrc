[01:50][00:07]No I can't forget this evening and your face
[01:55][00:13]When you were leaving
[01:58][00:15]But I guess that's just the way the story goes
[02:00][00:21]You always smile
[02:04][00:24]But in your eyes your sorrow shows, yes, it shows
[00:37]No, I can't forget tomorrow
[00:40]When I think about my sorrow
[00:45]I had you there, then I let you go
[00:54]And now it only fair that I should let you know
[00:58]What you should know
[04:04][03:24][02:21][01:07]I can't live if living is without you
[04:11][03:27][02:25][01:14]I can't give I can't give anymore
[03:39][03:34][02:33][01:22]I can't live if living is without you
[03:41][02:39][01:29]I can't give I can't give anymore
