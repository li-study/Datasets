[00:-0.50]Evanescence - Like You

[00:14.30]
[00:18.30]Stay low
[00:22.95]Soft, dark, and dreamless
[00:28.80]Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
[00:37.05]I hate me
[00:41.30]For breathing without you
[00:47.43]I don\'t want to feel anymore for you
[00:56.87]
[00:57.84]Grieving for you
[01:01.28]I\'m not grieving for you
[01:05.86]Nothing real love can\'t undo
[01:11.16]And though I may have lost my way
[01:15.75]All paths lead straight to you
[01:20.18]
[01:20.53]I long to be like you
[01:25.13]Lie cold in the ground like you
[01:33.12]
[01:42.19]Halo
[01:46.85]Blinding wall between us
[01:52.67]Melt away and leave us alone again
[02:00.70]Humming, haunted somewhere out there
[02:11.37]I believe our love can see us through in death
[02:20.87]I long to be like you
[02:25.75]Lie cold in the ground like you
[02:30.34]There\'s room inside for two
[02:34.35]and I\'m not grieving for you
[02:39.90]I\'m coming for you
[02:43.86]
[02:51.04]You\'re not alone
[02:56.60]No matter what they told you you\'re not alone
[03:06.17]I\'ll be right beside you forevermore
[03:19.69]I long to be like you, sis
[03:23.95]Lie cold in the ground like you did
[03:28.58]There\'s room inside for two
[03:32.54]and I\'m not grieving for you
[03:37.98]And as we lay in silent bliss
[03:42.60]I know you remember me
[03:47.23]I long to be like you
[03:51.89]Lie cold in the ground like you
[03:56.52]There\'s room inside for two
[04:00.49]and I\'m not grieving for you
[04:06.21]I\'m coming for you
[04:10.56]
