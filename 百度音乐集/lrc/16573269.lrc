[00:17.17]Oh, it's carnival night
[00:19.48]And they're stringing the lights around you
[00:26.61]Hanging paper angels
[00:27.15]Painting little devils on the roof
[00:35.46]Oh the furnace wind
[00:37.97]Is a flickering of wings about your face
[00:44.43]In a cloud of incense
[00:46.71]Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place
[00:52.68]I can't eat, can't sleep
[00:56.96]Still I hunger for you when you look at me
[01:01.99]That face, those eyes
[01:06.82]All the sinful pleasures deep inside
[01:11.10]Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
[01:18.83]Underneath my skin,
[01:23.05]Oh you were always my original sin
[01:29.28]And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
[01:37.12]This dangerous game
[01:41.49]Oh you were always my original sin
[02:01.66]A dream will fly
[02:04.23]The moment that you open up your eyes
[02:10.42]A dream is just a riddle
[02:13.60]Ghosts from every corner of your life
[02:20.23]Up in the balcony
[02:22.60]All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
[02:28.29]Blowing theater kisses
[02:31.53]Reciting lines they don't understand
[02:37.16]I can't eat, can't sleep
[02:42.06]Still I hunger for you when you look at me
[02:47.64]That face, those eyes
[02:52.31]All the sinful pleasures deep inside
[02:55.30]Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
[03:04.02]Underneath my skin,
[03:08.30]Oh you were always my original sin
[03:14.43]And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
[03:23.83]This dangerous game
[03:26.41]Oh you were always my original sin
[03:33.72]Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
[03:42.17]Underneath my skin,
[03:44.73]Oh you were always my original sin
[03:51.00]And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
[03:59.93]This dangerous game
[04:03.22]Oh you were always my original sin
