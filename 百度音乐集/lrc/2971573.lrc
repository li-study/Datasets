[00:05.00]I sit and wait
[00:08.00]Does an angel contemplate my fate
[00:18.00]And do they know
[00:20.00]The places where we go
[00:23.00]When we're grey and old
[00:30.00]'cos I've been told
[00:34.00]That salvation lets their wings unfold
[00:43.00]So when I'm lying in my bed
[00:47.00]Thoughts running through my head
[00:51.00]And I feel that love is dead
[00:55.00]I'm loving angels instead
[03:39.00][02:16.00][00:59.00]And through it all she offers me protection
[03:45.00][02:22.00][01:05.00]A lot of love and affection
[03:48.00][02:25.00][01:08.00]Whether I'm right or wrong
[03:52.00][02:28.00][01:12.00]And down the waterfall
[03:55.00][02:32.00][01:15.00]Wherever it may take me
[03:58.00][02:35.00][01:18.00]I know that life won't break me
[04:01.00][02:38.00][01:21.00]When I come to call she won't forsake me
[04:10.00][02:47.00][01:30.00]I'm loving angels instead
[01:36.00]When I'm feeling weak
[01:38.00]And my pain walks down a one way street
[01:48.00]I look above
[01:51.00]And I know I'll always be blessed with love
[02:01.00]And as the feeling grows
[02:04.00]She breathes flesh to my bones
[02:08.00]And when love is dead
[02:11.00]I'm loving angels instead
