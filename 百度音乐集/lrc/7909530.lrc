[00:00.22]这首歌送给陈均匀,希望老婆永远爱我!
[00:00.23]2007.11.12
[00:00.24]I close the door
[00:04.24]Like so many times, so many times before
[00:10.00]Felt like a scene on the cutting room floor
[00:16.00]When I let you walk away tonight
[00:22.00]I try to sleep, yeah
[00:26.00]But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
[00:33.00]A thousand more regrets unraveling, ohh
[00:38.00]If you were here right now, I swear,
[00:47.00]Baby I don't want to waste another day
[00:51.00]Keeping it inside it's killing me
[00:54.00]Cause all i ever want, it comes right down to you
[00:59.50]I'm wishing I could find the words to say
[01:02.00]Baby I would tell you every time you leave
[01:07.50]I'm inconsolable
[01:10.00]I climb the walls
[01:14.00]I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no.
[01:20.30]I've memorized the number
[01:22.80]So why can't I make the call?
[01:27.00]Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
[01:34.00]In the possibility
[01:38.70]Baby I don't want to waste another day
[01:43.00]Keeping it inside it's killing me
[01:46.30]Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you
[01:52.70]I'm wishing I could find the words to say
[01:55.60]Baby I would tell you every time you leave
[02:00.00]I'm inconsolable
[02:06.00]I don't want to be like this,
[02:08.60]I just want to let you know,
[02:12.00]Everything that I'm holding,
[02:15.00]Is everything I can't let go, can't let go.
[02:27.00]Baby I don't want to waste another day
[02:31.00]Keeping it inside it's killing me
[02:34.30]Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you
[02:40.50]I'm wishing I could find the words to say
[02:43.00]Baby I would tell you every time you leave
[02:47.80]I'm inconsolable
[02:54.20]Don't you know it baby
[02:56.85]I don't want to waste another day
[03:00.00]I'm wishing I could find the words to say
[03:04.00]Baby I would tell you every time you leave
[03:09.00]I'm inconsolable
[03:12.00]yeh...yeh...yeh...
[03:15.30]oh...
[03:18.00]I'm inconsolable
[03:20.30]oh.....yeh....
[03:24.00]I'm inconsolable
