[00:05.03]
[00:17.23]Somebody shakes when the wind blows
[00:22.89]Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
[00:28.50]Somebody's lacking a hero
[00:33.47]And they have not a clue
[00:36.26]When it's all gonna end
[00:42.60]Stories buried and untold
[00:48.15]Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
[00:53.88]When will this mystery unfold
[00:58.71]And will the sun ever shine
[01:01.56]In the blind man's eyes when he cries?
[01:08.08]You can change the world, I can't do it by myself
[01:13.90]You can touch the sky
[01:17.06]Gonna take somebody's help
[01:19.52]You're the chosen one
[01:22.11]I'm gonna need some kind of sign
[01:24.84]If we all cry at the same time tonight
[01:36.04]People laugh when they're feeling sad
[01:41.62]Someone is taking a life, hold on
[01:47.44]Respect to believe in your dreams
[01:51.93]Tell me where were you when your children cried last night?
[02:01.64]Faces fill with madness
[02:07.02]Miracles unheard of, hold on
[02:12.93]Faith is found in the winds
[02:17.56]All we have to do is reach for the truth
[02:26.95]You can change the world, I can't do it by myself
[02:32.53]You can touch the sky
[02:35.24]Gonna take somebody's help
[02:38.15]You're the chosen one
[02:40.85]I'm gonna need some kind of sign
[02:43.22]If we all cry at the same time tonight
[02:52.90]And when that flag blows
[02:58.73]There'll be no more wars
[03:05.33]And when all calls
[03:08.18]I will answer all your prayers
[03:17.25]You can change the world, I can't do it by myself
[03:23.24]You can touch the sky
[03:26.23]Gonna take somebody's help
[03:28.62]You're the chosen one
[03:31.45]I'm gonna need some kind of sign
