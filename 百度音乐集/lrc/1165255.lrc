[00:01.18]U Remind Me
[00:03.00]
[00:04.84]Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute
[00:08.70]but I got something to tell ya, listen.
[00:10.92]
[00:11.55]See the thing about you, that caught my eye,
[00:16.81]Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind.
[00:21.76]Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try.
[00:27.91]You need to sit down, this may take a while.
[00:31.86]You see, she sorta looks, just like you.
[00:36.92]She even smiles, just the way you do.
[00:41.66]So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled
[00:48.48]I'm reminded when I look at you, but,
[00:51.60]
[00:52.41]You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
[00:57.45]See her face whenever I, I look at you.
[01:02.41]You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
[01:08.69]This is why I just can't get with you.
[01:12.62]
[01:13.12]Thought that she was the one for me,
[01:17.81]Til I found out she was on her dream,
[01:22.28]Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
[01:29.43]This is why we could never be.
[01:32.95]
[01:33.35]You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
[01:38.47]See her face whenever I, I look at you.
[01:43.27]You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
[01:49.50]This is why I just can't get with you.
[01:52.54]I know
[01:55.28] it's so unfair to you,
[01:59.93]But I'd be lingering the rest to you,
[02:04.78]Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
[02:11.64]You remind me, whoa...
[02:21.52]
[02:24.59]You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
[02:29.19]See her face whenever I, I look at you.
[02:34.28]You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
[02:40.64]This is why I just can't get with you.
[02:44.52]
[03:46.61][03:25.53][03:05.40][02:44.97]You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
[03:50.83][03:30.64][03:10.27][02:49.58]See her face whenever I, I look at you.
[03:55.87][03:35.49][03:15.23][02:54.80]You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
[04:01.93][03:41.81][03:21.52][03:00.86]This is why I just can't get with you.
