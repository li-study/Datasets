[00:00.00]If I Could Be Where You Are

[00:11.24]Lyrics written by Roma Ryan

[00:17.12]Where are you this moment?
[00:26.68]only in my dreams.
[00:33.72]You're missing, but you're always
[00:40.94]a heartbeat from me.
[00:50.06]I'm lost now without you,
[00:56.85]I don't know where you are.
[01:04.07]I keep watching, I keep hoping,
[01:12.02]but time keeps us apart
[01:21.16]Is there a way I can find you,
[01:31.10]is there a sign I should know,
[01:39.97]is there a road I could follow,
[01:48.13]to bring you back home?
[01:58.83]Winter lies before me
[02:06.66]now you're so far away
[02:13.92]In the darkness of my dreaming
[02:22.05]The light of you will stay
[02:30.61]If I could be close beside you
[02:39.17]if I could be where you are
[02:47.52]if I could reach out and touch you
[02:55.74]and bring you back home
[03:04.95]Is there a way I can find you,
[03:13.09]is there a sign I should know,
[03:22.08]is there a road I could follow,
[03:30.85]to bring you back home to me
[03:45.81](End)
