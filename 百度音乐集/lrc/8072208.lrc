[00:00.98]I got your picture I'm coming with you
[00:03.35]Dear Maria, count me in
[00:06.06]There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
[00:09.68]And I'm the pen
[00:14.50]
[00:23.07]When the lights go off I wanna watch the way you
[00:26.74]Take the stage by storm
[00:28.32]The way you wrap those boys around your finger
[00:32.06]Go on and play the leader
[00:34.09]'Cause you know it's what you're good at
[00:36.63]The low road for the fast track
[00:39.25]Make every second last
[00:41.67]
[00:42.90]'Cause I got your picture I'm coming with you
[00:45.72]Dear Maria, count me in
[00:48.20]There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
[00:52.58]And I'm the pen
[00:53.60]Make it count when I'm the one Who's selling you out
[00:58.93]'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
[01:01.20]Calling your name from the crowd
[01:07.60]
[01:13.22]Then in the field you'll be the show girl of the home team
[01:18.85]I'll be the narrator
[01:22.74]Telling another tale of the American dream
[01:26.20]
[01:26.21]I see your name in lights
[01:28.84]We can make you a star
[01:31.54]Girl, we'll take the world by storm
[01:34.04]It isn't that hard
[01:35.50]
[01:35.57]'Cause I got your picture I'm coming with you

[01:51.76]'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
[01:54.60]Calling your name from the crowd
[01:57.28]Whoa...
[01:59.17]
[02:04.31]Ha ha..
[02:05.79]
[02:09.04]Take a breath, don't it sound so easy
[02:11.08]Never had a doubt
[02:12.07]Now I'm going crazy watching from the floor
[02:17.89]Take a breath and let the rest come easy
[02:21.48]Never settle down
[02:23.00]'Cause the cash flow leaves me always wanting more
[02:28.09]
[02:28.77]'Cause I got your picture I'm coming with you
[02:31.87]Dear Maria, count me in
[02:34.19]There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
[02:37.82]And I'm the pen
[02:39.84]Make it count when I'm the one Who's selling you out
[02:44.83]'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
[02:47.45]Calling your name from the crowd
[02:50.00]
[02:50.12]'Cause I got your picture I'm coming with you
