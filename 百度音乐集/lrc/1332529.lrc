[ar:pearl jam]

[00:16.00]Pirates, I'm sayin' they rob I
[00:20.00]Board the merchant ships
[00:24.00]I'm not sayin' we're not a part of it
[00:28.00]From the bottomless pit
[00:32.00]But my hands were made strong
[00:36.00]By the force of the Almighty
[00:39.00]They don't say that your generation, triumphantly
[00:49.00]Won't you help to sing
[00:53.00]These songs of freedom
[00:56.00]'Cause all I ever had
[01:01.00]Redemption song
[01:06.00]Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
[01:10.00]None but ourselves can free our mind
[01:14.00]Have no fear for atomic energy
[01:18.00]'Cause none of them can stop the time
[01:22.00]How long can they steal our prophets
[01:26.00]While we stand beside and look
[01:30.00]They don't say I'm your generation
[01:36.00]Oh, and I say...
[01:39.00]Won't you help to sing
[01:44.00]These songs of freedom
[01:47.00]'Cause all I ever had
[01:56.00][01:52.00]Redemption song  (2x)
[02:17.00]Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
[02:21.00]None but ourselves can free our mind
[02:25.00]Have no fear for atomic energy
[02:29.00]'Cause none of them can stop the time
[02:33.00]How long can they steal our prophets
[02:37.00]While we stand beside and look
[02:41.00]Say some say it's just a part of it
[02:45.00]You got to fulfill the book...
[02:50.00]Won't you help to sing
[02:54.00]These songs of freedom
[02:58.00]'Cause all I ever had
[03:03.00]Redemption song
[03:06.00]'Cause all I ever had
[03:15.00][03:11.00]Redemption song  (2x)
[03:19.00]This song of freedom
[03:24.00]Oh...
