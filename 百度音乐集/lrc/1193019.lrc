[00:38.50]An extra-ordinary guy
[00:41.50]Can never have an ordinary day
[00:44.50]He might live the long goodbye
[00:47.50]But that is not for me to say
[00:51.50]I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
[00:54.50]He is just a child with nothing to lose
[00:57.50]But his mind
[01:04.50]They are sleeping while they dream
[01:07.50]And then they want to be adored
[01:10.50]They who don't say what they mean
[01:13.50]Will live and die by their own sword
[01:17.50]I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
[01:20.50]They are like a child with nothing to lose
[01:23.50]In their minds, their minds
[01:28.50](Bridge)
[01:31.50]But I'll have my way
[01:37.50]In my own time
[01:43.50]I'll have my say
[01:50.50]My star will shine
[01:58.50](Chorus)

[02:12.50]Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by
[02:19.50]I've been and now I've gone
[02:34.50]There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years
[02:40.50]Many minds to educate the people who have disappeared
[02:47.50]D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?
[02:50.50]I am like a child with nothing to lose but my mind
[02:56.50]My mind
[03:00.50]But We'll have our way
[03:07.50]In our own time
[03:14.50]We'll have our say
[03:20.50]My star will shine
[03:29.50]Cos you see me I got my magic pie
[03:42.50]Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by
[03:49.50]I've been and now I've gone
[05:12.50]Cos you see me I got my magic pie
