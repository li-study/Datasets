[00:22.94]How I wish I could surrender my soul;
[00:33.87]Shed the clothes that become my skin;
[00:37.15]See the liar that burns within my needing.
[00:45.55]How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
[00:56.82]How I wish I had screamed out loud,
[00:59.50]Instead I've found no meaning.
[01:03.23]
[01:05.34]I guess it's time I run far, far away;
[01:11.10]find comfort in pain,
[01:14.46]All pleasure's the same:
[01:17.16]it just keeps me from trouble.
[01:20.08]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[01:25.79]I've heard what they say,
[01:28.53]but I'm not here for trouble.
[01:30.44]It's more than just words:
[01:33.98]it's just tears and rain.
[01:36.84]
[01:42.21]How I wish I could walk
[01:44.46]through the doors of my mind;
[01:48.61](Hold memory close at hand)
[01:53.48]Hold memory close at hand,
[01:56.41]Help me understand the years.
[02:04.70]How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
[02:15.97]How I wish I would save my soul.
[02:18.81]I'm so cold from fear.
[02:22.11]
[02:24.47]I guess it's time I run far, far away;
[02:30.33]find comfort in pain,
[02:33.08]All pleasure's the same:
[02:35.86]it just keeps me from trouble.
[02:38.75]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[02:44.95]I've heard what they say,
[02:47.64]but I'm not here for trouble.
[02:50.42]Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
[02:56.09]All pleasure's the same:
[02:58.68]it just keeps me from trouble.
[03:00.93]It's more than just words:
[03:04.37]it's just tears and rain.

[03:27.68]Tears and rain
[03:29.78]
[03:35.57]Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
[03:41.23]All pleasure's the same:
[03:43.99]it just keeps me from trouble.
[03:45.95]It's more than just words:
[03:52.24]it's just tears and rain.
