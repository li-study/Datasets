Turn Around
演唱 Shirley
词曲戴蕙心
Ooh Turn Around
Every time that I get to
see you smile it's all I need
Ooh Turn Around
I've got everything when I see you
looking back at me
The things I do
I'll cross the ocean,
baby, just to be with you
Can I let you know
That I cannot hide these feelings inside
'Cause Baby I would love
to make you mine
Standing right by your side
until the end of time
If only I had the words
it never seems to work out right
Could it be tonight?
Give me one more try
