[00:07.69]With a song of this title it was bound to be a success with the up and coming turn of the century.
[00:09.69]Luckily enough the song lived up to it's a name, it's pretty good! It became a number one hit.

[00:25.59]Some say that we are players
[00:28.11]Some say that we are pawns
[00:30.94]but we've been making money since the day that we were born
[00:35.39]Got to slow down, cause we'll low down.
[00:43.23]
[00:46.86]Round and round in circles live a life of solitude

[01:28.93]Live for liposuction, detox for your rent
[01:34.18]Overdose for Christmas and give it up for Lent
[01:39.43]My friends are all so cynical refuse to keep the faith
[01:44.76]We all enjoy the madness 'cause we know we're gonna fade away.
[01:48.95]We've got stars directing our fate
[01:54.03]And we're praying it's not too late

[03:00.13](Sometimes you know)
[03:01.46]
[03:03.80]And when we come we always come too late
[03:06.24]I often think that we were born to hate
[03:08.87]get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.
