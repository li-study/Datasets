[00:00.00]Alison
[00:10.00]Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.
[00:16.00]And with the way you look I understand
[00:19.00]that you were not impressed.
[00:22.00]But I heard you let that little friend of mine
[00:27.00]take off your party dress.
[00:32.00]I'm not going to get too sentimental
[00:37.00]like those other sticky valentines,
[00:44.00]'cause I don't know if you've been loving some body.
[00:49.00]I only know it isn't mine.
[00:54.00]Alison, I know this world is killing you.
[01:04.00]Oh, Alison, my aim is true.
[01:14.00]
[01:18.00]Well I see you've got a husband now.
[01:21.00]Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
[01:24.00]in the wedding cake?
[01:27.00]You used to hold him right in your hand.
[01:32.00]I'll bet he took all he could take.
[01:38.00]Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
[01:42.00]when I hear the silly things that you say.
[01:49.00]I think somebody better put out the big light,
[01:54.00]cause I can't stand to see you this way.
[01:58.00]
[02:00.00]Alison, I know this world is killing you.
[02:10.00]Oh, Alison, my aim is true.
[02:22.00]My aim is true.
