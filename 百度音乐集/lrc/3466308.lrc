[00:08.73]where I'm gonna to have you
[00:10.38]shell shock - fall back
[00:12.10]every one I see through
[00:14.11]watch your head spin
[00:15.51]like a mesocyclone
[00:17.09]bouncing off the walls
[00:18.58]now there's nowhere to run
[00:19.96]
[00:20.98]like a bullet
[00:22.15]meant to be shot
[00:24.17]you're the target
[00:25.43]dead on the spot
[00:27.54]when I focus
[00:28.79]I never miss
[00:30.79]it starts with a kiss
[01:44.75][00:34.31]
[01:58.12][01:44.94][00:47.61][00:34.49]she ricochets
[02:01.63][01:48.25][00:51.00][00:37.74]and you don't notice
[02:04.80][01:51.35][00:54.34][00:40.95]she's in your head
[02:08.11][01:54.69][00:57.63][00:44.23]and you just don't notice
[02:30.38][01:16.89]

[01:21.21]let it snow down
[01:22.51]now we're gonna deck halls
[01:24.50]I hit the bullseye
[01:25.92]making all the boys cry
[01:27.86]I hit the main line
[01:29.08]breaking through the night sky
[01:31.39]
[01:31.61]like a bullet
[01:32.61]meant to be shot
[01:34.63]you're the target
[01:35.85]dead on the spot
[01:37.98]when I focus
[01:39.31]I never miss
[01:41.30]it starts with a kiss
