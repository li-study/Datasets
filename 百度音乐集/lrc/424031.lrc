[00:15.95]The dawn breaks slowly in the east
[00:22.34]As day defeats the night
[00:28.57]The echo of your voice that greets
[00:34.96]The feeble morning light
[00:40.97]Is the only answer to my silent prayer
[00:47.81]And promises I never make
[00:53.66]You are always with me,you're always there
[01:00.33]In my dreams though I am wide awake
[01:07.59]And sometimes suffer a forbidden glance
[01:13.76]Will give my heart away
[01:19.93]The light that kinded out romance
[01:26.28]May flicker through the gray
[01:32.32]All the gold and silver at the rainbow's end
[01:39.05]All earthly goods I will forsake
[01:45.15]For each shooting star a wish I send
[01:51.69]And I dream though I am wide awake
[01:57.92]
[02:25.91]You were the rolling tidal wave
[02:32.10]That swept my barren shores
[02:38.91]If you will let me share your day
[02:44.93]My life's forever yours
[02:50.79]I will never undertand the reason why
[02:58.14]We fail to learn from out mistakes
[03:04.00]I will wait for you as the days go by
[03:10.66]With my dream though I am wide awake
[03:34.86]
