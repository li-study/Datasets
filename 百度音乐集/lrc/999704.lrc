[00:12.42]Forgive, sounds good
[00:18.43]Forget, I'm not sure I could
[00:24.43]They say time heals everything
[00:30.29]But I'm still waiting
[00:33.87]
[00:36.29]I'm through with doubt
[00:42.79]There's nothing left for me to figure out
[00:47.93]I've paid a price
[00:51.03]And I'll keep paying
[00:55.59]
[01:00.09]I'm not ready to make nice
[01:02.44]I'm not ready to back down
[01:05.67]I'm still mad as hell and
[01:07.82]I don't have time to go round and round and round
[01:10.82]It's too late to make it right
[01:14.01]I probably wouldn't if I could
[01:17.06]'Cause I'm mad as hell
[01:20.39]Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
[01:25.32]
[01:25.75]I know you said
[01:31.45]Can't you just get over it
[01:36.93]It turned my whole world around
[01:42.92]And I kind of like it
[01:45.19]
[01:50.07]I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
[01:51.59]With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
[01:54.73]It's a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
[01:57.21]Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
[02:00.03]And how in the world can the words that I said
[02:02.88]Send somebody so over the edge
[02:06.34]That they'd write me a letter
[02:07.94]Sayin' that I better shut up and sing
[02:10.71]Or my life will be over
[02:14.09]
[02:25.04]I'm not ready to make nice
[02:27.78]I'm not ready to back down
[02:31.00]I'm still mad as hell and
[02:33.88]I don't have time to go round and round and round
[02:36.93]It's too late to make it right
[02:39.59]I probably wouldn't if I could
[02:42.42]'Cause I'm mad as hell
[02:45.15]Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
[02:48.36]
[02:50.24]I'm not ready to make nice
[02:53.72]I'm not ready to back down
[02:56.21]I'm still mad as hell and
[02:58.48]I don't have time to go round and round and round
[02:59.68]It's too late to make it right
[03:02.49]I probably wouldn't if I could
[03:05.30]'Cause I'm mad as hell
[03:07.27]Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
[03:14.33]
[03:27.94]Forgive, sounds good
[03:34.56]Forget, I'm not sure I could
[03:40.84]They say time heals everything
[03:45.99]But I'm still waiting
