[00:16.23]
[00:18.23]There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
[00:23.79]That's a fact
[00:26.77]It's a thing we can't deny
[00:29.69]Like the fact that I will love you till I die
[00:34.95]
[00:38.49]We are twelve billion light years from the edge
[00:44.24]That's a guess
[00:46.74]No-one can ever say it's true
[00:50.36]But I know that I will always be with you
[00:55.68]
[00:58.87]I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday
[01:06.42]So don't call me a liar
[01:09.31]Just believe everything that I say
[01:14.54]
[01:14.99]There are six billion people in the world
[01:20.67]More or less
[01:23.63]And it makes me feel quite small
[01:27.25]But you're the one I love the most of all
[01:31.52]
[02:07.79]We're high on the wire
[02:10.58]With the world in our sight
[02:15.06]And I'll never tire
[02:17.81]Of the love that you give me every night
[02:22.90]
[02:23.33]There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
[02:29.23]That's a fact
[02:31.98]It's a thing we can't deny
[02:34.93]Like the fact that I will love you till I die
[02:40.03]
[02:43.58]And there are nine million bicycles in Beijing
[02:52.57]And you know that I will love you till I die
