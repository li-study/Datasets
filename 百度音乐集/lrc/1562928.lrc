[00:01.29]If I wrote a note to God
[00:08.71]I would speak whats in my soul
[00:16.43]i 'd ask for all the hate to be swept away
[00:22.35]For love to overflow
[00:33.52]If I wrote a note to God
[00:41.29]I'd pour my heart out on each page
[00:49.01]I'd ask for war to end
[00:52.54]For peace to mend this world
[00:57.28]I'd say, I'd say, I'd say
[01:05.46]
[01:06.98]Give us the strength to make it through
[01:10.19]Help us find love cause love is over due
[01:14.39]And it looks like we haven't got a clue
[01:18.44]Need some help from you
[01:23.66]Grant us the faith to carry on
[01:26.68]Give us hope when it seems all hope is gone
