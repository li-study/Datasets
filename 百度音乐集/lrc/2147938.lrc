[00:26.88]The camera pans the hourglass
[00:29.46]Days go and all I do is think of you
[00:33.46]And wonder where you are at night
[00:38.11]I remember everything
[00:41.02]Every smile even all the reasons why
[00:45.08]You say I pushed you out of my life
[00:48.58]
[00:48.66]Baby you send me
[00:54.48]Baby you send me
[00:58.20]I'm set adrift on memory bliss of you
[01:05.76]Baby you send me
[01:09.65]I'm set adrift on memory bliss
[01:12.69]Destiny is everything
[01:15.57]Reality's replaced you with
[01:17.95]The biggest empty void
[01:20.76]I've ever had in my life (ever had in life)
[01:24.67]I bet you say that I don't care
[01:27.09]I bet you say that I don't even think of you
[01:31.43]But God knows how wrong you are
[01:35.70]
[01:36.11]Baby will you be there
[01:38.44]when the mornin comes
[01:40.26]Just give me time (just give me time)
[01:43.17]To fix my life (to fix my life)
[01:47.29]Baby will you be there
[01:49.19]When I open my eyes
[01:51.86]After all the time I've spent
[01:55.37]Wishing you
[01:57.21]
[01:58.24]Baby you send me
[02:03.39]Baby you send me
[02:06.01]I'm set adrift on memory bliss of you
[02:12.55]Baby you send me
[02:18.88]I'm set adrift on memory bliss
[02:21.33]
[02:21.91]Sadness has overwhelmed me
[02:25.05]my mind flies carelessly
[02:27.48]I imagine that you're happy
[02:29.62]With your life right now
[02:33.43]I guess that's just the way it goes
[02:36.24]Forever's gone so now I must
[02:38.94]Place you with all the things
[02:41.62]That I can never have
[02:45.77]
[02:47.06]Baby you send me
[02:50.17]Baby you send me
[02:56.18]I'm set adrift on memory bliss
[02:59.80]
[03:06.21]Come on now
[03:10.61]I know this love is true
[03:13.96]I know this love is true
[03:17.60]
