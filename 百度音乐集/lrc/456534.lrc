[00:15.64]Goodbye my love
[00:18.15]I'm goanna miss you
[00:21.41]When I go I promise to forget
[00:27.00]I'd never twist a story sideways
[00:30.03]I was traveled different highways
[00:33.50]And it always leads me back to you again
[00:38.89]We connected through the distance
[00:41.78]With electric hearts somehow
[00:44.61]Still dreaming bout tomorrow-oh oh
[00:49.19]But all we have is now
[00:54.12]Now now
[00:56.10]All we have is now
[01:04.01]The future's on illusion
[01:06.63]Don't fall for empty vows
[01:10.17]All we have is now
[01:16.04]Staons on the paper
[01:18.29]Are tears from yesterday
[01:21.15]When the colors start to fade it's like it rained
[01:27.03]My thoughts could fill an ocean
[01:29.91]I'm drowing in emotion
[01:33.03]And we'll never have this moment back again
[01:39.40]Chain a light through all the bridges
[01:42.17]That somehow kisses the sky
[01:45.15]And the angels tart to cry
[01:49.89]Cause all we have is now
[01:56.23]All we have is now
[02:02.97]The future's on illusion
[02:06.59]Don't fall for empty vows
[02:10.43]All we have is now
[02:15.67]Sounds of silence cross our minds
[02:18.54]It's not the record playing
[02:21.67]We're closer
[02:23.01]All we have is now
[02:27.52]And in this one reality
[02:30.22]Single words come suddenly
[02:33.34]An accident of melody and harmany
[02:37.66]All we have is now
[02:41.34]
[02:55.54]Cause all we have is now
[03:02.23]All we have is now
[03:09.80]The future's on illusion
[03:12.72]Don't fall for empty vows
[03:16.51]All we have is now
[03:19.83]Cause all we have is now
[03:25.25]All we have is now
[03:33.74]The future's on illusion
[03:36.64]Don't fall for empty vows
[03:40.40]All we have is now
[03:44.11]
