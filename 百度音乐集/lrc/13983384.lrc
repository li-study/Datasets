[00:08.66]Jackson Browne
[00:10.43]
[00:22.09]Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
[00:28.91]Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
[00:35.79]In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-o-one
[00:42.91]I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on
[00:48.96]Running on, running on empty
[00:52.83]Running on, running blind
[00:56.02]Running on, running into the sun
[00:58.87]But I'm running behind
[01:04.16]Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
[01:11.11]Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
[01:17.99]In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
[01:25.15]I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on
[01:31.24]Running on, running on empty
[01:34.79]Running on, running blind
[01:38.38]Running on, running into the sun
[01:41.23]But I'm running behind
[01:46.68]
[02:07.87]Everyone I know, everywhere I go
[02:14.65]People need some reason to believe
[02:18.53][| I don't know about anyone but me
[02:21.89]If it takes all night, that'll be all right
[02:28.75]If I can get you to smile before I leave
[02:36.06]Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
[02:43.01]I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
[02:49.98]I look around for the friends that I used to turn to, to pull me through
[02:56.97]Looking into their eyes I see them running too
[03:03.07]Running on, running on empty
[03:06.59]Running on, running blind
[03:10.20]Running on, running into the sun
[03:13.07]But I'm running behind
[03:18.34]Honey, you really tempt me
[03:20.88]You know the way you look so kind
[03:25.15]I'd love to stick around
[03:26.98]But I'm running behind
[03:31.45]Running on
[03:32.45]You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
[03:36.58]Running behind
[03:39.77]Running into the sun but I'm running behind
[03:45.02]
