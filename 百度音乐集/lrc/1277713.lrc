[00:00.30]Windmills of your mind
[00:01.00]Dusty Springfield
[00:01.30]文质斌斌制作
[00:02.60]ROUND LIKE A CIRCLE IN A SPIRAL
[00:06.95]LIKE A WHEEL WITHIN A WHEEL
[00:09.78]NEVER ENDING OR BEGINNING
[00:12.63]ON AN EVER SPINNING REEL
[00:15.29]LIKE A SNOWBALL DOWN A MOUNTAIN,
[00:18.80]OR A CARNIVAL BALOON
[00:21.59]LIKE A CAROUSEL THAT'S TURNING,
[00:24.20]RUNNING RINGS AROUND THE MOON
[00:27.39]LIKE A CLOCK WHOSE HANDS ARE SWEEPING,
[00:30.59]PAST THE MINUTES OF IT'S FACE
[00:33.27]AND THE WORLD IS LIKE AN APPLE,
[00:36.26]WHIRLING SILENTLY IN SPACE
[00:40.59]LIKE THE CIRCLES THAT YOU FIND,
[00:45.46]IN THE WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND.
[00:55.32]
[01:00.52]TO A TUNNEL OF ITS OWN.
[01:05.00]DOWN A HOLLOW TO A CAVERN
[01:08.82]WHERE THE SUN HAS NEVER SHONE
[01:13.76]LIKE A DOOR THAT KEEPS REVOLVING
[01:17.55]IN A HALF FORGOOTEN DREAM
[01:21.78]OR THE RIPPLE FROM THE PEBBLE
[01:25.09]SOMEONE TOSSES IN A STREAM
[01:30.48]LIKE A CLOCK WHOSE HANDS ARE SWEEPING
[01:33.99]PAST THE MINUTES OF ITS FACE
[01:38.51]AND THE WORLD IS LIKE AN APPLE
[01:42.04]WHIRLING SILENTLY IN SPACE
[01:46.71]LIKE THE CIRCLES THAT YOU FIND,
[01:49.84]IN THE WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND.
[01:56.32]
[01:57.56]KEYS THAT JUNGLE IN YOUR ROCKET,
[02:01.50]WORDS THAT JANGLE IN YOUR HEAD.
[02:06.13]WHY DID SUMMER GO SO QUICKLY?
[02:09.58]WAS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID?
[02:14.10]LOVERS WALK ALONG THE SHORE,
[02:17.60]AND LEAVE THEIR FOOT PRINTS IN THE SAND.
[02:22.35]IS THE SOUND OF DISTANT DRUMMING,
[02:25.79]JUST THE FINGERS OF YOUR HAND?
[02:30.55]PICTURES HANGING IN A HALLWAY,
[02:33.99]AND THE FRAGMENT OF A SONG
[02:38.39]HALF REMEMBERED NAMES AND FACES,
[02:42.06]BUT TO WHOM DO THEY BELONG?
[02:46.11]WHEN YOU KNEW THAT IS WAS OVER,
[02:49.99]YOU WERE SUDDENLY AWARE
[02:54.84]THAT THE AUTUMN LEAVES WERE TURNING
[02:58.29]TO THE COLOUR OF HIS HAIR.
[03:02.27]ROUND LIKE A CIRCLE IN A SPIRAL
[03:05.97]LIKE A WHEEL WITHIN A WHEEL
[03:09.08]NEVER ENDING OR BEGINNING
[03:12.16]ON AN EVER SPINNING REEL
[03:15.51]AS THE IMAGES UNWIND,
[03:20.19]LIKE THE CIRCLES THAT YOU FIND，
[03:24.77]IN THE WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND.
