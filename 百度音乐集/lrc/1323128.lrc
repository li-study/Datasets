[00:05.50]
[00:16.46]It's a new day
[00:18.36]New day
[00:18.90]And it's evident
[00:20.41]You must've been heaven sent
[00:22.55]Something we should be hesitant
[00:24.53]
[00:24.82]But I'm not at all
[00:26.93]Just feeling more confident
[00:29.07]Just using my common sense
[00:31.15]Just trusting that I'm loving it
[00:33.13]
[00:33.70]I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
[00:37.66]Can't assume he's gonna use me
[00:39.82]And after him never call again
[00:41.75]
[00:42.26]Don't be afraid
[00:44.29]Don't be afraid
[00:46.44]This is your day
[00:48.64]This is your day
[00:50.15]
[00:50.77]It's time to be brave
[00:52.97]Say I'm not afraid
[00:55.10]Not anymore
[00:56.83]I used to be calm
[00:59.28]Now the temperature's changed
[01:01.52]It just ain't the same
[01:03.25]
[01:03.82]I'm not afraid
[01:05.96]I'm not afraid
[01:07.63]'Cause I've become brave
[01:09.89]As the light of day
[01:12.04]Straight into a cave
[01:14.15]To show me the way
[01:16.42]That I might be saved
[01:18.40]Now I'm turning the page
[01:20.64]Thanks to the power of love I can love
[01:24.77]Because I am brave
[01:27.23]
[01:27.87](I am brave, I am brave, yeah, oh...)
[01:41.87]
[01:42.50]I heard him say
[01:44.56]This thing movin' too fast for him
[01:46.56]It's a feeling that I'm straddling
[01:48.70]Foolishly adamant
[01:50.85]But it's all in his eyes
[01:53.11]Really wish he would let me in
[01:55.18]'Cause the same way you scared of him
[01:57.38]He's scared of bein' hurt again
[01:59.33]
[01:59.85]It's time to let go
[02:02.29]Let go of your heart
[02:04.07]It's time for a brand new start
[02:06.11]Never know we might never part
[02:09.17]Baby don't be afraid
[02:11.28]Don't be afraid
[02:13.48]This is your day
[02:15.68]This is your day
[02:17.06]
[02:17.51]It's time to be brave

[02:48.21]Thanks to the power of love I can love
[02:52.02]Because I am brave
[02:54.29]
[02:54.36]I wouldn't take back
[02:56.08]Anything that I've gone through
[02:58.67]I pray for strength
[03:00.22]For anything that I'm gonna do
[03:02.88]Whether it's joy or it's pain
[03:04.86]I'm still okay
[03:06.74]I'm gonna be alright
[03:07.88]Because I'm not afraid
