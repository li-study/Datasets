[01:23.80]The weekend comes to this town
[01:26.40]Seven days too soon
[01:33.77]For the ones who have to make up
[01:36.03]What we break up of their rules
[01:42.38]Well I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset
[01:45.84]Tell his boys they're in command
[01:48.42]While Chino danced a tango
[01:50.67]With a broomstick in his hand
[01:53.14]He said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time
[01:58.24]It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line
[02:03.50]To break on through to the other side
[02:06.06]Let it rock, let it go
[02:10.93]You can't stop a fire burning out of control
[02:16.03]Let it rock, let it go
[02:20.98]With the night you're on the loose
[02:24.40]You got to let it rock
[02:36.22]We go down to the Broadway
[02:38.38]Where everybody goes
[02:45.89]To get on their rockin' horse
[02:48.29]And blast that radio
[02:54.65]Well I saw Roxie on the table
[02:57.96]Her girlfriend down below
[03:00.61]They'll give it to the king of swing
[03:03.27]Before it's time to go
[03:05.81]They said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time
[03:10.63]It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line
[03:15.79]To break on through to the other side
[03:18.16]Let it rock, let it go
[03:23.21]You can't stop a fire burning out of control
[03:29.28]Let it rock, let it go
[03:33.23]You can't stop a fire burning out of control
[03:39.52]Let it rock, let it go
[03:43.40]With the night you're on the loose
[03:47.15]You got to let it rock
[04:28.15]Let it rock, let it go
[04:32.82]You can't stop a fire burning out of control
[04:37.75]Let it rock, let it go
[04:42.73]With the night you're on the loose
