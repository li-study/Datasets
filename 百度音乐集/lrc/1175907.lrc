[00:30.32]I'm running a fever baby
[00:35.06]That's burning down deep in my soul
[00:40.20]It stings like a needle lately
[00:44.04]that you've stuck in places you don't know
[00:48.52]Ohh
[00:49.58]I should mention my intentions are for you and I
[00:53.99]To come together do whatever but don't be suprised
[00:57.80]
[00:58.71]I don't pretend to be pretty
[01:00.93]Sometimes I tend to talk dirty
[01:03.26]I can be country or sitdown

[01:35.18]I'm trying to play them right
[01:39.29]so you can be well where we stand baby
[01:43.85]Your incentives got me questioning my motives now
[01:49.17]Before you get too deep you need to know what I'm about

[02:26.39]And there's never gonna be a time when I'm misunderstood
[02:30.65]I'll make you feel like you can't fly and then I'll get you good
[02:35.40]Be strong and make it, Lord
