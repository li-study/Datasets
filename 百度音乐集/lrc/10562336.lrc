[00:07.00]
[00:25.00]もう一度会いたい いないはずのあなたへ
[00:32.00]まだたまに届くDM见ゐ度に すべてかよみかえる
[00:40.00]Oh But foolish pride and impulsive decisions
[00:44.00]Somehow it just got in the way
[00:47.00]But still I know I believe in "Forever"
[00:51.00]And there's something that I just gotta say
[00:55.00]Tell me why,tell me why,oh why,oh why
[00:59.00]季节はすぎ
[01:03.00]Now that you have gone and
[01:05.00]I'm left with nothing else but my pride Oh
[01:10.00]Don't know why,don't know why,oh why,oh why
[01:15.00]今を忘れ
[01:18.00]Truth is that I never thought
[01:20.00]I'd miss your love so much when I cried
[01:24.00]私に会いたる
[01:34.00]Toughts of you posses my attetion
[01:37.00]Pictures fade from yellow to white
[01:41.00]When our two hearts beat together
[01:45.00]And the stars shine brightly at night Oh
[01:49.00]目に映るものすべて まぶしく感じて
[01:56.00]守られてたこと气づかず 强くなれた气がした
[02:03.00]Tell me why,oh why
[02:09.00]Fellings I can't deny
[02:12.00]深く吸い达む 空气は冷たすぎる Oh
[02:19.00]Don't know why,don't know why,oh why
[02:24.00]How should I feel inside Oh
[02:28.00]あなたわどこで 见あげているのでしよう もう一度会いたい
[03:04.00][02:56.00][02:49.00][02:41.00]あなたわどこで
