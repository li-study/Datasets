[00:03.20]Album: How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb
[00:05.63][00:23.58][03:35.15]
[00:30.57]I was born a child of grace
[00:34.04]Nothing else about the place
[00:37.68]Everything was ugly but your beautiful face
[00:40.90]And it left me no illusion
[00:44.70]I saw you in the curve of the moon
[00:48.01]In the shadow cast across my room
[00:51.95]You heard me in my tune
[00:55.04]When I just heard confusion
[00:59.28][01:02.68][01:06.19][01:52.56][01:56.05][01:59.72][03:16.36][03:19.57][03:23.30]All because of you
[01:09.16][02:02.73]I am...I am
[01:23.92]I like the sound of my own voice
[01:27.44]I didn't give anyone else a choice
[01:31.11]An intellectual tortoise
[01:34.62]Racing with your bullet train
[01:38.16]Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
[01:41.68]Some people got high rises on their backs
[01:45.44]I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
[01:48.97]You can make me perfect again
[03:02.23]I'm alive
[03:04.18]I'm being born
[03:05.53]I just arrived, I'm at the door
[03:09.07]Of the place I started out from
[03:12.14]And I want back inside
[03:26.47]I am
[03:28.11][03:29.43]
