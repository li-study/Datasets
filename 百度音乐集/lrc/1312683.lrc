[00:03.70]作詞∶Kenneth Edmonds
[00:05.70]作曲∶Kenneth Edmonds
[00:09.70]
[00:11.70]I was lonely
[00:17.84]I needed someone to see through
[00:24.40]I was at the end of my rope
[00:30.70]I needed someone to cut me loose
[00:37.20]Then an angel out the blue
[00:43.19]Gave me the sense that I might make it through
[00:48.82]And somehow I survived, with no thyme or reason
[00:56.85]And now I know I made it through
[01:00.53]The miracle of you
[01:02.11]
[03:54.83][02:35.33][01:04.02]I know the color of love
[03:57.61][02:39.19][01:07.16]It lives inside of you
[04:00.77][02:41.80][01:10.34]I know the color of truth
[04:03.97][02:44.84][01:13.30]It's in the image of you
[04:06.56][02:47.17][01:15.76]If it comes from the heart
[04:09.20][02:49.48][01:18.01]Then you know that it's true
[04:12.37][02:53.31][01:22.00]It will color your soul like a rainbow
[04:18.75][02:59.75][01:28.12]And the color of love is in you
[01:35.06]
[01:43.47]Like a bridge over (over) over troubled,
[01:52.41]troubled waters
[01:56.35]You stood beside me (stood beside me)
[02:01.47]And your love did not falter
[02:08.47]Then an angel, the angel in you
[02:14.74]Gave me the strength to trust the lord
[02:17.44]would see me through
[02:20.63]And that's how I survived, there's no other reason
[02:28.30]And now I know I made it, through the miracle of you
[03:06.04][02:33.99]
[03:16.00]So girl I wanna thank you
[03:19.13]I can't thank you enough
[03:22.05]For showing me the meaning
[03:25.03]The meaning of true love
[03:28.27]When I was lost and so in need
[03:31.45]You opened up your heart
[03:34.45]I needed you to comfort me
[03:37.35]You opened up your arms
[03:40.55]I couldn't face another day
[03:43.98]You said don't be afraid
[03:46.29]Your love came unconditional
[03:47.72]It showed my heart the way
[04:25.32]color of love is in you
[04:31.00][03:52.55]
