[00:15.87]Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
[00:25.11]Transcending space and time
[00:30.62]And I was rendered still
[00:36.10]There were no words for me to find at all
[00:44.90]As I stood there beside myself
[00:52.24]I could see you and no-one else
[01:00.16]When I saw you
[01:03.84]When I saw you
[01:07.41]I could not breathe
[01:10.96]I fell so deep
[01:14.62]Oh
[01:15.58]When I saw you
[01:19.30]When I saw you
[01:22.03]I’d never be
[01:25.66]I’d never be the same
[01:44.33]Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
[01:54.26]Changing you with the tide
[01:58.69]And dawn’s ribbon of light
[02:04.89]Bursts through the dark
[02:08.85]Wakening you inside
[02:13.84]And I thought it was all untrue
[02:21.11]Until there, all at once, I knew
[02:28.98]When I saw you
[02:32.74]When I saw you
[02:35.11]I could not breathe
[02:38.72]I fell so deep
[02:42.42]Oh
[02:43.33]When I saw you
[02:47.05]When I saw you
[02:50.74]I’d never be
[02:54.41]I’d never be the same
[02:59.94]With no beginning
[03:00.46]And without an end
[03:06.17]You are the one for me
[03:09.74]And it’s evident
[03:12.93]And your eyes told me so yeah
[03:20.65]Your eyes let me know
[03:31.87]When I saw you
[03:35.33]When I saw you
[03:38.70]I could not breathe
[03:42.44]I fell so deep
[03:46.12]Oh
[03:47.12]When I saw you
[03:50.71]When I saw you
[03:52.91]I’d never be
[03:56.64]I’d never be the same
