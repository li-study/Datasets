[00:00.00]
[00:13.76]I broke into your house last night
[00:20.37]And left a note at your bedside
[00:26.98]I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
[00:33.60]You leave me numb and I'm not sure why
[00:39.07]
[00:53.48]I find it easier to sit and stare
[01:00.09]Than push my limbs out towards you right there
[01:06.72]My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
[01:13.32]As blue as oceans and as pure as skies
[01:19.32]
[01:19.96]I struggle for the words and then give up
[01:26.13]My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
[01:32.76]A little piece of mind that I know better
[01:39.45]That the plain disgrace of all my letters
[01:44.39]
[01:59.75]After that the floodgates opened up
[02:06.27]And I fell in love with everyone I saw
[02:12.98]Please take your time I'm not in any rush
[02:19.52]And it's in everything I ever write
[02:24.88]
[02:26.11]It's not as if I need the extra weight
[02:32.32]Confused enough by life so thanks a lot
[02:39.00]Lonely written words for company
[02:45.60]Just raise the roof this once and follow me
[02:49.71]
[03:19.13]I struggle for the words and then give up
[03:25.34]My heads up with the birds on the t-hut
[03:31.99]A little piece of mind that I know better
[03:38.61]That the plain disgrace of all my letters
[03:43.17]
