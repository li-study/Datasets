[00:03.24]Didn'T We Almost Have It All
[00:06.69]演唱：Whitney Houston
[00:09.69]
[00:15.74]Remember when we held on in the rain
[00:20.05]The night we almost lost it
[00:24.61]Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
[00:35.58]Living on feelings
[00:40.08]Touching you I feel it all again
[00:47.44]
[00:47.79]Didn't we almost have it all
[00:54.31]When love was all we had worth giving
[01:03.07]The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
[01:10.23]Loving you makes life worth living
[01:17.74]Didn't we almost have it all
[01:24.60]The night we held on till the morning
[01:32.37]You know you'll never love that way again
[01:39.63]Didn't we almost have it all
[01:47.09]The way you used to touch me felt so fine
[01:51.65]We kept our hearts together down the line
[01:58.89]A moment in the soul can last forever
[02:07.11]Comfort and keep us
[02:11.81]Help me bring the feeling back again
[02:19.72]
[02:20.55]Didn't we almost have it all
[02:27.22]When love was all we had worth giving
[02:34.42]The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
[02:41.92]Loving you makes life worth living
[02:48.80]Didn't we almost have it all
[02:56.44]The night we held on till the morning
[03:03.80]You know you'll never love that way again
[03:11.36]Didn't we almost have it all
[03:15.12]Didn't we have the beat of times
[03:19.27]When love was young and new
[03:22.87]Couldn't we reach inside and find
[03:26.58]The world of me and you
[03:31.44]We'll never lose it again
[03:35.79]Cause once you know what love is
[03:39.45]You never let it end
[03:46.18]Didn't we almost have it all
[03:53.19]The night we held on till the morning
[04:00.59]You know you'll never love that way again
[04:08.37]Didn't we almost have it all
[04:15.30]
[04:19.28]Didn't we almost have it all
[04:28.82]
