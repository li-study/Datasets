[00:03.00]Album: The Way I Am
[00:04.80][00:15.60][03:22.07][03:23.51]
[00:20.58]I wanna taste the bittersweet, yeah
[00:25.34]I wanna start a riot in these city streets
[00:30.25]I don't wanna live life on repeat
[00:34.92]I don't wanna crash everything in the presidential suite
[00:39.12][00:57.89][01:23.00][02:31.19][02:50.78]Here I go again
[00:41.73][01:25.64][02:33.86][02:53.47]And I feel so good
[00:42.89][01:26.75][02:35.03][02:54.50]Yeah I feel so fine
[00:44.17][01:28.05][02:36.28][02:55.72]Like a hurricane
[00:46.43][01:30.41][02:38.76][02:58.25]I'm gonna fall again
[00:47.73][01:31.57][02:39.91][02:59.28]I'm gonna cross the line
[00:49.17][01:33.02][02:41.22][03:00.99]I can't wait another day
[00:53.91][01:37.79][02:46.05][03:05.73]I'm ready to be blown away
[01:04.47]Always looking for a thrill, yeah
[01:09.14]I love the chaos when I start a fire drill
[01:14.15]I have got so much time to kill
[01:18.81]I keep making promises I know I can't fulfill
[01:41.76][02:49.99][03:09.50][03:14.85][03:19.32]Here I go again
[01:47.84]Some days, frustration is on
[01:52.31]Feeling out of place, and all hope is gone
[01:57.09]In so many ways, the temptations too strong
[02:02.21]It's all good when it's wrong
[02:12.68]I wanna make somebody pay
[02:17.40]I wanna speak although
[02:19.26]I have got nothing to say
[02:22.51]Anything to make my day
[02:27.16]I'll run you over
[02:29.03]If you're standing in my way
[03:22.81]
