[00:11.86]I ask the air if it can breath
[00:17.11]Cause I can feel its breath on me
[00:22.41]I ask the stars if they can see
[00:27.95]Cause I can feel the rise on me
[00:33.35]And ask in science what it knows
[00:38.45]It only tells me what it don't
[00:43.96]And it talks to me in code
[00:49.37]A number hidden in a rose
[00:55.12]But I don't see what my eyes are supposed to see
[01:05.92]And I lost myself
[01:09.93]Do you need to question everything
[01:41.85]How long have you been looking down
[01:46.83]Or have I only just been found
[01:52.40]Cause I can feel you in the room
[01:57.66]Yea I can feel you all around
[02:03.75]I see you hiding in the palms of my hands
[02:13.05]And I'd be afraid to let you go
[02:25.34]But I don't see what my eyes are supposed to see
[02:36.20]And I lost myself
[02:40.51]Do you need to question everything
[02:46.37]Drop me if you please
[02:51.72]Miles are not enough for me
[02:59.55]You cut this atmosphere
[03:05.22]Torn down I let it breath again
