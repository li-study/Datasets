[00:00.00]Look to the rainbow
[00:02.64]小野丽莎
[00:04.39]
[00:14.73]On the day I was born,
[00:19.11]Said my father, said he.
[00:23.29]I'm an elegant legacy
[00:27.73]Waiting for ye,
[00:31.36]There's a rhyme for your lips
[00:35.11]And a song for your heart,
[00:38.92]To sing it whenever
[00:42.85]The world falls apart.
[00:46.33]
[00:47.35]Look, look
[00:51.11]Look to the rainbow.
[00:55.17]Follow it over the hill
[00:59.23]And the stream.
[01:03.35]Look, look
[01:06.92]Look to the rainbow.
[01:11.11]Follow the fellow
[01:15.04]Who follows the dream.
[01:19.44]
[01:21.67]Follow the fellow,
[01:25.73]Follow the fellow,
[01:30.23]Follow the fellow
[01:34.17]Who follows the dream.
[01:40.88]
[01:51.29]Twas a sumptuous gift
[01:55.04]To bequeath to a child.
[01:59.11]Or the lure of that song
[02:02.73]Kept her feet running wild.
[02:06.36]For you never grow old
[02:10.17]And you never stand still,
[02:14.17]With whippoorwills singing
[02:17.92]Beyond the next hill.
[02:21.09]
[02:21.92]Look, look
[02:25.67]Look to the rainbow.
[02:29.67]Follow it over the hill
[02:33.54]And the stream.
[02:37.48]Look, look
[02:41.23]Look to the rainbow.
[02:45.36]Follow the fellow
[02:49.17]Who follows the dream.
[02:53.04]
[02:55.54]Follow the fellow,
[02:59.36]Follow the fellow,
[03:03.86]Follow the fellow
[03:08.04]Who follows the dream.
[03:12.85]
[03:24.92]So I b my heart and I raom the world free
[03:32.98]To the east with a lark
[03:36.79]To the west with the sea
[03:40.61]And I searched all the world
[03:44.54]And I scanned all the sky
[03:48.17]But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes
[03:55.74]
[03:56.79]Look, look
[04:00.54]Look to the rainbow.
[04:04.48]Follow it over the hill
[04:08.48]And the stream.
[04:12.36]Look, look
[04:16.11]Look to the rainbow.
[04:20.17]Follow the fellow
[04:23.93]Who follows the dream.
[04:27.52]
[04:28.74]Look, look
[04:32.61]Look to the rainbow.
[04:36.36]Follow it over the hill
[04:40.49]And the stream.
[04:44.43]Look, look
[04:48.36]Look to the rainbow.
[04:52.36]Follow the fellow
[04:56.24]Who follows the dream.
[05:00.99]
[05:03.62]Follow the fellow,
[05:08.93]Follow the fellow,
[05:13.93]Follow the fellow
[05:18.43]Who follows the dream.
