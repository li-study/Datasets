[00:04.43]Stevie Wonder
[00:06.43]
[00:07.43]No new years's day
[00:11.69]to celebrate
[00:15.96]no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
[00:24.41]no first of spring
[00:28.72]no song to sing
[00:32.75]in fact here's just another ordinary day
[00:41.38]No April rain
[00:45.53]no flowers bloom
[00:49.76]no wedding saturday within the month of June
[00:58.25]But what it is
[01:02.51]Is something true
[01:06.70]Made up of these three words that I must say to you
[01:15.38]I just called to say I love you
[01:23.84]I just called to say how much I care
[01:31.99]I just called to say I love you
[01:40.78]And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
[01:48.97]No summer's high
[01:53.18]No warm July
[01:57.33]No harvest moon to light one tender August night
[02:05.90]No autumn breeze
[02:10.08]No falling leaves
[02:14.31]No even time for birds to fly to southern skies
[02:22.73]No libra sun
[02:27.00]No Halloween
[02:31.19]No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
[02:39.59]But what it is
[02:43.89]Though old so new
[02:48.04]To fill your heart like no three words Could ever do.
[02:56.76]I just called to say I love you
[03:05.22]I just called to say how much I care
[03:13.67]I just called to say I love you
[03:22.13]And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
[03:28.49]
[03:30.56]I just called to say I love you
[03:39.06]I just called to say how much I care
[03:47.79]I just called to say I love you
[03:55.90]And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
[04:02.18]
[04:03.37]Of my heart
[04:07.55]Of my heart
[04:15.78]
