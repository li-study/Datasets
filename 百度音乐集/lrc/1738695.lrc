[00:00.98]Stop breaking your heart
[00:04.19]You're making it hard on you
[00:11.97]Don't drive in reverse
[00:15.19]You've  been through the worst
[00:18.95]Put behind you
[00:22.61]It's only growing pains don't you know
[00:28.16]The only way to live is letting go
[00:31.96]
[00:35.09]This is a song for
[00:40.57]The broken harted
[00:46.14]The disappointed ones

[01:47.67]For hopes that are drowning
[01:53.14]When trust is a sinking store
[02:02.63]If you hear me
