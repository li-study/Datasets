[00:05.89]
[00:16.31]Galileo fell in love as a Galilean boy,
[00:25.89]And he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy,
[00:34.77]But the question got the better of his scientific mind
[00:43.62]And to his blind and dying days
[00:47.55]He looked up high and often sighed,
[00:53.63]And sometimes cried
[00:57.55]
[00:58.07]Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
[01:05.23]Who lights the stars at night?
[01:13.33]Who dreamt up someone so divine?
[01:20.61]Someone like you made them mine
[01:28.76]
[01:30.17]Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then
[01:37.49]But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
[01:47.45]I was lonely and unhappy
[01:51.79]And my lips were cold as ice
[01:56.68]But you kissed me, and good heavens,
[02:00.54]Now I’m here in paradise
[02:04.61]So if ever I’m not kissing you or looking in your eyes
[02:13.51]I won’t be blind, and I won’t cry
[02:17.63]I’ll look up high and gladly sigh
[02:23.86]And thank the guy
[02:27.99]
[02:28.49]Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
[02:35.58]Who lights the stars at night?
[02:43.19]Who dreamt up someone so divine?
[02:50.19]Someone like you made them mine
