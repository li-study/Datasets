[00:10.39]
[00:16.54]I'd love to win the lottery
[00:20.37]And move to Paris for good
[00:24.15]Get myself some of those fancy cars
[00:27.60]mansions with a couple of swimming pools
[00:31.03]
[00:32.22]I'd love to dress like a princess
[00:35.58]Chanel, versace, Miu Miu
[00:39.35]But none of them could ever make me smile
[00:42.98]The way that you do
[00:45.85]
[00:46.75]All I want is to be with you
[00:49.98]My sweet honey
[00:51.29]All I do I do it for you
[00:53.92]Can't you see
[00:54.94]I just want to be with you
[00:58.26]You're the reason for what I do
[01:01.12]
[01:18.01]Wine me and dine me is good
[01:21.80]Roses are pretty, that's true
[01:25.43]strong under the moonlight
[01:28.83]Champs Elysees Avenue
[01:31.97]
[01:33.63]But there is still something else
[01:37.15]I really want from you
[01:40.85]The proof that glitters on my ring finger
[01:45.19]A chance to say "I do"
[01:47.29]
[02:03.70]All I want is to be with you
[02:06.76]My sweet honey
[02:07.91]All I do I do it for you
[02:10.74]Can't you see
[02:11.75]I just want to be with you
[02:15.00]You're the reason for what I do
[02:18.81]All I want is to be with you
[02:21.74]
[02:22.11]My sweet honey
[02:23.44]All I do I do it for you
[02:26.05]Can't you see
[02:27.13]I just want to be with you
[02:30.37]You're the reason for what I do
