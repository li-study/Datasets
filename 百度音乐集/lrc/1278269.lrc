[00:19.25]Cos I can’t see
[00:21.27]I can’t see no more
[00:25.49]

[01:18.27]But I will run until my feet no longer run no more
[01:26.64]And I will kiss until my lips no longer feel no more
[01:34.26]And I will laugh until my heart it aches
[01:38.70]And I will love until my heart it breaks
[01:42.48]And I will love until there’s nothing more to live for
