[00:03.45]A little time to think
[00:06.80]But then she went to Cleveland
[00:08.64]With some guy named Leland
[00:10.40]That she met at the bank.
[00:12.40]
[00:13.17]Theres nothing wrong with Ohio
[00:16.45]Except the snow and the rain.

[01:07.66]It's not that easy to take
[01:10.84]She went to make a deposit
[01:12.66]Then she cleaned out her closet
[01:14.19]Guess i'll sit here and wait
[01:16.12]
[01:17.02]For her to come back home

[01:20.44]It shouldnt take very long
[01:22.01](So long, so long)
[01:23.78]I bet she misses the sunrise
[01:25.41]and misses the fruit flys
[01:27.08](but I could be wrong)
