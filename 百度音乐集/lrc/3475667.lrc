[00:16.86]i don\'t want to hear
[00:20.17]Another word from you now
[00:27.01]I\'d rather be wrong
[00:33.29]Life is mostly what
[00:37.07]You don\'t see anyway
[00:42.95]So just look away
[00:49.79]But our shadows
[00:52.69]Never leave us alone
[01:02.30]Down the bad roads
[01:08.14]They will follow us
[01:09.99]Faithfully home
[01:13.62]
[01:16.47]You launched the assault
[01:19.39]With the first cannonball
[01:22.17]My soldiers were sleeping
[01:28.77]I know that you thought
[01:31.94]It would never come down,
[01:36.31]Down to the wire
[01:42.98]It\'s friendly fire
[01:47.38]
[02:04.17]In your room filled with the things
[02:09.58]That you\'ve never done
[02:15.53]Does anyone really care
[02:21.96]Your shadow
[02:24.56]Just wont leave you alone
[02:34.27]\'cos he knows well
[02:38.08]He knows what you\'ve done
[02:48.28]
[02:48.57]You launched the assault
[02:50.97]With the first cannonball
[02:53.76]My soldiers were sleeping
[03:00.41]I know that you thought
[03:03.54]It could never come down,
[03:08.07]Down to the wire
[03:14.45]It\'s friendly fire
[03:18.40]
[03:19.64]Waves don\'t wonder
[03:21.84]When you\'re drowning
[03:26.68]Under the sea
[03:30.60]So don\'t look for me
[03:35.89]Find her keep her lose her
[03:40.45]Deserts you in the end
[03:47.11]You were my friend
[03:53.63]Like your shadow
[03:56.61]No one knows you as well
[04:01.18]As I do
[04:02.67]
[04:05.92]You launched the assault
[04:09.56]With the first cannonball
[04:12.39]My soldiers were sleeping
[04:16.11]I know that you thought
[04:22.35]It would never come down,
[04:26.45]Down to the ground
[04:33.07]\'cos I was so tired
[04:40.26]Then I\'ll get down
[04:44.63]Down to the wire
[04:52.59]It\'s friendly fire
