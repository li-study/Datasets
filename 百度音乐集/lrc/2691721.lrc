[00:01.37]Radiohead
[00:02.37]
[00:04.27]Her Green plastic watering can
[00:10.59]For her fake chinese rubber plant
[00:16.23]In fake plastic earth.
[00:21.15]
[00:29.55]That she bought from a rubber man
[00:36.49]In a town full of rubber plants
[00:42.12]Just to get rid of itself.
[00:52.11]And It Wears Her Out, it wears her out
[01:05.09]It wears her out, it wears her out.
[01:13.20]
[01:21.80]She lives with a broken man
[01:28.92]A cracked polystyrene man
[01:34.48]Who just crumbles and burns.
[01:39.59]
[01:48.19]He used to do surgery
[01:54.99]For girls in the eighties
[01:59.79]But gravity always wins.
[02:10.43]And It Wears Him Out, it wears him out
[02:23.38]It wears him out, it wears him out.
[02:40.64]She looks like the real thing
[02:47.15]She tastes like the real thing
[02:52.66]My Fake Plastic Love.
[02:58.20]
[03:06.20]But I can't help the feeling
[03:13.18]I could blow through the ceiling
[03:19.01]If I just turn and run
[03:28.72]And It Wears Me Out, it wears me out
[03:41.75]It wears me out, it wears me out.
[03:54.17]And if I could BE who you wanted
[04:00.83]If I could BE who you wanted,
[04:07.91]All the time, all the time, oh
[04:21.69]
