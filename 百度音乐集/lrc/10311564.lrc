[00:30.00]25 years of my life and still
[00:34.00]I'm trying to get up this great big hill of hope
[00:40.00]For a destination
[00:44.00]I realized quickly when I knew I should
[00:48.00]That the world was made up of this
[00:51.00]Brotherhood of man
[00:54.00]For whatever that means
[00:58.00]So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed
[01:02.00]To get it all out what's in my head
[01:06.00]Then I start feeling a little peculiar
[01:13.00]So I wake in the morning and I step
[01:16.00]Outside I take deep breath
[01:18.00]I get real high
[01:20.00]Then I scream from the top of my lungs
[01:23.00]What's goin' on
[01:27.00]And I say hey...
[01:34.00]And I say hey what's goin' on
[01:41.00]And I say hey...
[01:48.00]I said hey what's goin' on
[02:24.00]And I try, oh my God do I try
[02:30.00]I try all the time
[02:33.00]In this institution
[02:38.00]And I pray, oh my God do I pray
[02:44.00]I pray every single day
[02:48.00]For a revolution
[02:53.00]So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed
[02:56.00]To get it all out what's in my head
[03:00.00]Then I start feeling a little peculiar
[03:07.00]So I wake in the morning and I step outside
[03:10.00]I take a deep breaththen I get real high
[03:14.00]Then I scream from the top of my lungs
[03:17.00]What's goin' on
[03:20.00]And I say hey...
[03:28.00]And I say hey what's goin' on
[03:34.00]And I say hey...
[03:42.00]I said hey what's goin' on
[03:48.00]And I say hey...
[03:56.00]And I say hey what's goin' on
[04:02.00]And I say hey...
[04:10.00]I said hey what's goin' on
[04:32.00]25 years of my life and still
[04:37.00]I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
[04:43.00]For a destination
