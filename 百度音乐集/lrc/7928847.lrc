[00:26.04]Don’t hold yourself like that
[00:32.64]You’ll hurt your knees
[00:38.65]I kissed your mouth and back
[00:45.16]But that’s all I need
[00:51.53]Don’t build your world around
[00:57.58]volcanoes melt you down
[01:01.38]
[01:02.15]What I am to you is not real
[01:08.41]What I am to you you do not need
[01:14.58]What I am to you is not what you mean to me
[01:20.27]You give me miles and miles of mountains
[01:23.93]And I’ll ask for the sea
[01:28.38]
[01:53.71]Don’t throw yourself like that

[02:47.92]You give me miles and miles of mountains
[02:54.43]And I’ll ask for what I give to you
[02:57.30]Is just what i’m going through
[03:00.83]This is nothing new
[03:03.20]No no just another phase of finding what I really need
[03:10.18]Is what makes me bleed
[03:13.32]And like a new disease she’s still too young to treat
