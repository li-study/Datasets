[00:27.93]Cave-In Lyrics - Inspire Lyrics
[00:36.83]
[00:38.20]A vase of wilted flowers
[00:42.99]For those of you whove lost their powers
[00:48.20]No use in treading water
[00:52.92]Where theres no air to breathe in
[00:57.27]
[00:58.41]Help me find a way to move on
[01:03.60]Standing in the way of the sun
[01:08.58]Help me find you (you you), help you find me
[01:18.37]Now who inspires you?
[01:25.75]
[01:30.59]Her moods are so abrasive
[01:35.59]The sound is too persuasive
[01:40.68]Curve of the earth has gone straight
[01:45.73]Shall we go on one last date?
[01:50.49]
[01:51.36]Help me find a way to move on
[01:56.17]Standing in the way of the sun
[02:01.38]Help me find you (you you), help you find me
[02:11.22]Who inspires you?
[02:16.44]Who inspires you?
[02:21.49]Who inspires you?
[02:26.77]Who inspires you?
[02:32.13]
[02:51.08]Im sorry to inform you
[02:55.93]Sometimes love can deform you
[03:00.93]No time for hesitating
[03:06.06]Her rifle is cocked and waiting, cocked and waiting
[03:12.94]Aimed at me
[03:15.95]
[03:16.98]Help me find a way to move on
[03:21.77]Standing in the way of the sun
[03:26.67]Help me find you (you you), help you find me
[03:36.44]Now who inspires you?
[03:42.39]Who inspires you?
[03:52.71]Who inspires you?
