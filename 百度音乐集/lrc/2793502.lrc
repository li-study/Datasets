[00:01.00]Locomotive Breath (Lyric by V!ncent D.)
[00:11.07]In the shuffling madness
[00:13.74]Of the locomotive breath
[00:17.85]Runs the all time loser
[00:21.58]Headlong to his death
[00:24.43]And he feels the piston scraping
[00:28.38]Steam breaking on his brow
[00:32.01]Old Charlie stole the handle
[00:35.61]And the train, it won't stop going no way to slow down, oh
[00:48.05]He sees his children jumping off
[00:50.97]At stations one by one
[00:55.21]His woman and his best friend
[00:58.63]In bed and having fun
[01:01.92]And oh, he's crawling down the corridor
[01:06.19]On his hands and knees
[01:09.34]Old Charlie stole the handle
[01:12.57]And the train, it won't stop going no way to slow down, oh
[01:23.22]No way to slow down
[02:02.59]He hears the silence howling
[02:05.58]When he catches angels as they fall
[02:10.03]And the all time winner
[02:12.98]Has got him by the balls
[02:16.14]Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible
[02:19.56]And it's open at page one
[02:23.23]I think God, he stole the handle
[02:26.82]And the train, it won't stop going
[02:31.17]No way to slow down
[02:37.72]No way to slow down
[02:45.09]No way to slow down
[02:52.30]No way to slow down
[02:56.88]No way to slow down
[02:59.61]No way to slow down
[03:03.47]No way to slow down
[03:07.22]No way to slow down
[03:11.12]No way to slow down
[03:14.91]No way to slow down
[03:18.87]No way to slow down
