[00:00.00]Mazzy star---Into dust
[00:00.05](Taotm制作  to宝宝）
[00:36.04]Still falling
[00:46.98]Worthless and on begin
[00:58.37]Inside today
[01:10.22]Inside me today
[01:21.42]Around broken in two
[01:30.68]Til you eyes shed
[01:36.03]Into dust
[01:41.41]Like two strangers
[01:45.98]Turning into dust
[01:53.16]Til my hand shook away the fear
[02:29.28]I could possibly be fading
[02:39.14]Or have something more to gain
[02:50.59]I could feel myself growing colder
[03:01.71]I could feel myself under your fate
[03:17.92]Under your fate
[03:42.08]It was you breathless and tall
[03:53.66]I could fee my eyes turning into dust
[04:04.10]And two strangers turning into dust
[04:20.03]Turning into dust
[05:27.72]End
