[00:46.07]I lie awake
[00:49.78]I've gone to ground
[00:52.21]I'm watching porn
[00:54.78]In my hotel dressing gown
[00:58.89]Now I dream of you
[01:01.87]But I still believe
[01:05.51]There's only enough for one in this
[01:08.18]Lonely hotel suite
[01:14.45]The journey's long
[01:17.94]And it feels so bad
[01:20.85]I'm thinking back to the last day we had.
[01:27.92]Old moon fades into the new
[01:31.73]Soon I know I'll be back with you
[01:33.73]I'm nearly with you
[01:37.16]I'm nearly with you
[01:41.88]When I'm weak I draw strength from you
[01:47.57]And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
[01:54.53]And when I'm down you breathe life over me
[02:01.34]Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny
[02:23.26]On a clear day
[02:26.47]I'll fly home to you
[02:29.47]I'm bending time getting back to you
[02:37.27]Old moon fades into the new
[02:40.65]Soon I know I'll be back with you
[02:43.25]I'm nearly with you
[02:46.81]I'm nearly with you
[02:51.46]When I'm weak I draw strength from you
[02:57.08]And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
[03:04.00]And when I'm down you breathe life over me
[03:10.84]Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny
[03:20.15]When I'm weak I draw strength from you
[03:24.68]And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
[03:31.84]And when I'm down you breathe life over me
[03:38.64]Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny
[04:36.27]I'll fly, I'll fly home
[04:48.60]I'll fly home and I'll fly home
