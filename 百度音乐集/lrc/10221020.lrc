[00:15.11]I got the letter you left under my door
[00:19.47]Knocked me on my ass to the floor
[00:23.05]Never knew two words could take such a bite
[00:26.76]It said, “Dear Jon, Hello. Goodbye.”
[00:30.75]I saw your car parked outside Motel Cascade
[00:34.65]Saw two shadows go to town on the shade
[00:38.83]I can’t believe my own lyin’ eyes, oh my
[00:42.29]It better be your girlfriend I saw going down some other guy
[00:46.59]You told me you loved me, ‘til death do us part
[00:50.42]So tell me there’s a tombstone where there used to be a heart
[00:53.99]You said you couldn’t live without me
[00:56.31]So why aren’t you dead?
[00:57.82]Instead of six feet under you’re in someone else’s bed
[01:02.24]There’s just one thing that I can’t get through my head
[01:05.59]You said you couldn’t live without me so why aren’t you dead?
[01:17.16]I cut your face out of our old photographs
[01:21.06]And all the junk you left behind’s in the trash
[01:25.22]Well, I hoped you were a goner for sure
[01:29.09]Well, there’s been a resurrection, yeah, a miracle cure
[01:33.43]Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
[01:36.82]If you can’t trust the livin’ baby who can you trust?
[01:40.72]You said you couldn’t live without me
[01:42.90]So why aren’t you dead?
[01:44.56]Instead of six feet under you’re in someone else’s bed
[01:48.92]There’s just one thing that I can’t get through my head
[01:52.26]You said you couldn’t live without me so why aren’t you dead?
[02:12.16]Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
[02:15.57]If you can’t trust the livin’ baby who can you trust?
[02:22.08](You said you) couldn’t live without me
[02:23.67]So why aren’t you dead?
[02:25.13]Instead of six feet under you’re in someone else’s bed
[02:29.39]There’s just one thing that I can’t get through my head
[02:32.79]You said you couldn’t live without me baby, so why aren’t you dead?
[02:36.78]You said you couldn’t live with out me, what a surprise!
[02:40.68]Instead of laying you out I’m laying down on the line
[02:44.98]You spend my hard-earned money, you left me in the red
[02:48.32]You said you couldn’t live without me...so why aren’t you dead?
[03:01.23]So why aren’t you dead?
[03:09.17]Why aren’t you dead?
