[00:00.40]"Nothingness"
[00:01.28]Drowning Pool
[00:02.29]
[00:18.92]And this blood on my hands
[00:22.22]Now it won't go away
[00:26.12]I've been out on this road for days
[00:32.43]
[00:33.73]And the fear on the wall
[00:37.66]Watch it slowly cascade
[00:42.10]As the door holds the wolves at bay
[00:50.30]
[00:51.05]The emptiness is building from
[00:54.94]The nothingness that we've all become
[00:58.39]
[00:58.65]The emptiness is building from
[01:02.53]The nothingness that we've all become
[01:11.88]
[01:13.28]And this road that I've chose
[01:16.59]Seems it's taken its' toll
[01:20.59]Leading far far away from the soul
[01:28.38]
[01:28.59]And the fear on the wall
[01:31.94]Watch it slowly cascade
[01:36.40]As the door holds the wolves at bay
[01:45.11]
[01:45.24]The emptiness is building from
[01:49.09]The nothingness that we've all become
[01:52.51]
[01:52.85]The emptiness is building from
[01:56.53]The nothingness that we've all become
[02:01.73]
[02:23.48]This thing I've become seems its' taken control
[02:26.86]Of my mind and my body my will and my soul
[02:31.05]Driving further and further away from my self
[02:34.71]Until there's none of me left I've become something else
[02:38.94]
[02:39.38]The emptiness is building from
[02:43.19]The nothingness that we've all become
[02:46.54]
[02:47.07]The emptiness is building from
[02:50.99]The nothingness that we've all become
[02:54.98]The emptiness
[03:00.17]that we've all become...
[03:04.07]that we've all become...
[03:07.80]that we've all become...
