[00:03.50]Bizarre Love Triangle
[00:04.50]
[00:07.50]Every time I think of you
[00:10.50]I feel shot right through with a bow of gloom
[00:14.50]It's no problem of mine
[00:16.50]But it's a problem I find
[00:19.50]Living a life that I can't leave behind
[00:23.50]There's no sense in telling me
[00:27.50]The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
[00:30.50]But that's the way that it goes
[00:32.50]And it's what nobody knows
[00:34.50]While every day my confusion grows
[00:40.50]
[02:32.50][02:16.50][00:55.50]Every time I see you falling
[02:36.50][02:20.50][00:59.50]I get down on my knees and pray
[02:40.50][02:24.50][01:03.50]I'm waiting for that final moment
[02:44.50][02:28.50][01:07.50]You'll say the words that I can't say
[01:13.50]
[01:28.50]I feel fine and I feel good
[01:32.50]I'm feeling like I never should
[01:35.50]Whenever I get this way
[01:37.50]I just don't know what to say
[01:39.50]Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
[01:44.50]I'm not sure what this could mean
[01:48.50]I don't think you're what you seem
[01:51.50]I do admit to myself
[01:53.50]That if I hurt someone else
[01:55.50]Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
[02:51.50][02:00.50]
