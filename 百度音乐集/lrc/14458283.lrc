[00:50.20](originally by Phoenix)
[00:52.20]
[00:56.20]Counting all different ideas drifting away
[01:03.69]Past and present they don't matter
[01:06.05]Now the future's sorted out
[01:11.17]Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
[01:14.63]Think it's not what you say
[01:16.48]What you say is way too complicated
[01:19.10]For a minute thought I couldn't tell how to fall out
[01:23.57]
[01:27.55]It's twenty seconds till the last call
[01:31.27]You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey
[01:34.97]Lie down you know it's easy
[01:38.92]Like we did it over summer long
[01:42.61]And I'll be anything you ask and more
[01:46.35]You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
[01:49.94]It's not a miracle we needed
[01:53.82]No I wouldn't let you think so
[01:56.65]Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[02:04.17]Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[02:09.55]
[02:11.85]Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
[02:18.81]Past and present 1855-1901
[02:26.24]Watch them built up a material tower
[02:29.68]Think it's not gonna stay anyway
[02:32.37]Think it's overrated
[02:34.22]For a minute thought I couldn't tell how to fall out
[02:38.81]
[02:42.48]It's twenty seconds till the last call
[02:46.33]You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey
[02:50.08]Lie down you know it's easy
[02:53.83]Like we did it over summer long
[02:57.57]And I'll be anything you ask and more
[03:01.36]You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
[03:05.00]It's not a miracle we needed
[03:08.81]No I wouldn't let you think so
[03:11.72]Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[03:19.25]Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[03:27.02]
[03:41.73]Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
