[00:22.00]All the girl could want was a little attention
[00:24.00]From a man who's strong and not to mention
[00:26.00]Kiss and caressing her all night long
[00:32.00]But all that boy wants is to hit and run off
[00:34.00]He and his friends-they sit and they laugh
[00:37.00]Going around talking 'bout the girls they used in the past
[00:42.00]You ago get what's coming to you
[00:44.00]For all the bad bad things you do to your
[00:57.00][00:47.00]Lady, treat her like a lady
[01:01.00][00:51.00]U'll make a good girl crazy
[01:03.00][00:53.00]If you don't treat her like a lady.
[01:12.00]She stopped going to church, she don't wanna go to school
[01:15.00]She left with anger when he took her for a fool
[01:17.00]Even though her friends tell her to just keep cool
[01:22.00]Didn't tell her from the start just what he had planned
[01:25.00]Right in her face with another woman
[01:27.00]Now she's in jail for attacking her man
[02:58.00][01:32.00]You ago get what's coming to you
[03:01.00][01:35.00]For all the bad bad things you do to your

[04:01.00][03:59.00][03:56.00][03:54.00]Treat her like a lady.
[02:38.00]Tell it to her straight, she can take the truth
[02:41.00]Don't lead her on and leave her confused
[02:43.00]Anyone would rather be alone than be used
[02:48.00]Don't sit and think you'll hurt her feelings
[02:51.00]She only wants to know just what the deal is
[02:53.00]Next time beware of who's heart your breaking
