[00:00.11]Arcade Fire - Neon Bible
[00:01.76]
[00:20.41]Vial of hope and a vial of pain
[00:23.47]In the light they both looked the same
[00:26.13]Poured them out on into the world
[00:28.91]On every boy and every girl singing
[00:31.86]The Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
[00:36.91]Not much chance for survival
[00:39.49]If the Neon Bible is right
[00:43.34]
[00:48.69]Take the poison of your age
[00:51.04]Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
[00:53.63]What I know is what you know is right
[00:56.34]In the city you see only light
[00:58.47]It's the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
[01:04.33]Not much chance for survival
[01:06.94]If the Neon Bible is right
[01:10.90]
[01:16.16]Oh god, well, look at you now!
[01:18.68]Oh, you lost it, but you don't know how!
[01:21.41]In the light of a golden calf
[01:24.09]Oh god, I had to laugh!
[01:26.97]Take the poison of your age
[01:29.64]Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
[01:32.44]It was wrong but you said it was right
[01:35.18]In the future I will read at night
[01:37.55]In the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
[01:43.44]Not much chance for survival
[01:45.97]If the Neon Bible is true
