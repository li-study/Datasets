[00:00.01]Dawn of a New Century
[00:01.56]Imagine. Our planet floating silently in space.
[00:07.88]Around it, a white dove flies, forever circling.
[00:15.43]Every one hundred years, the dove's wing gently touches the face of the earth.
[00:21.59]The time it would take for the feathered wing to wear this planet down to nothing is eternity.
[00:28.00]
[02:59.62]Within eternity time passes.
[03:03.57]Within time, there is change.
[03:08.16]Soon the wing of the white dove will touch our world again.
[03:13.40]The dawn of a new century.
[03:17.69]Time for a new beginning.
[03:19.56]
[05:01.05][04:09.76]Now is eternity
[05:05.74][04:14.35]At the break of dawn of a century
[05:11.27][04:20.02]A thousand years of joy and tears
[05:17.04][04:25.67]We leave behind
[05:23.91][04:31.74]Love is our destiny
[05:28.36][04:36.91]Celebrate the dawn of a century
[05:33.97][04:42.59]Let voices ring, rejoice and sing
[05:39.67][04:48.30]Now is the time
[05:42.71][04:57.09]
[05:46.79]Love is eternity
[05:51.49]Dawn of a century
[05:53.31]Now is our destiny
[05:55.84]Dawn of a century
[05:58.49]Dawn of a century
