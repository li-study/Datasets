[00:00.37]Who is the master? Who is the slave?

[00:21.61]Treat me like a curse
[00:23.60]Then tell me I'm your saviour
[00:25.81]I never liked the stranger
[00:27.80]I used to know so well
[00:30.03]Waiting for your answer
[00:32.86]Is a kind of torture
[00:35.02]Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?
[00:38.81]
[00:39.42]Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
[00:44.12]Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
[00:48.48]Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
[00:52.43]Baby show me your hell
[00:54.99]
[00:56.75]Voices start to ring in your head
[01:00.04]Tell me what do they say
[01:05.14]Distant echoes from another time
[01:08.86]Start to creep in your brain
[01:13.52]So you're playing 'round, it's like it's a rewind
[01:17.58]You blew it so often that you start to believe it
[01:22.09]You have demons so nobody can blame you
[01:26.12]But who is the master and who is the slave?
[01:30.19]
[01:47.85]First you say you love me
[01:50.00]Then you wanna leave me
[01:52.15]Then you say you're sorry
[01:54.25]You play the game so well
[01:56.39]I bought your illusion
[01:58.58]You're the greatest salesman
[02:00.72]How could I refuse you
[02:01.96]When you sold it to yourself
[02:04.06]
[02:04.85]Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
[02:08.98]Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
[02:13.31]Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
[02:17.48]Baby show me your hell
[02:19.90]
[02:21.73]Voices start to ring in your head
[02:25.19]Tell me what do they say
[02:30.45]Distant echoes from another time
[02:34.22]Start to creep in your brain
[02:38.92]So you're playing 'round, it's like it's a rewind
[02:43.12]You blew it so often that you start to believe it
