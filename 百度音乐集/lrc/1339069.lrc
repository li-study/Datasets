[00:00.00]Wonderful Tonight
[00:05.62]Sing by Eric Clapton
[00:10.62]
[00:21.00]It's late in the evening
[00:26.00]She's wondering what clothes to wear
[00:31.00]She puts on her make up
[00:36.00]And brushes her long blond hair
[00:42.00]And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
[00:50.00]And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
[00:57.39]
[01:07.00]We go to a party
[01:12.00]And everyone turns to see
[01:17.00]This beautiful lady
[01:22.00]Is walking around with me
[01:27.00]And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
[01:35.00]And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
[01:43.00]
[01:45.00]I feel wonderful because I see the love
[01:52.00]Lighting in your eyes
[01:56.00]And the wonder of it all
[02:00.00]Is that you just don't realize
[02:04.00]How much I love you
[02:09.83]
[02:28.00]It's time to go home now
[02:32.00]And I've got an aching head
[02:37.00]So I give her the car keys
[02:42.00]And she helps me to bed
[02:48.00]And then I tell her
[02:52.00]As I turn off the light
[02:56.00]I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight"
[03:06.00]"Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight"
