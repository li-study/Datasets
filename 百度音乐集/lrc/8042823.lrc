[00:08.20]
[00:09.97]Paint me your picture and hang it on the wall
[00:17.31]Color it darkly, the lines will start to crawl
[00:25.15]Down...down...down
[00:28.88]Spin me around and around...
[00:32.71]Draw me away to the night from the day, leave not a trace to be found...
[00:40.34]Down...down...
[00:44.25]Nothing is real but the way that I feel and I feel like going -
[00:51.81]Down, down down, down down, down down,
[01:07.25]Paint me a picture of eyes that never see
[01:14.67]Flashes of lightning that burn for only me...
[01:22.34]Hey, hey, hey - there's only the devil to pay...
[01:29.93]I'm ready to go, pull me down from below
[01:33.91]Give me a place I can lay
[01:37.69]Hey Hey - nothing is real but the way that I feel and I feel like going
[01:48.93]Down, down down, down down, down down,
[02:02.95]
[02:31.28]Nothing is real but the way that I feel and I feel like going -
[02:42.48]Nothing is real but the way that I feel and I feel like going
[02:50.10]Down, down down, down down, down down,
[02:59.54]down down, down, down, down...
