[00:03.74]By noon
[00:06.96]There's a saying old says that love is blind
[00:12.96]Still were often told, "seek and you shall find"
[00:19.38]So I'm going to seek a certain that I've had in mind
[00:30.52]Looking everywhere, haven't found me yet
[00:35.85]He's the big affair I cannot forget
[00:43.29]Only man I ever think of with regret
[00:52.49]I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
[01:02.22]Tell me, where is the shepherdess for this lost lamb?
[01:16.91]
[01:19.49]There's somebody I'm longing to see
[01:26.78]I hope that he turns out to be
[01:34.45]Someone who'll watch over me
[01:46.17]
[01:47.61]I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
[01:55.14]I know I could always be good
[02:02.39]To one who'll watch over me
[02:14.18]Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome
[02:29.94]To my heart he carry the key
[02:43.63]Won't you tell me please to put on some speed, follow my lead
[02:55.19]Oh, how I need someone who'll watch over me
[04:00.56]
[04:04.94]Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome
[04:19.98]To my heart he carry the key
[04:34.97]Won't you tell me please to put on some speed, follow my lead
[04:46.03]Oh, how I need someone who'll watch over me
