[00:15.22]I should have listened to her,
[00:18.84]so hard to keep control.
[00:22.54]We kept on eating but our
[00:25.80]bloated bellies still not full.
[00:30.05]She gave us all she had but
[00:33.13]we went and took some more.
[00:37.36]Can't seem to shut her legs our
[00:40.30]mother nature is a whore.
[00:44.73]I got my propaganda I got revisionism.
[00:52.13]I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
[00:59.40]I'm a part of this great nation.
[01:06.77]I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism.
[01:17.82]Hypnotic sound of siren

[02:01.89]I'm a part of this great nation.
[02:09.66]I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism.
[02:28.26]All bruised and broken bleeding,
[02:31.76]she asks to take my hand.
[02:35.47]I turn just keep on walking.
[02:39.07]But you'd do the same thing in the circumstance I'm sure you understand.
[02:43.09]I got my propaganda I got revisionism.
[02:50.25]I got my violence, I got ultra-realism.
[02:57.36]I'm a part of this great nation.
[03:05.13]I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism.
