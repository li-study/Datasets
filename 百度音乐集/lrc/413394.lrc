[00:27.47]Saturday sun came early one morning
[00:37.55]In a sky so clear and blue
[00:49.91]Saturday sun came without warning
[01:00.18]So no-one knew what to do.
[01:12.01]Saturday sun brought people and faces
[01:23.51]That didn't seem much in their day
[01:34.01]But when I remember those people and places
[01:45.32]They were really too good in their way.
[01:57.53][01:55.06]In their way
[02:03.06]Saturday sun won't come and see me today.
[02:27.43]Think about stories with reason and rhyme
[02:38.10]Circling through your brain.
[02:49.51]And think about people in their season and time
[03:00.46]Returning again and again
[03:12.39][03:09.88]And again
[03:18.27]And Saturday's sun has turned to Sunday's rain.
[03:34.09]So Sunday sat in the Saturday sun
[03:44.68]And wept for a day gone by.
