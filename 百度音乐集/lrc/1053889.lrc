[00:06.38]寂しくて 言葉も出ない こんな夜は
[00:09.50]
[00:18.51]君の笑顔 抱きしめ眠ろう humm
[00:29.66]ふたりなら どしゃ降りの雨 凍える朝
[00:41.39]手をつないで きっと歩ける そばで
[00:51.34]I believe 消えかけた あの日の夢
[01:04.39]いつでも 手をかざし守る
[01:13.25]忘れない
[01:16.89]When I'm feeling small
[01:20.75]When It's cold outside
[01:23.51]I don't know who I should believe
[01:28.68]And when I needed someone special
[01:32.97]just by my side
[01:35.47]Who was there?
[01:38.85]I believe someday I will love
[01:48.55]Someone who's by my side
[01:52.17]Oh someday
[01:55.09]My special one will come alone
[01:58.76]I'll pray everyday
[02:02.40]
[02:22.70]I believe 消えかけた あの日の夢
[02:35.68]いつでも 手をかざし守る
[02:42.64]So I believe もしも風に ふるえている時は
[02:58.96]二人で探そう 日の射す場所
[03:06.57]
[03:09.49]Someday I will love
[03:12.85]Someone who's by my side
[03:16.26]Oh someday oh someday
[03:23.00]I keep on praying everyday
[03:28.95]
