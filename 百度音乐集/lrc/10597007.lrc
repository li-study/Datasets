[00:02.00]Pet Shop Boys - Pandemonium
[00:07.00]
[00:37.54]Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me?
[00:41.96]Why aren't we holding hands and talking sweet
[00:45.88]I love you really, though I know no-one believes me
[00:49.62]There's chaos every time we meet
[00:52.82]
[00:53.58]Oh, now look what you've gone and done
[00:57.51]You're creating pandemonium
[01:01.01]That song you sing means everything
[01:05.51]to me, I'm living in ecstasy
[01:08.78]The stars and the sun dance to your drum
[01:13.21]and now it's pandemonium!
[01:17.85]
[01:20.52]You're crashing everywhere, it's like you're smashing china
[01:24.05]Skidding on an icy road
[01:27.71]You're major trouble since you were almost a minor
[01:31.62]I sometimes think we'll both explode
[01:34.71]
[01:35.50]Oh, now look what you've gone and done
[01:39.41]You're creating pandemonium
[01:43.02]That song you sing means everything
[01:46.95]to me, I'm living in ecstasy
[01:50.19]
[01:51.09]My world's gone mad, what did you do
[01:54.45]Telling perfect strangers that I love you
[01:58.51]The stars and the sun dance to your drum
[02:02.63]and now it's pandemonium!
[02:06.92]
[02:09.72]I can't make sense of anything
[02:13.50]All I know is the party's in full swing
[02:17.58]If we both just stopped for a minute
[02:21.13]I declare war and then you'd win it
[02:25.05]
[02:31.74]To tell you the truth, I thought I was shockproof
[02:36.58]Until I saw what you get up to
[02:40.15]When you think about it, it's quite an achievement
[02:44.03]That after all I still love you
[02:47.28]
[02:48.17]Oh, now look what you've gone and done
[02:51.51]You're creating pandemonium
[02:55.59]That song you sing means everything
[02:59.32]to me, I'm living in ecstasy
[03:02.45]
[03:03.44]The world's gone mad, what did you do
[03:06.88]Telling perfect strangers that I love you
[03:10.71]The stars and the sun dance to your drum
[03:15.27]and now it's pandemonium!
[03:19.75]
