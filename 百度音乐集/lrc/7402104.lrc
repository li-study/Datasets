[00:00.88]Take This Longing
[00:03.75]Leonard Cohen
[00:06.98]
[00:07.46]Many men have loved the bells
[00:11.33]You fastened to the rein,
[00:16.39]And everyone who wanted you
[00:20.16]They found what they will always want again.
[00:27.72]Your beauty lost to you yourself
[00:31.27]Just as it was lost to them.
[00:34.59]
[00:36.14]Oh take this longing from my tongue,
[00:40.51]Whatever useless things these hands have done.
[00:45.97]Let me see your beauty broken down
[00:49.96]Like you would do for one you love.
[00:59.47]
[01:03.89]Your body like a searchlight
[01:08.60]My poverty revealed,
[01:13.45]I would like to try your charity
[01:17.87]Until you cry, "now you must try my greed."
[01:25.38]And everything depends upon
[01:28.88]How near you sleep to me
[01:31.80]
[01:33.66]Just take this longing from my tongue
[01:38.85]All the lonely things my hands have done.
[01:43.68]Let me see your beauty broken down
[01:48.41]Like you would do for one your love.
[01:56.19]
[02:01.34]Hungry as an archway
[02:05.85]Through which the troops have passed,
[02:10.62]I stand in ruins behind you,
[02:13.99]With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.
[02:22.59]I love to see you naked over there
[02:26.83]Especially from the back.
[02:29.33]
[02:31.00]Oh take this longing from my tongue,
[02:36.01]All the useless things my hands have done,
[02:40.54]Untie for me your hired blue gown,
[02:46.82]Like you would do for one that you love.
[02:53.96]
[02:57.93]You're faithful to the better man,
[03:02.75]I'm afraid that he left.
[03:07.35]So let me judge your love affair
[03:10.85]In this very room where i have sentenced
[03:15.04]Mine to death.
[03:19.00]I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
[03:22.46]That he's shaken from his head.
[03:25.74]
[03:27.29]Just take this longing from my tongue,
[03:32.34]All the useless things my hands have done,
[03:36.94]Let me see your beauty broken down,
[03:41.45]Like you would do for one you love.
[03:51.51]Like you would do for one you love.
[03:59.56]
