[00:04.28]Now and Forever (Richard Marx)
[00:11.31]
[00:13.40]Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head
[00:25.89]You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
[00:38.24]I lose my way but still you seem to understand
[00:47.82]Now and forever
[00:52.96]I will be your man.
[00:59.07]
[01:02.86]Sometimes I just hold you
[01:07.64]Too caught up in me to see
[01:15.07]I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
[01:27.47]I'll try to show you each and every way I can
[01:37.09]Now and forever
[01:42.03]I will be your man
[01:48.09]
[01:49.40]Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
[01:57.53]That I won't be alone anymore
[02:04.04]If I'd only known you were there all the time
[02:11.38]All this time
[02:18.60]
[02:41.54]Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
[02:50.96]Now and forever
[02:55.80]I will be your man
[03:02.02]
[03:03.20]Now and forever
[03:08.28]I will be your man
[03:20.22]
[03:24.25][THE END]
