[00:35.15]I got a girl and her name is mary
[00:39.24]I like to shock her on a basis daily
[00:43.57]I'd like to push you over into my stream
[00:47.76]I'd like to point out that her teeth are green
[00:51.91]
[00:52.25]I'll tell you stories that you won't understand
[00:56.23]I'll have you eating from the palm of my hand
[01:00.54]I'm gonna push you further into my dream
[01:04.81]The back of every head hold something obscene
[01:08.65]
[01:25.93]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[01:34.43]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[01:40.58]
[01:43.04]I get the feeling you're not ordinary
[01:47.12]I got a head like falling masonary
[01:51.54]I'll cut your strings ah yes a puppet machine
[01:55.68]I watch you drop and fall apart at the seams
[01:59.48]
[02:00.11]I meant to get you let there be no doubt
[02:04.18]You wanna try and get your teeth knocked out
[02:08.46]I'm gonna push you further into my dream
[02:12.76]The back of every head holds something obscene
[02:17.04]
[02:33.87]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[02:42.14]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[02:48.21]
[03:24.73]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[03:33.31]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
[03:41.80]Ah~~~~~ a ya yaa
