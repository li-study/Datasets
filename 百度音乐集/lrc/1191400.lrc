[00:39.64]Time
[00:43.03]goes
[00:47.03]slowly now in my life
[00:54.46]Fear
[00:58.30]no more
[01:02.06]of what I'm not sure
[01:07.94]Searching to feel your sole
[01:11.73]The strength to stand alone
[01:15.61]the power of not knowing and letting go
[01:25.19]I guess I've found my way
[01:32.30]it's simple when its right
[01:39.23]Feel lucky just to be here tonight
[01:44.90]and happy
[01:48.79]just be me and be alive.
[01:58.44]Love,
[02:02.10]in and out,
[02:05.83]a mile in my heart,
[02:13.44]And though life
[02:16.76]can be strange
[02:20.84]I can't be afraid
[02:26.75]Searching to feel your sole
[02:30.11]The strength to stand alone
[02:33.89]the power of not knowing and letting go
[02:43.67]I guess I've found my way
[02:50.89]it's simple when its right
[02:58.13]Feel lucky just to be here tonight
[03:04.13]and happy
[03:07.56]just be me and be alive.
[03:42.42]I guess I've found my way
[03:49.33]it's simple
[03:50.91]when its right
[03:56.74]feeling lucky just to be here tonight and
[04:02.72]happy
[04:06.29]just to be me and to be alive.
