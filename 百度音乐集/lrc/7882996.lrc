[00:01.12]Lights - Drive My Soul
[00:03.02]
[00:10.15]Seems somebody put out the moon,
[00:15.16]Now the road is a minefield.
[00:19.64]I can't follow the way she moves,
[00:24.22]I can't see past the shadows.
[00:27.60]
[00:27.90]You make the darkness disappear,
[00:31.97]I feel found when you stand near.
[00:36.34]I know where I am when you are here,
[00:40.46]My way becomes so clear.
[00:44.04]
[00:44.31]When you're gone,
[00:46.91]Will I lose control?
[00:51.15]You're the only road I know.
[00:55.77]You show me where to go.
[01:00.85]Who will drive my soul?
[01:05.92]
[01:07.96]Seems somebody burned up the signs,
[01:13.02]I can't expect the hard curves.
[01:17.30]There's no borders? there are no lines.
[01:21.95]How can I know where to turn?
[01:25.63]
[01:25.95]You make the street lights reappear,
[01:29.48]I feel bright when you stand near.
[01:34.34]I know what I am when you are here,
[01:38.37]My place becomes so clear.
[01:41.76]
[01:42.07]When you're gone,
[01:44.45]Will I lose control?
[01:48.87]You're the only road that I know.
[01:53.38]You show me where to go.
[01:58.79]Who will drive my soul?
[02:02.32]
[02:02.63]Will I lose control?
[02:06.69]You're the only road that I know.
[02:11.30]You show me where to go.
[02:16.13]Who will drive my soul-o-ul?
[02:26.46]Drive my soul-o-ul?
[02:35.71]
[02:36.07]When you're gone,
[02:37.95]Will I lose control?
[02:41.80]You're the only road I know.
[02:46.83]You show me where to go-o-o.
[02:52.70]
[02:53.02]When you're gone,
[02:55.89]Will I lose control?
[03:00.05]You're the only road I know.
[03:04.64]You show me where to go.
[03:09.70]Who will drive my soul?
