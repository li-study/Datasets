[00:25.71]Under this sun that's fit for a king
[00:28.79]I'm up against the rock
[00:31.61]I could have been anywhere else in the world
[00:34.91]I'm holding down this spot
[00:37.80]Nothing came close and nothing looked good
[00:41.35]I'm out there on the edge
[00:43.86]On the toe of it all a castle keeps an eye on the bay under sheets of haze
[00:49.86]Somewhere down there with crashing waves
[00:53.48]You kept plans for your grand escape
[00:56.62]And I won't see you no more
[00:59.88]You'll just hear me
[01:01.47]Cause I will scream send it out to sea
[01:07.23]I will live
[01:10.64]A mile beyond, a mile beyond that heart of yours
[01:16.50]It's broken ain't it torn?
[01:19.59]So you will leave for the last time,
[01:27.80]for the last time
[01:30.44]
[01:35.66]She set out one night for a place she'd never been
[01:39.75]Oh sweet my love
[01:41.69]How does it end?
[01:43.60]Did you find another house in the sun?
[01:46.12]Did you fall in love?
[01:48.04]You set sail but did not fail me
[01:51.38]Are you coming back again?
[01:54.15]Or have you run like I did?
[01:56.61]It's the last time you're gonna do it again
[01:59.85]It's in your blood just to say goodbye
[02:04.12]This time not for a while
[02:07.14]So find your heaven go on
[02:10.08]You don't need me
[02:11.70]So I will scream send it out to sea
[02:17.74]And I will live
[02:20.60]A mile beyond, a mile beyond that heart of yours
[02:27.14]Broken ain't it torn
[02:30.00]So you will leave for the last time,
[02:38.08]for the last time
[02:41.04]
[02:43.22]Coming to you in the middle of a cold night
[02:48.42]Can't arrest the sun but I've been trying
[02:53.95]I hear a song floating off a tidal wave
[02:58.41]It's alright, it's alright
[03:01.06]Nothing gonna touch when you've said goodbye
[03:04.39]It's alright, it's alright
[03:07.00]A million lost souls looking just like me
[03:10.13]Waiting on their love, but they don't believe
[03:14.85]
[03:34.40]There's a million lost souls looking just like me
[03:37.58]Waiting on permission but they don't believe
[03:41.22]
[03:44.11]I will scream and send it out to sea
[03:49.50]Somewhere between the rock face
[03:54.18]And the place that I used to know you more
[03:58.84]Waiting on the shore
[04:01.66]As you leave for the last time
[04:08.16]I will see you leave for the last time
[04:14.00]Until I breathe for the last time
[04:19.46]And then I will leave for the last time
[04:25.01]
