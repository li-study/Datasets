[00:10.21]They wake up in the morning
[00:12.11]And they drink their coffee black
[00:18.05]They love their women
[00:19.86]One beat shy of a heart attack
[00:26.12]On the way to work
[00:27.73]They might stop by a fishin' hole
[00:34.19]That's how country boys roll
[00:39.90]
[00:41.36]Yeah, they work, work, work
[00:43.79]All week 'til the job gets done
[00:50.15]Weekends they barbeque
[00:52.41]And have a cold one
[00:57.66]They run on a big old hog
[01:00.82]And a pinch of Skoal
[01:05.96]That's how country boys roll
[01:12.51]
[01:13.21]Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels
[01:15.65]Castin' their reels
[01:17.52]Way back on them old county roads
[01:21.66]Singin' in bars
[01:23.53]Soupin' up cars
[01:25.38]Just to see how fast they'll go
[01:29.05]From a ball and a glove
[01:31.05]To them fallin' in love
[01:32.98]They do everything heart and soul
[01:37.74]That's how country boys roll
[01:44.06]
[01:45.10]Well if you don't know your way around
[01:48.46]They'll draw you a map
[01:52.91]And if you're broke and you ask
[01:55.33]They'll give you the shirt off their back
[02:00.65]All they need is a little gas
[02:03.97]A few dollars to fold

[02:16.00]
[02:16.65]Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
[02:19.05]Castin' their reels
[02:20.95]Way back on them old county roads
[02:25.19]Singin' in bars
[02:26.96]Soupin' up cars
