[00:16.94]Cries in a distance
[00:19.05]Can't stop the tremble
[00:20.97]I'm just awaiting my turn
[00:23.52]
[00:24.93]Hiding will never
[00:26.98]Save me forever
[00:28.83]The guns gonna get me for sure
[00:31.66]
[00:33.00]Dear God I pray why won't you be my friend
[00:37.03]Come to me and take my hand
[00:41.02]Like mama would say
[00:42.98]Everything will be okay
[00:46.48]
[00:47.83]All I hear is 3 2 1
[00:50.83]The scream from the guns
[00:52.49]And then 1by1
[00:54.61]No one gets to run
[00:56.61]Someone's dad or mom
[00:58.68]Sister, brother and son
[01:01.48]No…no…
[01:03.40]
[01:04.04]All I feel is 1 2 3
[01:06.59]My tears start to bleed
[01:08.60]Smell of roses on my feet
[01:12.42]I feel sore…
[01:14.38]I fall…
[01:15.32]I call…
[01:16.35]I crawl…
[01:18.42]
[01:21.04]Cries in a distance
[01:23.06]Can't stop the tremble
[01:24.97]I'm just awaiting my turn
[01:27.64]
[01:28.99]Hiding will never
[01:31.11]Save me forever
