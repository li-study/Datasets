[00:14.30]One day, one night, one moment
[00:18.39]My dreams could be tomorrow
[00:22.74]One step, one fall, one falter
[00:27.12]East or West,
[00:29.44]Over earth or by ocean
[00:33.30]One way to be my journey
[00:37.46]This way could be my
[00:40.57]Book of Days
[01:03.01]No day, no night, no moment
[01:07.01]Can hold me back from trying
[01:11.88]One flag, one fall, one falter
[01:16.32]I'll find my day maybe
[01:19.79]Far and Away

[02:09.34]With a dream to be leaving
[02:14.03]One step, one fall, one falter
[02:18.45]Find a new world across a wide ocean
[02:24.60]This way became my journey
[02:28.71]This day brings together
[02:32.60]Far and Away
[02:39.04]This day brings together
[02:42.35]Far and Away
[02:45.37]Far and Away.
