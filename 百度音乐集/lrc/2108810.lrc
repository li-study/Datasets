[00:09.48]
[00:11.50]It's a long long journey
[00:16.77]Till I know where I'm supposed to be
[00:23.50]It's a long long journey
[00:28.50]I don't know if I can believe
[00:34.58]When shadows fall and block my eyes
[00:40.50]I am lost and know that I must hide
[00:46.71]It's a long long journey
[00:52.01]Till I find my way home to you
[00:59.50]Many days I've spent
[01:04.71]Drifting on through empty shores
[01:10.64]Wondering what's my purpose
[01:16.00]Wondering how to make me strong
[01:27.76]I know you'll be standing by my side
[01:31.50]I know I will falter I know I will cry
[01:34.06]It's a long long journey
[01:39.45]And I need to be close to you
[01:46.12]sometimes it feels no one understands
[01:51.71]I don't even know why I do the things I do
[01:57.50]When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul
[02:03.61]Will you break down these walls and pull me through
[02:18.06]Cause It's a long long journey
[02:25.36]Till I feel that I am worth the price
[02:31.11]You paid for me on calvary
[02:37.60]Beneath those stormy skies
[02:43.33]When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes
[02:48.40]It feel like everything is out to make me lose control
[02:58.56]Coze it's a long long journey
[03:06.68]Till I find my way home to you...to you
