[ti:i believe i can fly]

[00:01.97]I used to think that I could not go on
[00:08.82]And life was nothing but an awful song
[00:16.78]But now I know the meaning of true love
[00:24.58]I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
[00:31.91]If I can see it,
[00:35.77]then I can do it
[00:39.71]If I just believe it,
[00:43.63]there's nothing to it
[00:47.29]I believe I can fly
[00:51.36]I believe I can touch the sky
[00:55.08]I think about it every night and day
[00:58.97]Spread my wings and fly away
[01:03.16]I believe I can soar
[01:06.80]I see me running through that open door
[01:11.19]I believe I can fly
[01:14.93]I believe I can fly
[01:18.84]I believe I can fly
[01:28.65]See I was on the verge of breaking down
[01:35.20]Sometimes silence can seem so loud
[01:43.21]There are miracles in life I must achieve
[01:51.95]But first I know it starts inside of me, oh
[01:59.21]If I can see it,
[02:02.88]then I can be it
[02:06.95]If I just believe it,
[02:10.90]there's nothing to it
[02:14.39]I believe I can fly
[02:18.34]I believe I can touch the sky.
[02:22.30]I think about it every night and day
[02:26.15]Spread my wings and fly away
[02:30.32]I believe I can soar
[02:34.04]I see me running through that open door
[02:38.74]I believe I can fly
[02:42.31]I believe I can fly
[02:46.26]I believe I can fly
[02:53.08]Hey, because I believe in me, oh
[03:02.54]If I can see it,
[03:06.45] then I can do it
[03:10.62]If I just believe it,
[03:14.50]there's nothign to it
[03:18.07]I believe I can fly
[03:21.89]I believe I can touch the sky
[03:25.71]I think about it every night and day
[03:29.50]Spread my wings and fly away
[03:33.70]I believe I can soar
[03:37.39]I see me running through that open door
[03:41.99]I believe I can fly
[03:46.19]I believe I can fly
[03:49.76]I believe I can fly
[03:54.05]Hey, if I just spread my wings
[03:57.53]I can fly
[04:02.07]I can fly
[04:06.33]I can fly, hey
[04:09.99]If I just spread my wings
