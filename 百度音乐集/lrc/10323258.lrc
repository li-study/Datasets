[00:00.71]John Mayer - The Heart Of Life
[00:21.64]I hate to see you cry
[00:25.53]Lying there in that position
[00:32.17]There's things you need to hear
[00:36.36]So turn off your tears
[00:39.23]And listen
[00:43.29]Pain throws your heart to the ground
[00:48.77]Love turns the whole thing around
[00:54.10]No it won't all go the way it should
[01:00.08]But I know the heart of life is good
[01:17.48]You know, it's nothing new
[01:21.62]Bad news never had good timing
[01:28.23]But, then your circle of friends
[01:32.33]Will defend the silver lining
[01:39.10]Pain throws your heart to the ground
[01:44.89]Love turns the whole thing around
[01:50.08]No it won't all go the way it should
[01:54.98]But I know the heart of life is good

[02:25.31]Pain throws your heart to the ground
[02:30.57]Love turns the whole thing around
[02:36.00]Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
[02:41.19]But I know the heart of life is good
[02:46.59]I know it's good
