[00:00.00]Wilson Phillips - Release Me
[00:25.11][00:16.52][00:01.00]
[00:01.47]I know that it’s time for a change
[00:07.42]Mmm but when that change comes
[00:12.22]Will you still feel the same?
[00:21.31]
[00:30.11]How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
[00:39.99]I don’t want to give up
[00:42.75]But baby it’s time I had two feet on the ground
[01:23.54][00:53.84][00:48.95]Can you release me
[00:59.72]Now that you’re gone I can’t help myself from wondering
[01:08.10]Oh, if you’d have come down from your high
[01:13.62]Would we’ve been all right?
[04:36.60][04:22.13][04:17.11][04:12.48][02:13.59][02:08.63][01:19.22]Release me
[03:33.16][02:41.36][01:29.97]Come on baby, come on baby
[03:36.40][02:44.66][01:32.93]You knew it was time to just let go
[03:40.97][02:49.06][01:37.52]’cause we want to be free
[03:45.23][02:53.46][01:41.15]But somehow it’s just not that easy
[03:50.29][03:01.42][01:49.64]Come on darlin’, hear me darlin’
[03:56.96][03:04.71][01:52.95]’cause you’re a waste of time for me
[04:00.68][03:08.64][01:56.91]I’m trying to make you see
[04:05.00][03:13.10][02:01.33]That baby you’ve just got to release me
[02:19.07]I’m not going back to you anymore
[02:22.77]Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
[02:28.30]So stop coming around my door
[02:30.88]’cause you’re not gonna find
[02:34.55]What you’re looking for
[03:20.79]What is this power you’ve got on me
[03:25.53]What is this power, oh
[03:28.40]What is it,what is it
[04:46.24][04:26.52]Will you release me
[04:32.50]Ah...release me
