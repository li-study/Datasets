[00:00.60]Just Want You To Know
[00:01.86]Backstreet Boys
[00:03.57]
[00:04.66]Lookin' at your picture from when we first met
[00:08.95]You gave me a smile that I could never forget
[00:13.35]And nothing I could do
[00:15.75]Could protect me from you that night
[00:18.88]
[00:23.04]Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
[00:27.25]The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
[00:31.38]Yeah, you and I were anything, anything to me
[00:39.39]I just want you to know
[00:43.82]That I've been fighting to let you go
[00:48.41]Some days I make it through
[00:52.67]And then there's nights that never end
[00:57.02]I wish that I could believe
[01:01.75]That there's a day you'll come back to me
[01:06.57]But still I have to say
[01:11.02]I would do it all again
[01:15.92]Just want you to know
[01:18.03]
[01:19.59]All the doors are closing, I'm trying to move ahead
[01:23.78]And deep inside I wish it's me instead
[01:27.98]My dreams are empty from the day
[01:32.90]The day you slipped away
[01:35.69]And I just want you to know
[01:40.05]That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
[01:45.03]Some days I make it through
[01:49.61]And then there's nights that never end
[01:54.12]I wish that I could believe
[01:58.35]That there's a day you'll come back to me
[02:02.62]But still I have to say (yeah)
[02:08.12]I would do it all again
[02:12.56]Just want you to know
[02:14.43]
[02:14.85]That since I lost you
[02:17.30]I lost myself
[02:23.51]No I can't fake it
[02:26.02]There's no one else
[02:30.16]I just want you to know
[02:34.51]That I've been fighting to let you go
[02:39.15]Some days I make it through
[02:43.80]And then there's nights that never end
[02:48.22]I wish that I could believe
[02:52.71]That there's a day you'll come back to me
[02:57.19]But still I have to say (I have to say, I)
[03:02.26]I would do it all again (do it all again)
[03:06.80]I just want you to know (cause I can't fight it)
[03:10.04]That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
[03:14.42]
[03:15.49]Some days I make it through (and then there's)
[03:20.17]And then there's nights that never end
[03:24.35]I wish that I could believe (yeah)
[03:29.03]That there's a day you'll come back to me
[03:33.49]But still I have to say (but still I have to say)
[03:38.58]I would do it all again
[03:42.81]Just want you to know
