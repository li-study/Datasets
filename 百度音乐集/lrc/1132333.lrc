[00:16.10]Louder, louder
[00:17.66]The voices in my head
[00:19.71]Whispers taunting
[00:21.67]All the things you said
[00:23.71]Faster the days go by and I\'m still
[00:27.65]Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
[00:31.59]Time
[00:33.22]In the blink of an eye
[00:35.52]You held my hand, you held me tight
[00:39.51]Now you\'re gone
[00:41.47]And I\'m still crying
[00:43.53]Shocked, broken
[00:45.63]I\'m dying inside
[02:49.84][02:42.08][02:26.57][00:55.70]Where are you?
[02:28.26][01:53.97][00:58.13]I need you
[02:30.33][01:55.90][01:00.16]Don\'t leave me here on my own
[02:34.24][01:59.92][01:04.16]Speak to me
[02:36.21][02:02.08][01:06.18]Be near me
[02:38.26][02:03.93][01:08.11]I can\'t survive unless I know
[02:40.58][02:06.37][01:10.68]You\'re with me
[01:11.23]Shadows linger
[01:13.50]Only to my eye
[01:15.46]I see you, I feel you
[01:17.57]Don\'t leave my side
[01:19.42]It\'s not fair
[01:20.48]Just when I found my world
[01:23.25]They took you, they broke you
[01:25.25]They tore out your heart
[01:27.37]I miss you, you hurt me
[01:29.23]You left with a smile
[01:31.30]Mistaken, your sadness
[01:33.32]Was hiding inside
[01:35.47]Now all that\'s left
[01:37.15]Are the pieces to find
[01:39.36]The mystery you kept
[01:41.18]The soul behind a guise
[01:52.06]Where are you
[02:09.06]Why did you go?
[02:12.75]All these questions run through my mind
[02:16.81]I wish I couldn\'t feel at all
[02:20.33]Let me be numb
[02:22.20]I\'m starting to fall
[03:07.48][03:01.55][02:58.03]You were smiling
