[00:04.19]I’m not like them
[00:05.93]But I can pretend
[00:08.01]The sun is gone
[00:10.14]But I have a light
[00:12.44]The day is done
[00:14.53]But I’m having fun
[00:16.68]I think I’m dumb
[00:18.88]Or maybe just happy
[00:23.85]Think I’m just happy...Think I’m just happy
[00:38.69]My heart is broke
[00:40.61]But I have some glue
[00:42.91]Help me inhale
[00:44.94]And mend it with you
[00:47.13]We’ll float around
[00:49.29]And hang out on clouds
[00:51.48]Then we’ll come down
[00:53.64]And I have a hangover...I Have a hangover
[01:13.15]Skin the sun
[01:15.70]Fall asleep
[01:17.75]Wish away
[01:19.91]The soul is cheap
[01:22.25]Lesson learned
[01:24.55]Wish me luck
[01:26.50]SootheThe burn
[01:27.96]Wake me up
[01:31.30]I’m not like them
[01:33.22]But I can pretend
[01:35.45]The sun is gone
[01:37.68]But I have a light
[01:39.84]The day is done
[01:42.07]But I’m having fun
[01:44.74]I think I’m dumb
[01:46.79]Or maybe just happy
[01:51.67]Think I’m just happy...
[02:06.76]I think I’m dumb
