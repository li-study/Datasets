[00:15.45]The girl in the other room
[00:18.89]She knows by now
[00:22.40]There's something ain't know other fears
[00:29.40]Now she wears this thread bare
[00:32.90]She sits on the floor
[00:36.53]The glass press tight to the wall
[00:43.41]She hears murmurs low
[00:47.19]The paper is peeling
[00:50.53]Her eyes staring straight at the ceiling
[00:57.98]
[01:01.17]Baby be there
[01:04.67]Or maybe it's nothing at all
[01:09.70]As she draws lipstick smears on the wall
[01:14.26]
[01:14.51]The girl in the other room
[01:17.82]She powders her face
[01:21.49]And stares hard into her reflection
[01:28.40]
[02:43.02]The girl in the other room
[02:46.45]She stiffles a yawn
[02:49.87]Adjusting the strap of her gown
[02:56.56]She tosses her tresses
[02:59.90]Her lover undresses
[03:03.47]Turning the last night life down
[03:09.71]What's that voice we're hearing
[03:13.46]We should be sleeping
[03:16.99]Could there be someone who's weeping
[03:26.96]Maybe she's there
[03:30.47]Maybe there's nothing to see
[03:35.05]Just a trace of what used to be
[03:40.69]The girl in the other room
[03:43.65]She darkens her lash and blushes
[03:50.83]She seems to look familiar
