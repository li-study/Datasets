[00:17.04]Sleeping awake and awake
[00:20.22]when I'm sleeping
[00:22.94]I've got a dry kind of thirst
[00:26.13]when drenched
[00:28.87]On sunny days all I can see
[00:32.14]is as shadow
[00:34.80]and I'm not above being under
[00:40.84]I'm at the brink
[00:42.65]though I know that I'm empty
[00:46.76]I always hide when its my turn to seek
[00:52.26]my only believe
[00:53.93]is not to have faith in believing
[00:58.41]before I begin I'm over
[01:03.52]
[01:08.69]and I'm only not lonely
[01:11.03]when I'm lonely by myself
[01:15.59]Numb in pain again
[01:20.81]I always backtrack forward
[01:23.85]cuz all in all, I'm Disconnected
[01:29.94]Quietly loud
[01:31.88]while I'm noisily silent
[01:35.80]keep holding my breath
[01:37.58]while I'm trying to breath
[01:41.75]swimming against all of my waves and rapids
[01:48.09]I only win when I'm losing
[01:53.05]Broken off again
[01:58.28]and I'm only not lonely
[02:00.43]when I'm lonely by myself
[02:04.98]Numb in pain again
[02:10.33]I always backtrack forward
[02:13.35]cuz all in all, I'm Disconnected
[02:19.60]I just wanna live my life sedated
[02:23.48]Cuz I love driving myself away
[02:30.26]dysfunctionally sane don't give a damn
[02:34.86]I cant comprehend
[02:37.80]what I understand
[02:43.28]Disconnected
[02:44.66]broken off again
[02:50.95]and I'm only not lonely
[02:52.41]when I'm lonely by myself
[02:56.80]numb in pain again
[03:02.11]I always backtrack forward
[03:04.88]cuz all I know I'm Disconnected
[03:09.61]broken off again
[03:14.13]and I'm only not lonely
[03:16.17]when I'm lonely by myself
