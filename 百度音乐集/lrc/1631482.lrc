[00:00.16]My Last Serenade----Joey Moe
[00:04.83]Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm (4x)
[00:15.36]Don’t be surprised
[00:16.79]That these are my last words
[00:18.54]My last hour of my last day
[00:22.03]I’ve taken all the sorrow
[00:23.84]I can bear you
[00:25.71]And now I think I’ll turn
[00:27.33]Turn and walk away
[00:28.89]As wipe cause the tears are building up in my eyes
[00:32.31]Feel like I got nothing left to love in my life
[00:35.48]20 years of age and its time to say goodbye
[00:38.54]Cause I don't even want to try
[00:40.41]To make it through the night
[00:42.28]Tell them to forget the show tonight (And I don’t wanna sing)
[00:45.33]Tell them I’ve given up alright (And it don't even mean a thing)
[00:48.95]Make sure the headlines say (I did it for love)
[00:53.82]With you it all fades away,
[00:56.81]There’s no more words to say
[01:00.00]No more you and me,
[01:03.36]Cause the music left with you
[01:05.85]And now I’m alone on the balcony
[01:10.09]With no more songs to sing,
[01:13.15]Only this last serenade
[01:16.33]And you know I sing it for you
[01:21.00]It won’t be a lie
[01:22.50]If I told you my life was hurt
[01:25.35]Spring, summer, winter and fall
[01:28.59]Tell me what to do with this fame ya’ll
[01:31.64]And do my songs matter at all?
[01:35.13]Tell them to forget the video (And I don’t want to dance)
[01:38.32]Tell them I have left the city yo (And I’m not coming back)
[01:40.85]Make sure the headlines say (I did it for love )
[01:46.40]With you it all fades away,
[01:49.51]There’s no more words to say
[01:52.88]No more you and me,
[01:55.87]Cause the music left with you
[01:58.49]And now I’m alone on the balcony
[02:02.86]With no more songs to sing,
[02:07.43]Only this last serenade
[02:10.04]And you know I sing it for you
[02:15.65]Anything, I’ll do anything
[02:20.88]Please make me whole again
[02:23.56]You’re the reason why I sing
[02:28.39]Anything, I’ll do anything
[02:30.82]Please make me whole again
[02:36.36]You’re the reason why I sing
[02:39.91]With you it all fades away,
[02:42.65]There’s no more words to say
[02:45.96]No more you and me,
[02:49.26]Cause the music left with you
[02:51.95]And now I’m alone on the balcony
[02:56.12]With no more songs to sing,
[02:59.23]Only this last serenade
[03:02.36]And you know I sing it for you
[03:05.04](Come home, Come home)
