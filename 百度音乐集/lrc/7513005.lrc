[01:50.00][00:10.00]It must have been that moonglow
[01:54.00][00:14.00]Way up in the blue
[01:59.00][00:18.00]It must have been moonglow
[02:03.00][00:23.00]That led me straight to you
[02:07.00][00:27.00]I still hear you saying
[02:11.00][00:31.00]"Dear one, hold me fast"
[02:15.00][00:35.00]And I start in praying
[02:19.00][00:39.00]Oh lord, please let this last
[02:24.00][00:43.00]We seemed to float right thru the air
[02:31.00][00:51.00]Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
[02:40.00][01:00.00]And now when there's moonglow
[02:44.00][01:04.00]Way up in the blue
[02:49.00][01:09.00]I always remember that moonglow gave me you
