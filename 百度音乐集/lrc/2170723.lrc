[00:01.39]Whatsername
[00:05.45]Green Day
[00:09.24]By Pevy Jane
[00:12.89]
[00:21.39]Thought I ran into you down on the street
[00:29.26]Then it turned out to only be a dream
[00:37.34]I made a point to burn all of the photographs
[00:45.38]She went away and then I took a different path
[00:53.37]I remember the face
[00:55.56]But I cant recall the name
[01:01.18]Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
[01:06.98]
[01:21.22]Seems that she disappeared without a trace
[01:29.26]Did she ever marry ′ol Whatshisface
[01:36.74]I made a point to burn all of the photographs
[01:45.11]She went away and then I took a different path
[01:53.31]I remember the face
[01:55.48]But I cant recall the name
[02:00.66]Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
[02:05.70]
[02:36.41]Remember, whatever
[02:40.38]It seems like forever ago
[02:44.29]Remember, whatever
[02:48.19]It seems like forever ago
[02:52.36]The regrets are useless
[02:55.40]In my mind
[02:56.66]She′s in my head
[02:58.73]I must confess
[03:00.16]The regrets are useless
[03:03.22]In my mind
[03:04.57]She′s in my head
[03:06.16]From so long ago
[03:08.46]Go
[03:16.45]Go
[03:24.34]And in the darkest night
[03:28.27]If my memory serves me right
[03:32.25]I′ll never turn back time
[03:36.39]Forgetting you, but not the time...
[03:40.51]
[03:56.97]End
