[00:02.76]A Long Time Ago
[00:03.76]David Ford
[00:05.57]为了纪念..... / Sally_hi
[00:06.32]
[00:12.77]Clouds on the moon,
[00:14.87]It was a hollywood sky,
[00:17.71]I sat on the wall, 'til your parents drove by,
[00:22.22]And i walked to you door,
[00:24.95]And remember how you smiled,
[00:27.84]Well that was a long time ago.
[00:31.83]
[00:33.53]Your fault or mine,
[00:35.47]It's such a tough one to call,
[00:38.05]Do you one day look up to see your innocence fall,
[00:42.66]From a twelve storey window, to the concrete below,
[00:47.97]It was all such a long time ago.
[00:53.34]
[00:54.00]Now your path and mine,
[00:55.90]They never seem to converge,
[00:58.59]And now sat here in god-knows-where with a mouthful of words,
[01:03.13]Well they just sound like noises,
[01:06.14]If you say them enough,
[01:08.39]It was all such a long time ago.
[01:12.85]
[01:14.04]Now was it though?
[01:17.79]
[01:35.89]In some underground saloon,
[01:39.20]Where you can always get a drink,
[01:41.72]There's a girl by the cigarette machine,
[01:45.21]And i think i'll strike up a conversation,
[01:49.31]But i wouldn't know how,
[01:51.78]Doesn't seem such a good idea now...
[01:56.52]
[01:57.42]With the clouds on the moon,
[01:59.86]Another hollywood sky,
[02:02.58]It's time i dragged myself home and to wonder just why,
[02:07.54]I still think of you know,
[02:10.08]Only as you were then,
[02:12.36]
[02:12.97]It was all such a long time ago.
[02:16.30]
[02:18.31]Now was it though?
