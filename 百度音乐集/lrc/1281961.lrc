[00:01.69]Tim Mcgraw
[00:03.52]Taylor Swift
[00:06.34]
[00:14.19]You said the way my blue eyes shined,
[00:17.40]Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
[00:21.73]I said: "That's a lie"
[00:26.73]Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
[00:30.20]That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
[00:34.40]On backroads at night
[00:38.00]An' I was right there beside him all summer long
[00:44.90]An' then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone
[00:50.35]But when you think: Tim McGraw,
[00:53.17]I hope you think my favorite song
[00:56.38]The one we danced to all night long:
[00:59.81]The moon like a spotlight on the lake
[01:02.60]When you think happiness,
[01:05.62]I hope you think: "That little black dress"
[01:09.44]Think of my head on your chest,
[01:12.65]An' my old faded blue jeans
[01:15.55]When you think Tim McGraw,
[01:19.06]I hope you think of me
[01:23.59]September saw a month of tears,
[01:26.64]An' thankin' God that you weren't here,
[01:31.49]To see me like that
[01:36.07]But in a box beneath my bed,
[01:40.01]Is a letter that you never read,
[01:43.90]From three summers back
[01:48.52]It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,
[01:54.78]An' lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe:
[01:59.92]When you think: Tim McGraw,
[02:02.61]I hope you think my favorite song
[02:05.98]The one we danced to all night long:
[02:09.08]The moon like a spotlight on the lake
[02:12.03]When you think happiness,
[02:15.17]I hope you think: "That little black dress"
[02:19.13]Think of my head on your chest,
[02:22.07]An' my old faded blue jeans
[02:25.18]When you think Tim McGraw,
[02:27.75]I hope you think of me
[02:29.87]
[02:35.07]And I'm back for the first time since then:
[02:39.22]I'm standin' on your street,
[02:41.32]An' there's a letter left on your doorstep,
[02:44.66]An' the first thing that you'll read:
[02:48.70]Is: "When you think: Tim McGraw,
[02:51.53]"I hope you think my favorite song"
[02:54.76]Some day you'll turn your radio on,
[02:58.25]I hope it takes you back to that place
[03:01.39]When you think happiness,
[03:04.31]I hope you think: "That little black dress"
[03:07.83]Think of my head on your chest,
[03:11.09]An' my old faded blue jeans
[03:13.99]When you think Tim McGraw,
[03:16.84]I hope you think of me
[03:20.26]Oh, think of me,
[03:23.38]Mmmm
[03:28.64]
[03:31.43]You said the way my blue eyes shined,
[03:34.71]Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
[03:39.22]I said: "That's a lie"
[03:41.46]
