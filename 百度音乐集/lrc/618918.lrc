[00:01.64]
[00:13.21]Bring on your hunters
[00:15.70]Let them bring their dogs
[00:18.69]It's me that your wanted
[00:21.89]I've been right here all along
[00:28.45]Right here all along
[00:32.98]
[00:36.21]You better bring your buckets
[00:39.68]We've got some dreams to drain
[00:42.45]I'll be at the bottom
[00:45.48]I've been right here waiting so long
[00:52.23]Just waiting so long
[00:56.76]
[01:00.81]Dreams to drain
[01:03.48]Put them in a cage
[01:06.70]Unlock the pain
[01:09.29]And I'll be here waiting
[01:13.62]
[01:14.41]You fell asleep with the key
[01:17.62]All your walls
[01:20.20]Mean nothing to me
[01:23.23]I know you'll come back
[01:26.64]To set us free
[01:28.64]
[01:30.86]Run my dear son
[01:33.63]Until we get to the trees
[01:36.44]And then keep on going all the way
[01:39.01]We've got to get right down to the sea
[01:41.32]We've got to get to the sea
[01:44.75]
[01:46.15]Oh my dear son
[01:47.18]We're got to get to the sea
[01:50.92]
[01:54.52]But don't you touch the water
[01:57.32]Don't you barely breathe
[02:00.15]And if you see yourself
[02:02.09]Looking back at you
[02:03.29]You're going to have to leave
[02:04.91]You're going to have to leave
[02:09.14]I don't want you to go
[02:10.75]But you've got to leave
[02:14.41]
[02:18.62]Dreams to drain
[02:20.87]Put them in a cage
[02:23.71]Unlock the pain
[02:26.82]And I'll be here waiting
[02:31.04]
[02:31.59]You fell asleep with the key
[02:34.86]All your walls
[02:37.53]Mean nothing to me
[02:40.66]I know you'll come back
[02:43.76]You're going to set us free
[02:45.78]
[03:09.57]I don't want you to go
[03:10.83]But you've got to leave
[03:15.04]You can always come to me
[03:16.61]I'll give you what you need
[03:20.90]Run my dear son
[03:22.47]We've got to get to the sea
[03:25.92]
