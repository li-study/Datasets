[00:06.80]Mama they try and break me
[00:14.26]The window burns to light the way back home
[00:23.97]A light that warms no matter where they've gone
[00:32.70]They're off to find the hero of the day
[00:40.06]But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way
[00:46.78]Still the window burns
[00:48.88]Time so slowly turns
[00:51.12]And someone there is sighing
[00:55.04]Keepers of the flames
[00:56.90]Do ya feel your name?
[00:58.96]Can't you hear your babies crying?
[01:04.18]
[01:06.42]Mama they try and break me
[01:13.90]Still they try and break me
[01:20.46]
[01:22.41]excuse me while I tend to how I feel
[01:31.00]These things return to me that still seem real
[01:39.44]
[01:40.89]Now deservingly this easy chair
[01:47.90]But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
[01:55.00]Don't want your aid
[01:56.61]But the fist I've made
[01:58.29]For years can't hold or feel
[02:02.77]No, I'm not all me
[02:04.50]So please excuse me
[02:06.92]While I tend to how I feel
[02:10.96]
[02:15.50]But now the dreams and waking screams
[02:19.05]That ever last the night
[02:22.97]So build the wall, behind the crawl
[02:27.08]And hide until it's light
[02:31.00]So can you hear your babies crying now?
[02:37.94]
[02:51.00]Still the window burns
[02:53.06]Time so slowly turns
[02:55.67]And someone there is sighing
[02:59.22]Keepers of the flames
[03:01.27]Do ya feel your name?
[03:03.33]Can't you hear your babies crying?
[03:07.70]But now the dreams and waking screams
[03:11.28]That ever last the night
[03:15.39]So build the wall, behind the crawl
[03:19.87]And hide until it's light
[03:23.60]So can you hear your babies cryin' now?
[03:30.70]
[03:37.24]Mama they try and break me......
