[ti:]We're So Far Away
[ar:]Mae
[al:]The Everglow

[00:17.08]Remembering,
[00:19.60]everything
[00:22.36]about my world and when you came.
[00:26.60]Wondering
[00:29.00]if the change you'd bring
[00:30.93]means nothing else would be the same.
[00:33.71]
[00:34.20]Did you know what you were doing?
[00:37.41]Did you know?
[00:41.52]Did you know how you would move me Well?
[00:45.24]I don't really think so.
[00:48.19]But the night came down and swept us away.
[00:55.23]And the stars,
[00:56.15]they seemed,
[00:58.25]to paint the most elaborate scene to date.
[01:04.54]
[01:05.27]How could we know?
[01:07.27]That song, this show.
[01:09.42]We'd learn so much about ourselves from
[01:13.31]Toledo to Tokyo.
[01:16.45]The words were scribed on every page
[01:19.00]and now there's books up on our shelves.
[01:21.67]
[01:22.03]Did you know how you would move us?
[01:25.62]Did you know?
[01:30.42]When the lights first came upon
[01:32.67]us and we saw the Everglow.
[01:37.19]And the moment's magic swept us away.
[01:43.95]And a young man's dream was almost seen so plain.
[01:51.46]
[01:55.13]When was the night that showed us the sign?
[02:01.40]Revealed in the sky to leave all behind.
[02:07.49]But where to begin?
[02:10.36]Throwing caution to the wind,
[02:13.64]we reached for the stars.
[02:16.58]Everything was now ours.
[02:24.04]
[02:42.80]Did you know how you would move me?
[02:46.14]Did you know?
[02:50.73]Did you know how you would move me Well,
[02:54.51]I don't even think so.
[02:57.39]But the moment's magic swept us away.
[03:06.27]And it's so close but we're so far away.
[03:21.39]It's so close but we're so far away.
[03:31.52]
