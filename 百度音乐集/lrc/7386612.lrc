[00:07.23]Doktor Zoil--Spooky
[00:10.75]
[00:17.22]In the cool of the evening
[00:19.31]When everything is getting kind of Groovy
[00:26.05]You call me up and ask me
[00:27.98]Would I like to go with you and see a movie?
[00:32.58]
[00:34.90]First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight
[00:38.53]And then I stop and say all right
[00:43.53]Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
[00:49.36]
[00:52.35]You always keep me guessing
[00:54.30]I never seem to know what you are thinking
[01:00.59]And if a girl looks at you
[01:02.85]It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking
[01:07.68]
[01:10.03]I get confused, I never know where I stand
[01:13.74]And then you smile and hold my hand
[01:18.35]Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky
[01:32.14]
[01:44.95]If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are a playing
[01:53.60]I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's
[02:02.58]Just like a ghost you're a haunting my dreams
[02:10.75]Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky
