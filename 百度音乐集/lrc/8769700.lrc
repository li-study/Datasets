[00:00.00]Bright Eyes
[00:08.07]Art Garfunkel
[00:19.70]
[00:26.55]Is it a kind of a dream
[00:33.02]Floating out on the tide
[00:39.66]Following the river of death downstream
[00:44.85]Oh, is it a dream?
[00:48.28]
[00:49.61]There's a fog along the horizon
[00:56.52]A strange glow in the sky
[01:02.88]And nobody seems to know where you go
[01:08.37]And what does it mean?
[01:11.84]Oh, is it a dream?
[01:17.21]
[01:18.29]Bright eyes
[01:21.31]Burning like fire
[01:26.56]Bright eyes
[01:29.67]How can you close and fail?
[01:36.05]How can the light that burned so brightly
[01:40.21]Suddenly burn so pale?
[01:43.41]Bright eyes
[01:46.34]
[01:57.26]Is it a kind of shadow
[02:03.73]Reaching into the night
[02:10.22]Wandering over the hills unseen
[02:15.57]Or is it a dream?
[02:18.85]
[02:20.21]There's a high wind in the trees
[02:27.15]A cold sound in the air
[02:33.56]And nobody ever knows when you go
[02:38.97]And where do you start
[02:42.42]Oh, into the dark
[02:47.84]
[02:48.78]Bright eyes
[02:52.11]Burning like fire
[02:57.37]Bright eyes
[03:00.51]How can you close and fail?
[03:06.85]How can the light that burned so brightly
[03:11.13]Suddenly burn so pale?
[03:14.30]Bright eyes
[03:18.54]Bright eyes
[03:21.74]Burning like fire
[03:27.05]Bright eyes
[03:30.20]How can you close and fail?
[03:36.49]How can the light that burned so brightly
[03:40.77]Suddenly burn so pale?
[03:43.97]Bright eyes
[03:47.26]
