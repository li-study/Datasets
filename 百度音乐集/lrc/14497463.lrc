( hank williams )
Today i passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
Cat Power
I can't help it if i'm still in love with you
Someone else stood by your side
She looked so satisfied
I can't help it
I'm still in love with you
As i brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly i got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it
I am still in love with you
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way i used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much i miss you
I can't help it
I'm still in love with you
