[02:11.56]I can\'t believe and I never thought
[02:15.11]Days would come to an end
[02:19.19]Well maybe someday we\'ll meet again
[02:23.42]If ever that day never comes
[02:27.39]It would be too soon
[02:31.36]My love
[02:38.52]
[02:40.85]I\'ve been waiting for the chance to nullify this increment
[02:46.59]Pull the cord to detonate
[02:49.06]So sick of you don\'t speak of me
[02:51.39]No represent of misery
[02:53.34]An only savior of masochists
