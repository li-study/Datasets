[00:00.47]Take Me Away
[00:02.32]
[00:11.21]I cannot find a way
[00:13.29]To describe it
[00:14.82]It's there
[00:16.07]Inside
[00:17.30]All I do is hide
[00:19.71]I wish
[00:20.98]That it
[00:22.13]Would just go away
[00:24.54]What would
[00:25.82]You do?
[00:26.99]You do?
[00:27.61]If you knew...
[00:29.67]What would you do?
[00:32.22]
[00:33.65]All the pain
[00:34.43]I thought I knew
[00:35.60]All these thoughts lead back to you
[00:38.02]Back to what
[00:39.27]Was never said
[00:40.56]Back and forth
[00:41.79]Inside my head
[00:42.97]I can't handle this confusion
[00:48.38]I'm unable
[00:50.85]Come and take me away
[00:55.05]
[00:58.64]I feel
[00:59.63]Like I
[01:01.35]Am alone
[01:03.50]All by
[01:04.74]Myself
[01:05.90]I need to get around this
[01:08.35]My words
[01:09.58]Are cold
[01:10.71]I don't want them to hurt you
[01:13.33]If I
[01:14.38]Show you
[01:15.52]I don't think you'd understand
[01:18.02]Cause no one understsands
[01:20.52]
[01:22.04]All the pain
[01:22.94]I thought I knew
[01:24.22]All these thoughts lead back to you
[01:26.60]Back to what
[01:27.86]Was never said
[01:29.13]Back and forth
[01:30.20]Inside my head
[01:31.61]I can't handle this confusion
[01:36.98]I'm unable
[01:39.40]Come and take me away
[01:45.19]
[01:45.60]I'm going nowhere
[01:47.48]On and on and...
[01:50.36]I'm getting nowhere
[01:52.24]On and on and...
[01:53.86]Take me away
[01:55.97]I'm going nowhere
[01:57.43]On and on and...
[02:00.60]Up and on and
[02:02.19]Up and on
[02:03.74]All the pain
[02:04.61]I thought I knew
[02:05.82]All these thoughts lead back to you
[02:08.72]Back to what
[02:09.41]Was never said
[02:10.69]Back and forth
[02:11.79]Inside my head
[02:13.09]I can't handle this confusion
[02:18.72]I'm unable
[02:20.90]Come and take me away
[02:27.30]Take me away
[02:31.72]Take me away
