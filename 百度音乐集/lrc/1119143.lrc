[00:22.73]I can't get my feet up off the edge
[00:26.28]I kinda like the little rush you get
[00:29.42]When you're standing close to death
[00:32.16]I think you're driving me crazy
[00:34.50]
[00:34.53]Hold on as we crash into the earth
[00:37.63]A bit of pain will help you suffer
[00:40.61]when you're hurt for real
[00:43.66]Cause you're driving me crazy
[00:45.80]
[00:45.90]By your lips, the word's a robbery
[00:48.80]Do you grin inside? You're killing me
[00:51.42]All along we talked of forever
[00:54.13]I kinda think that we won't get better
[00:56.77]It's the longest start
[00:57.91]The end's not too far away
[01:00.50]Did you know? I'm here to stay
[01:02.93]
[01:03.00]We'll stagger home after midnight
[01:05.78]Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
[01:08.48]We'll fall apart on the weekend
[01:11.38]These nights go on and on and on
[01:16.06]
[01:19.60]I can't get your voice out of my head
[01:23.69]All I hear are the many echoes of
[01:26.60]The darkest words you said
[01:29.31]And it's driving me crazy
[01:31.48]
[01:31.58]I can't find the best in all of this
[01:34.93]But I'm always looking out for you
[01:38.00]Cause you're the one I miss
[01:40.73]And it's driving me crazy
[01:42.35]
[01:42.63]By your lips, the word's a robbery
[01:45.76]Do you grin inside? You're killing me
[01:48.56]All along we talked of forever
[01:51.22]I kinda think that we won't get better
[01:53.95]It's the longest start
