[00:11.44]Nothing I must do
[00:21.04]Nowhere I should be
[00:27.42]No one in my life
[00:33.35]To answer to, but me
[00:40.87]No more candlelights
[00:47.80]No more purple skies
[00:54.66]No one to be near
[01:00.59]As my heart slowly dies
[03:01.81][01:07.83]If I could hold you One More Time
[03:09.14][01:15.10]Like in the days when you were mine
[03:15.81][01:21.62]I′d look at you
[03:19.66][01:24.81]Till I was blind
[03:23.42][01:28.27]So you would stay
[03:29.16][01:34.72]I′d say a prayer each time you smile
[03:36.93][01:41.39]Cradle the moments like a child
[03:43.27][01:48.72]I′d stop the world if only I
[03:50.03][01:55.22]Could hold you one more time
[02:03.32]Mmmmmm. . .
[02:09.71]I′ve memorized your face
[02:15.50]I know your touch by heart
[02:21.72]Still lost in your embrace
[02:28.47]I dream of where you are
[04:03.50][03:57.56]one more time
