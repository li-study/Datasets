[00:29.22]It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
[00:35.72]Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
[00:42.35]Got so sick of crying
[00:45.79]So just lately
[00:49.42]When I catch myself I do a 180
[00:57.25]I stay up clean the house
[00:59.87]At least I'm not drinking
[01:03.75]Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
[01:10.36]That silent sense of content
[01:13.60]That everyone gets
[01:17.72]Just disappears soon as the sun sets
[02:47.97][01:51.26][01:23.68]
[01:25.21]This face in my dreams seizes my guts
[02:52.75][01:28.80]He floods me with dread
[02:56.54][01:32.19]Soaked in soul
[02:58.64][01:34.30]He swims in my eyes by the bed
[03:03.31][01:39.24]Pour myself over him
[03:06.73][01:42.23]Moon spilling in
[03:32.07][03:25.11][03:18.04][03:11.01][01:46.89]And I wake up alone
[01:54.01]If I was my heart
[01:55.64]I'd rather be restless
[01:59.68]The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
[02:06.38]This ache in my chest
[02:09.90]As my day is done now
[02:13.50]The dark covers me and I cannot run now
[02:21.73]My blood running cold
[02:24.22]I stand before him
[02:28.80]It's all I can do to assure him
[02:34.59]When he comes to me
[02:37.50]I drip for him tonight
[02:41.85]Drowning in me we bathe under blue light
[02:49.33]His face in my dreams seizes my guts
