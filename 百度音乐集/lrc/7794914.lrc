[00:05.89]
[00:14.06]I've been trying to win
[00:16.25]Trying to fend for myself way too long
[00:21.11]Living in doubt, living without, I’ve been so alone
[00:27.98]I know that I need you, and I know that I need you now
[00:39.32]I was wasting my time trying to find
[00:44.74]Something real for my soul
[00:47.21]And now that I’m here, you’re making it clear
[00:50.75]I’m not my own
[00:54.21]I know that I need you, and I know that I need you now
[01:01.34]
[01:06.25]Now, this is where I stand
[01:12.64]Here, with my outstretched hands
[01:20.29]Now, I'm giving you everything now
[01:28.79]
[01:33.38]I’m running in place to try and erase all that I've done
[01:40.01]But you find a way to replace my pain with love
[01:46.87]And I know that I need you, I know that I need you now
[01:54.96]
[01:58.83]Now, this is where I stand
[02:05.40]Here, with my outstretched hands
[02:12.74]Now, I'm giving you everything now
[02:21.00]
[02:26.38]When I'm afraid, you comfort me
[02:33.11]When I'm ashamed, you lift me up
[02:42.43]Yeah you lift me up
[02:47.49]
[02:51.59]Now, this is where I stand
[02:58.21]Here, with my outstretched hands
[03:05.42]Now, I'm giving you everything now
[03:13.59]
[03:17.78]Now, this is all that I want
[03:24.30]Here, is where I belong
[03:32.34]Now, I'm giving you everything now
[03:41.51]
[03:45.47]When I'm afraid, you comfort me
[03:51.79]When I’m ashamed, you show me how
[04:01.50]I need you now
