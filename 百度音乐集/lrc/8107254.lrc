[ar:]Silje Nergaard
[al:]At first light

[00:13.84]Here we are
[00:17.03]Out of cigarettes
[00:20.25]Holding hands and yawning
[00:23.81]Look how late it gets
[00:27.04]Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[00:33.65]And too much in love to say goodnight
[00:39.24]
[00:41.00]Here we are
[00:44.36]In the cozy chair
[00:47.73]Picking on a wishbone
[00:51.08]From the Frigidaire
[00:54.68]Two sleepy people with nothing to say
[01:01.21]And too much in love to break away
[01:06.77]
[01:07.67]Do you remember
[01:10.33]The nights we used to linger in the hall?
[01:16.04]Father didn't like you at all
[01:21.72]Do you remember
[01:24.02]The reason why we married in the fall?
[01:29.38]To get a little rest
[01:32.34]To get this little nest
[01:36.11]
[01:36.67]Well, here we are
[01:40.00]Just about the same
[01:43.40]Foggy little fella
[01:46.71]Drowsy little dame
[01:50.72]Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[01:57.04]And too much in love to say goodnight
[02:04.36]
