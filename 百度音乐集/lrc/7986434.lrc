[00:09.41]《壮志凌云》插曲
[00:14.49]获1986年奥斯卡奖
[00:24.59]Turn around to see you
[00:27.15]In a crowded place
[00:28.84]I watch for the emotions
[00:30.78]On a guarded face
[00:32.66]Saying lead me on
[00:33.76]
[00:36.09]Victim of a dream
[00:37.35]And a memory
[00:38.85]But when I try to break free
[00:40.77]You say to me
[00:40.80]C'mon lead me on
[00:46.62]A matter out of time
[00:49.08]In the reaches of space
[00:54.21]Caught up in the patterns
[00:55.29]In the light of a life
[00:57.16]Walk across the bridge
[00:58.92]To the shadows of the night
[01:00.62](Chorus)
[01:00.68]Saying lead me on
[02:00.66][01:02.82]Lead me on
[02:02.78][01:04.26]Lead me on
[02:06.31][01:05.97]On and on
[01:23.19]Voices in the night
[01:26.66]Chase the demons away
[01:28.47]Looking in the mirror
[01:29.73]It's easy to say
[01:31.51]C'mon lead me on
[01:32.98]
[01:35.56]The choices of a lifetime
[01:37.10]In the dreams of a day
[01:39.05]When the coast is gettin' clearer
[01:40.76]I hear you say
[01:42.11]Lead me on
[01:44.10]
[01:47.00]A matter out of time
[01:48.95]In the look on your face
[01:53.79]Caught up in the patterns
[01:55.20]In the light of a life
[01:56.13]Walk across the bridge
[01:59.05]To the shadows of the night
[02:00.49](Chorus)
[02:22.30]Talk to me of lightning --
[02:25.05]I'll hear what you say, my love
[02:28.87]Reaching for the meaning all of the way
[02:35.18]I can keep believing in you and me, my love
[02:43.79]Finding the answers that we need --
[02:47.72]sometimes it's meant to be
[02:56.77]Turn around to see you
[02:59.80]In a crowded place
[03:01.87]I watch for the emotions
[03:03.69]As they cross your face
[03:05.09]Saying lead me on
[03:08.09]I see you in a dream
[03:09.55]And a memory
[03:10.63]A captive of the light
[03:14.14]You say to me
[03:15.73]Lead me on
