[00:11.01]Must Get Out
[00:11.31]I've been the needle and the thread
[00:14.51]Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
[00:21.37]I try to laugh but cry instead
[00:24.37]Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said
[00:30.50]Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for
[00:35.31]Try to guide me in the right direction
[00:40.12]Making use of all this time
[00:42.53]Keeping everything inside
[00:44.97]Close my eyes and listen to you cry
[00:50.94]I'm lifting you up
[00:53.59]I'm letting you down
[00:56.14]I'm dancing til dawn
[00:58.10]I'm fooling around
[01:00.76]I'm not giving up
[01:03.32]I'm making your love
[01:05.77]This city's made us crazy and we must get out
[01:20.61]This not goodbye she said
[01:23.92]It is just time for me to rest my head
[01:30.03]She does not walk she runs instead
[01:33.74]Down these jagged streets and into my bed
[01:39.69]Fumbling through your dresser door forgot what I was looking for
[01:44.55]Try to guide me in the right direction
[01:49.36]Making use of all this time
[01:51.87]Keeping everything inside
[01:54.22]Close my eyes and listen to you cry
[02:00.24]I'm lifting you up
[02:02.70]I'm letting you down
[02:04.95]I'm dancing til dawn
[02:07.11]I'm fooling around
[02:10.06]I'm not giving up
[02:12.62]I'm making your love
[02:14.93]This city's made us crazy and we must get out
[02:20.34]There's only so much I can do for you
[02:29.96]After all of the things you put me through
[02:39.14]
