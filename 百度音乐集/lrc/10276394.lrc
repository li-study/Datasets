[00:00.00]Moonlight Kiss-Bap Kennedy
[00:05.99]缘分天注定剧中插曲
[00:07.32]送给我最爱的人－昕
[00:08.70]BY。捷
[00:10.55]I can feel my heart
[00:14.00]And it's fit to burst
[00:18.16]I try to clean it up
[00:21.91]But I just get worse
[00:26.00]Wish I could fall
[00:29.67]On a night like this
[00:33.94]Into your lovin' arms
[00:37.83]For a moonlight kiss
[00:41.43]I thought I saw your face
[00:45.59]In the evenin' sky
[00:49.49]On a lonesome cloud
[00:54.02]That was driftin' by
[00:56.78]I wish I could fall
[01:00.90]On a night like this
[01:04.72]Into your lovin' arms
[01:08.60]For a moonlight kiss
[01:43.66]You got someone else
[01:47.56]Maybe it's for the best
[01:51.36]Since I took the cure
[01:55.33]For happiness
[01:58.89]And I'd trade it all
[02:03.01]On a night like this
[02:07.65]For your lovin' arms
[02:10.99]And a moonlight kiss
[02:14.89]For your lovin' arms
[02:18.27]And a moonlight kiss
[02:30.51]Lovin' arms
[02:34.27]And a moonlight kiss
[02:38.80]Ooh, yeah
