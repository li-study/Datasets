[00:03.36].
[00:05.93]
[00:07.24].
[00:12.51]Ain''t it just like one of us to pick up the phone
[00:16.57]and call after a couple of drinks,
[00:23.38]And say: "How you been? I been wonderin''
[00:26.19]that maybe you''ve been thinkin'' ''bout me."
[00:34.25]And somewhere in the conversation,
[00:36.94]an old familiar invitation always arrives,
[00:44.94]An'' I may hate myself in the morning,
[00:48.88]but I''m gonna love you tonight.
[00:52.57].
[00:56.56]Everyone''s known someone
[00:59.01]that they just can''t help but want;
[01:07.57]And even though we just can''t make it work out,
[01:11.13]well the want-to lingers on.
[01:18.26]So once again we wind up in each other''s arms,
[01:22.69]pretending that it''s right,
[01:28.94]An'' I may hate myself in the morning,
[01:31.88]but I''m gonna love you tonight.
[01:37.00].
[01:39.63]I know it''s wrong,
[01:42.82]but it ain''t easy moving on.
[01:50.32]So why can''t two friends remember
[01:57.13]the good times once again?
[02:01.44].
[02:03.63]Instrumental break.
[02:22.00].
[02:24.88]Tomorrow when I wake up,
[02:26.94]I''ll be feeling a little guilty, an'' a little sad,
[02:35.88]Thinkin'' how it used to be before
[02:39.07]everything went bad.
[02:45.56]An'' I guess that''s what it is,
[02:48.75]in lonely late night calls like this,
[02:51.75]that we try to find;
[02:57.19]An'' I may hate myself in the morning,
[03:01.13]but I''m gonna love you tonight.
[03:05.38].
[03:08.13]I may hate myself in the morning, but I''m gonna love you tonight
[03:16.88].
