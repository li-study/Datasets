[00:21.01]When the waves are crashing down
[00:26.17]Pulling you to sorrow
[00:31.47]I will sail you back to shore
[00:36.33]When there are no more heroes
[00:41.09]
[00:42.17]Over under, near or far
[00:47.39]I’ll be right beside you
[00:52.52]Standing here with open arms
[00:57.60]When there are no more heroes
[01:02.41]
[01:02.81]And through it all
[01:05.92]And through it all
[01:09.83]When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
[01:16.70]When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
[01:24.71]You’ll never be alone
[01:27.98]When there are no more heroes
[01:32.22]
[01:37.33]It was you who showed me how
[01:42.44]Brought me back to glory
[01:47.39]Through hopelessness and darkest days
[01:52.82]It was breath you gave me
[01:56.81]
[01:57.22]And through it all
[01:59.58]And through it all
[02:03.56]When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
[02:10.29]When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
[02:17.88]You’ll never be alone
[02:21.40]When there are no more heroes
[02:25.57]
[02:43.99]And through it all
[02:46.86]And through it all
[02:50.21]When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
[02:57.49]When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
[03:05.03]You’ll never be alone
[03:08.64]You’ll never be alone
[03:14.02]
[03:14.31]And through it all
[03:15.96]And through it all
[03:18.53]When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
[03:25.61]When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
[03:33.19]You’ll never be alone
[03:37.26]When there are no more heroes
[03:43.58]
[03:45.86]When there are no more heroes
