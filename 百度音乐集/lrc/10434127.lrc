[00:12.64]Who Is It
[00:13.44]Michael Jackson
[00:14.18]
[00:58.44]I gave her money
[01:00.61]I gave her time
[01:02.98]I gave her everything
[01:05.31]Inside one heart could find
[01:07.35]I gave her passion
[01:09.58]My very soul
[01:12.29]I gave her promises
[01:14.79]And secrets so untold
[01:16.70]And she promised me forever
[01:18.72]And a day we'd live as one
[01:21.15]We made our vows We'd live a life anew
[01:25.92]And she promised me in secret
[01:28.10]That she'd love me for all the time
[01:30.42]It's a promise so untrue
[01:32.85]Tell me what will I do ?
[01:34.97]And it doesn't seem to matter
[01:37.29]And it doesn't seem right
[01:39.84]'Cause the will has brought No fortune
[01:42.03]Still I cry alone at night
[01:44.26]Don't you judge of my composure
[01:46.57]'Cause I'm lying to myself
[01:49.02]And the reason why she left me
[01:51.41]Did she find someone else ?
[01:53.59](Who is it ?)
[01:54.68]It is a friend of mine
[01:57.98](Who is it ?)
[01:59.24]Is it my brother ?
[02:02.13](Who is it ?)
[02:04.05]Somebody hurt my soul
[02:07.15](Who is it ?)
[02:08.70]I can't take this stuff no more
[02:12.49]I am the damned
[02:14.94]I am the dead
[02:17.49]I am the agony inside
[02:20.75]The dying head
[02:22.44]This is injustice
[02:24.55]Woe unto thee
[02:26.38]I pray this punishment
[02:29.12]Would have mercy on me
[02:31.16]And she promised me forever
[02:32.78]That we'd live our life as one
[02:34.93]We made our vows
[02:36.00]We'd live a love so true
[02:40.57]It seems that she has left me
[02:42.27]For such reasons unexplained
[02:44.78]I need to find the truth
[02:47.21]But see what will I do ?

[02:58.56]Don't you judge of my composure
[03:01.15]'Cause I'm bothered everyday
[03:03.18]And she didn't leave a letter
[03:05.69]She just up and ran away
