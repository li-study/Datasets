[00:35.05]Inside the doors are sealed to love
[00:37.98]Inside my heart is sleeping
[00:40.80]Inside the fingers of my glove
[00:43.74]Inside the bones of my right hand
[00:46.71]Inside it′s colder than the stars
[00:49.43]Inside the dogs are weeping
[00:52.16]Inside the circus of the wind
[00:55.01]Inside the clocks are filled with sand
[00:58.16]Inside she′ll never hurt me
[01:00.71]Inside the winter′s creeping
[01:03.80]Inside the compass of the night
[01:06.49]Inside the folding of the land
[01:09.54]Outside the stars are turning
[01:12.11]Outside the world′s still burning
[01:20.82]Inside my head′s a box of stars I never dared to open
[01:26.47]Inside the wounded hide their scars,
[01:28.95]inside this lonesome sparrow′s fall
[01:32.25]Inside the songs of our defeat,
[01:35.06]they sing of treaties broken
[01:37.49]Inside this army′s in retreat,
[01:40.51]we hide beneath the thunder′s call
[01:43.37]Outside the rain keeps falling
[01:46.41]Outside the drums are calling
[01:48.91]Outside the flood won′t wait
[01:51.86]Outside they′re hammering down the gate
[01:54.71]Love is the child of an endless war
[01:57.63]Love is an open wound still raw
[02:00.35]Love is a shameless banner unfurled
[02:02.91]Love′s an explosion,
[02:04.14]Love is the fire of the world
[02:05.87]Love is a violent star
[02:07.26]A tide of destruction
[02:08.92]Love is an angry scar
[02:10.31]A violation, a mutilation, capitulation,
[02:13.59]love is annihilation.
[02:17.84]Inside the failures of the light,
[02:20.19]the night is wrapped around me
[02:23.33]Inside my eyes deny their sight,
[02:26.13]you′d never find me in this place
[02:29.24]Inside we′re hidden from the moonlight,
[02:31.88]we shift between the shadows
[02:34.90]Inside the compass of the night,
[02:37.49]inside the memory of your face
[02:40.69]Outside the walls are shaking
[02:43.39]Inside the dogs are waking
[02:46.26]Outside the hurricane won′t wait
[02:48.90]Inside they′re howling down the gate
[02:51.72]Love is the child of an endless war
[02:54.64]Love is an open wound still raw
[02:57.30]Love is a shameless banner unfurled
[02:59.66]Love′s an explosion,
[03:01.11]Love is the fire at the end of the world
[03:03.45]Love is a violent star
[03:04.78]A tide of destruction
[03:06.26]Love is an angry scar
[03:07.79]The pain of instruction
[03:09.27]Love is a violation, a mutilation, capitulation,
[03:13.31]Love is annihilation.
[03:17.23]I climb this tower inside my head
[03:22.53]A spiral stair above my bed
[03:28.34]I dream the stairs don′t ask me why,
[03:34.03]I throw myself into the sky
[03:40.00]Love me like a baby, love me like an only child
[03:42.71]Love me like an ocean; love me like a mother mild
[03:45.61]Love me like a father, love me like a prodigal son
[03:48.54]Love me like a sister,
[03:49.71]love me like the world has just begun
[03:51.44]Love me like a prodigy, love me like an idiot boy,
[03:54.14]Love me like an innocent,
[03:55.38]love me like your favorite toy
[03:56.99]Love me like a virgin, love me like a courtesan,
[03:59.71]Love me like a sinner, love me like a dying man.
[04:02.74]Annihilate me, infiltrate me, incinerate me,
[04:06.13]accelerate me, mutilate me, inundate me, violate me,
[04:09.88]implicate me, vindicate me, devastate me
[04:14.30]Love me like a parasite, love me like a dying sun
[04:17.13]Love me like a criminal, love me like a man on the run
[04:20.12]Radiate me, subjugate me, incubate me, recreate me,
[04:23.91]demarcate me, educate me, punctuate me, evaluate me,
[04:28.57]conjugate me, impregnate me, designate me, humiliate me,
[04:32.90]segregate me, opiate me, calibrate me, replicate me
