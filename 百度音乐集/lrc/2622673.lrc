[00:25.00]
[00:44.36]Once again I'm falling to my knees.
[00:51.29]I try to escape cause I just can't take it.
[00:53.42]Now this feeling is spreading like a disease.
[00:59.43]I fake another day and the wheel keeps turning.
[01:01.50]
[01:01.77]This place is so pathetic.
[01:03.57]Doesn't anybody get it.
[01:05.64]Is there anybody home?
[01:07.82]
[01:10.04]There's nothing left.
[01:12.37]We're just a shadow of what we used to be.
[01:18.87]
[01:19.23]In the night there's a fire in my eyes.
[01:27.06]And this paradise has become a place we've come to cry.
[01:36.08]When I open your letter, the words make it better.
[01:40.58]It takes it all away.
[01:44.31]
[01:51.63]It keeps me holding on.
[01:54.80]
[02:00.65]It keeps me holding on.
[02:03.34]
[02:11.80]Here we are, pretending we're ok.
[02:18.41]You can say what you want but you still can't fool me.
[02:20.58]The life we're living, it's all a masquerade.
[02:27.63]I try to smile but I can't remember how.
[02:29.79]
[02:29.98]So how did we get so jaded.
[02:31.89]Is it so complicated.
[02:33.93]To not give up on me?
[02:37.51]
[02:39.18]In the night there's a fire in my eyes.
[02:46.23]And this paradise has become a place we've come to cry.
[02:55.06]When I open your letter, the words make it better.
[02:59.54]It takes it all away.
[03:03.19]
[03:10.70]It keeps me holding on.
[03:13.04]
[03:13.21]Whenever I need you.
[03:15.00]Wherever I run to.
[03:17.12]I know where to find you.
[03:19.39]It keeps me holding on.
[03:21.83]
[03:22.03]Whenever I need you.
[03:23.65]Wherever I run to.
[03:25.83]I know where to find you.
[03:27.56]
[03:36.80]It keeps me holding on.
[03:43.68]
[03:44.17]It keeps me holding on.
[03:55.58]
[03:56.30]In the night there's a fire in my eyes.
[04:04.58]And this paradise has become a place we've come to cry.
[04:13.38]When I open your letter, the words make it better.
[04:18.45]It takes it all away.
[04:22.80]
[04:29.39]It keeps me holding on.
[04:33.49]
[04:38.25]It keeps me holding on.
[04:41.25]
[04:46.98]It keeps me holding on.
