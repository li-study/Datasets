[00:11.35]This is a man\'s world
[00:16.79]This is a man\'s world
[00:22.90]But it would be nothing
[00:25.59]Nothing without a woman or a girl
[00:37.18]You see man made the cars
[00:43.62]To take us over the road
[00:48.29]Man made the train
[00:53.55]To carry the heavy load
[00:58.24]Man made the electric lights
[01:01.57]To take us out of the dark
[01:07.02]Man made the boat for the water
[01:11.41]Like Noah made the ark
[01:13.86]This is a man\'s man\'s, man\'s world
[01:19.00]But it would be nothing
[01:20.87]Nothing without a woman or a girl
[01:33.38]Man thinks of little baby girls And the baby boys
[01:42.68]Man make them happy \'Cause man makes them toys
[01:51.47]And after man make everything, everything he can
[01:58.06]You know that man makes money to buy from other man
[02:07.37]This is a man\'s world
[02:11.35]But it would be nothing, nothing

[02:15.62]Without a woman or a girl
[02:24.13]He\'s lost in the wilderness
[02:31.89]He\'s lost in the bitterness
[02:40.98]He\'s lost, lost and .....
