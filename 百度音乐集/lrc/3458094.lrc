[00:04.84]Saosin-Sleepers
[00:11.58]英文歌词第一站
[00:13.65]
[00:21.17]We have been in tune with luck
[00:24.64]We slept through it
[00:26.92]Taking hits off the surface (surface)
[00:31.34]Its too hard to swallow it
[00:34.52]The judgement is concentrating
[00:39.24]On everything below.
[00:42.31](Was it long enough
[00:46.52]or did he wake you up from your sleeping?)
[00:54.00]I've overheard it once
[00:56.96]This has gone on before
[00:59.62]It's still one in the same
[01:02.23](We are accounted for)
[01:04.72]We seem so far away from
[01:07.39]These things we used to know
[01:10.06]We seem so far away from everything
[01:20.30]Everyone that moves around me
[01:25.00]They're saying nothing
[01:27.99]That makes the fire glow
[01:31.02]Savor something that no one needs to know
[01:37.66]They all think everything is gold
[01:42.67](Was it long enough
[01:47.39]or did he wake you up from your sleeping?)
[01:54.99]I've overheard it once
[01:57.83]This has gone on before
[02:00.52]It's still one in the same
[02:03.03](We are accounted for)
[02:05.89]We seem so far away from
[02:08.21]These things we used to know
[02:10.94]We seem so far away from everything
[02:21.18]All we are is golden (golden)
[02:28.58]This won't mean a thing
[02:31.15]All we know is golden (golden)
[02:39.04]This won't mean a thing
