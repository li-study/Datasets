[ti:It's in the Rain]

[00:21.15]Every time, the rain comes down
[00:28.61]Close my eyes and listen
[00:33.52]I can hear the lonesome sound
[00:42.08]All the sky, as it cries
[00:49.61]Listen to the rain!
[00:59.27]Here it comes again!
[01:04.19]Hear it in the rain!
[01:12.19]Feel the touch of tears that fall
[01:20.39]They won't fall forever
[01:26.13]In the way, the day will flow
[01:34.51]All things come, all things gone
[01:42.36]Listen to the rain!
[01:51.79]Here it comes again!
[01:58.89]Hear it in the rain!
[02:06.31]Late at night, I drift away
[02:13.18]I can hear you calling
[02:18.57]And my name is in the rain
[02:27.02]Leaves on trees, whispering
[02:34.37]Deep blue seas, mystery
[03:11.46]Even when this moment ends
[03:17.75]Can't let go this feeling
[03:22.73]Every day will come again in the sound falling down
[03:40.27]Off the sky, as it cries
[03:46.74]Hear my name in the rain
