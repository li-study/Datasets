[00:12.87]When you look back on times we had
[00:18.88]I hope you smile
[00:22.90]And know that through the good and through the bad
[00:27.55]I was on your side when nobody could hold us down
[00:31.47]We claimed the brightest star
[00:34.10]And we, we came so far
[00:37.18]And no they won't forget
[00:43.15]Whenever you remember times gone by
[00:48.40]Remember how we held our heads so high
[00:51.65]When all this world was there for us
[00:55.08]And we believe that we could touch the sky
[00:59.04]Whenever you remember, I'll be there
[01:03.07]Remember how we reached that dream together
[01:09.00]Whenever you remember
[01:15.15]When you think back on all we've done
[01:21.01]I hope you're proud
[01:22.36]When you look back and see how far we've come
[01:28.02]It was our time to shine
[01:30.12]And nobody could hold us down
[01:33.72]They thought they'd see us fall
[01:35.81]But we, we stood so tall
[01:39.13]And no we won't forget
[01:44.62]Whenever you remember times gone by
[01:48.86]Remember how we held our heads so high
[01:52.93]When all this world was there for us
[01:55.79]And we believe that we could touch the sky
[02:00.81]Whenever you remember, I'll be there
[02:04.84]Remember how we reached that dream together
[02:10.60]Whenever you remember
[02:17.68]Yeahhh, Ooohh
[02:28.65]We claimed the brightest star
[02:31.70]And we, we came so far
[02:36.86]And know that we showed them all
[02:39.89]And no they won't forget
[02:43.81]Yeahhh
[02:46.73]Whenever you remember times gone by
[02:50.97]Remember how we held our heads so high
[02:55.71]When all this world was there for us
[02:57.95]And we believe that we could touch the sky
[03:02.78]Whenever you remember, I'll be there
[03:08.17]Remember how we reached that dream together
