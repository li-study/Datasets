[00:19.74]I'll be the roundabout
[00:22.86]The words will make you out 'n' out
[00:27.26]I spend the day your way
[00:32.22]Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley
[00:39.04]
[00:47.80]The music dance and sing

[01:06.29]
[01:07.14]In and around the lake
[01:10.73]Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
[01:17.91]One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
[01:24.27]Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
[01:30.71]Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you
[01:37.55]
[01:44.76]I will remember you
[01:48.89]Your silhouette will charge the view
[01:52.24]Of distance atmosphere
[01:57.04]Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley
[02:02.59]
[02:03.93]In and around the lake
[02:07.52]Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

[02:21.34]Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
[02:27.72]Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you
[02:34.16]
