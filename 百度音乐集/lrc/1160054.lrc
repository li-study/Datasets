[00:-0.50]Nightwish - The Islander

[00:54.40]---------
[00:56.40]
[00:58.40]An old man by a seashore
[01:00.50]At the end of day
[01:02.65]Gazes the horizon
[01:04.38]With seawinds in his face
[01:06.94]Tempest-tossed island
[01:09.03]Seasons all the same
[01:11.13]Anchorage unpainted
[01:13.00]And a ship without a name
[01:17.60]
[01:18.73]Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
[01:22.98]He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
[01:27.23]Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
[01:31.54]The ones on their travels homeward from afar
[01:37.16]
[01:38.29]This is for long-forgotten
[01:43.26]Light at the end of the world
[01:47.42]Horizon crying
[01:51.85]The tears he left behind long ago
[01:56.48]
[02:13.33]The albatross is flying
[02:15.27]Making him daydream
[02:17.61]The time before he became
[02:19.74]One of the world's unseen
[02:21.90]Princess in the tower
[02:24.02]Children in the fields
[02:26.17]Life gave him it all:
[02:27.77]An island of the universe
[02:31.74]
[02:33.74]Now his love's a memory
[02:35.77]A ghost in the fog
[02:37.96]He sets the sails one last time
[02:39.64]Saying farewell to the world
[02:42.30]Anchor to the water
[02:44.37]Seabed far below
[02:46.52]Grass still in his feet
[02:48.33]And a smile beneath his brow
[02:52.37]
[02:53.18]This is for long-forgotten
[02:58.37]Light at the end of the world
[03:02.46]Horizon crying
[03:06.87]The tears he left behind so long ago
[03:11.81]
[03:53.01]This is for long-forgotten
[03:58.35]Light at the end of the world
[04:02.32]Horizon crying
[04:06.85]The tears he left behind so long ago
[04:11.39]
