[00:05.52]
[00:13.65]Tall and tan and young and lovely
[00:16.32]The girl from Ipanema goes walking
[00:19.58]And when she passes each one she passes goes ah
[00:26.04]When she walks she's like a samba that
[00:29.08]Swings so cool and sway so gently
[00:32.54]That when she passes each one she passes goes ah
[00:38.81]Oh  But I watch her so sadly
[00:45.15]How can I tell her he loves her?

[00:57.38]But each day when she walks to the sea
[01:00.72]She looks straight ahead not at him
[01:04.23]Tall and tan and young and lovely
