[00:02.00]On The Wing
[00:05.00]Owl City  
[00:08.00]
[00:37.69]Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
[00:43.58]And we'll stir the stars around
[00:46.76]And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
[00:52.04]And plummet out of sight and sound
[00:54.85]
[00:55.27]The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
[01:00.31]Where I live in the alpine heights
[01:03.57]Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
[01:08.70]Alone, awake and thinking of...
[01:11.35]the weekend we were in love
[01:13.65]
[01:29.82]Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
[01:35.78]A thousand miles from the tide
[01:38.86]But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
[01:44.13]Distract me so I stay inside
[01:47.08]
[01:47.43]I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
[01:52.56]Cuz I would make a hook and eye
[01:55.56]And fish them from the sky, 
[01:58.23]my darling, she and I
[02:00.84]We're hanging on so take us high
[02:03.45]To sing the world goodbye:
[02:05.37]
[02:05.74]I am floating away
[02:09.41]Lost in a silent ballet
[02:13.11]I'm dreaming you're out in the blue 
[02:16.03]and I am right beside you
[02:18.01]Awake to take in the view
[02:22.00]Late nights and early parades
[02:25.41]Still photos and noisy arcades
[02:29.37]My darling, we're both on the wing, 
[02:32.74]look down and keep on singing!
[02:34.92]And we can go anywhere
[02:37.67]Are you there'......
[02:42.29]Are you there, 
[02:44.67]or are you just a decoy dream in my head'
[02:51.20]Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone'
[02:58.84]
[03:45.92]I am floating away
[03:49.68]Lost in a silent ballet
[03:53.28]I'm dreaming you're out in the blue 
[03:56.15]and I am right beside you
[03:58.10]Awake to take in the view
[04:02.19]Late nights and early parades
[04:05.70]Still photos and noisy arcades
[04:09.93]My darling, we're both on the wing, 
[04:12.94]look down and keep on singing!
[04:14.96]And we can go anywhere
[04:18.08]Are you there'
[04:22.36]Are you there'
[04:24.37]
