[00:08.55]Just found joy
[00:12.49]I'm as happy as a baby boy, baby boy
[00:17.83]With another brand new choo-choo choy
[00:22.17]When I met my sweet Lorraine, Lorraine, Lorraine.
[00:28.00]
[00:28.98]A pair of eyes
[00:33.56]That are brighter tham the summer sky
[00:37.13]When you see them, you'll realize
[00:43.48]Why I love my sweet Lorraine.
[00:48.26]
[00:50.61]Now when it's rainin',
[00:53.49]I don't miss the sun
[00:56.14]Because it's in my baby's smile, whoa ho.
[01:02.75]And to think that I'm the lucky one
[01:07.26]That will lead her down the aisle, whoa ho ho.
[01:13.51]
[01:14.71]Each night I pray
[01:16.35]That no one will steal her heart away,
[01:21.82]I can't wait until that lucky day
[01:26.72]When I marry sweet Lorraine.
