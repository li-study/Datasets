[00:13.50]When they poured across the border
[00:16.50]I was cautioned to surrender,
[00:19.50]this I could not do;
[00:23.50]I took my gun and vanished.
[00:27.50]
[00:35.50]I have changed my name so often,
[00:37.50]I've lost my wife and children
[00:41.50]but I have many friends,
[00:45.50]and some of them are with me.
[00:49.50]
[00:53.50]An old woman gave us shelter,
[00:56.50]kept us hidden in the garret,
[00:59.50]then the soldiers came;
[01:03.50]she died without a whisper.
[01:07.50]
[01:12.50]There were three of us this morning
[01:15.50]I'm the only one this evening
[01:17.50]but I must go on;
[01:22.50]the frontiers are my prison.
[01:26.50]
[01:33.50]Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
[01:37.50]through the graves the wind is blowing,
[01:39.50]freedom soon will come;
[01:44.50]then we'll come from the shadows.

[01:55.50]Les Allemands e'taient chez moi,
[01:57.50]ils me dirent, "Signe toi,"
[02:00.50]mais je n'ai pas peur;
[02:05.50]j'ai repris mon arme.
[02:12.50]
[02:16.50]J'ai change' cent fois de nom,
[02:19.50]j'ai perdu femme et enfants
[02:22.50]mais j'ai tant d'amis;
[02:27.50]j'ai la France entié‘¢e.
[02:33.50]
[02:38.50]Un vieil homme dans un grenier
[02:41.50]pour la nuit nous a cache',
[02:43.50]les Allemands l'ont pris;
[02:48.50]il est mort sans surprise.
[02:56.50]
[02:59.50]Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
[03:02.50]through the graves the wind is blowing,
[03:05.50]freedom soon will come;
[03:10.50]then we'll come from the shadows.
