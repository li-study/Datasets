[00:00.00]Prefab Sprout - I Love Music
[00:00.70]
[00:02.08]I love music, in every style
[00:08.99]from Clair de lune,
[00:12.05]to that mother...'cker Miles.
[00:14.77]I love music, I love music,
[00:19.72]the things she says.
[00:23.26]I have to hang on,
[00:26.42]her every enigmatic phrase.
[00:29.52]She's richer than money,
[00:31.11]and bigger than fame,
[00:33.18]and love is the reason
[00:34.84]I'm playing this game.
[00:36.67]She's richer than money,
[00:38.36]and bigger than fame,
[00:40.40]and love is the reason
[00:41.93]I'm playing this game...
[00:43.54]I love music, I love music,
[00:48.28]she holds the keys
[00:51.90]to unlock heartaches,
[00:55.32]and silver stardust memories.
[00:57.81]When that sweet angel sings
[01:01.10]I believe that
[01:03.84]I have wings too
[01:06.96]I believe that
[01:09.19]I have wings too
[01:12.14]I beli-ee-eve I have wings
[01:17.28]I love music, she knows how
[01:24.50]to bring the past into the here and now.
[01:30.72]The song that was playing,
[01:32.61]the night that you fell,
[01:34.35]for someone from heaven,
[01:36.25]who put you through hell,
[01:38.03]The song that was playing,
[01:39.72]will help you recall
[01:41.57]the feeling of falling,
[01:43.32]the thrill of it all...
[01:44.84]I hate music.
[01:47.12]
[01:58.84]When that sweet angel sings
[02:02.26]I believe that
[02:05.00]I have wings too
[02:07.77]I believe that
[02:10.31]I have wings too
[02:13.28]I beli-ee-eve I have wings
[02:18.71]I love music, and when I die
[02:25.43]I'll tell Saint Peter,
[02:28.08]if he's the one asks me why:
[02:31.66]She's richer than money,
[02:33.50]and bigger than fame,
[02:35.18]and love is the reason
[02:37.01]I played in the game
[02:38.72]She's richer than money,
[02:40.47]and bigger than fame,
[02:42.39]and love is the reason
[02:44.01]I played in the game...
[02:45.94]The song that was playing,
[02:47.68]the night that you fell,
[02:49.39]for someone from heaven,
[02:51.32]who put you through hell,
[02:52.97]The song that was playing,
[02:54.75]will help you recall
[02:56.48]the feeling of falling,
[02:58.48]the thrill of it all...
[02:59.84]I love music, I love music,
[03:04.28]she's my heroine.
[03:08.84]Who's my hero?
[03:11.12]The unnerving, unswerving Irving Berlin!
[03:14.92]Richer than money,
[03:16.82]and bigger than fame,
[03:18.71]and love is the reason
[03:20.39]I'm playing this game
[03:22.22]Richer than money,
[03:23.78]and bigger than fame,
[03:25.95]love is the reason
[03:27.45]I'm playing this game...
[03:29.16]I love music, Nile and 'Nard,
[03:37.64]Pierre Boulez,
[03:40.82]guru of the avant-garde.
