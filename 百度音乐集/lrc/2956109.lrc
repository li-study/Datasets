[00:11.07]One has to come to terms with one’s own mortality.
[00:14.75]And you can't really help people who are having problems with mortality,
[00:19.25]if you've got problems of your own.
[00:22.06]So you have to begin to sort things out,
[00:25.61]and I thought I had sorted things out until I saw this excerpt from this book
[00:30.67], of certainty I shall remember what it said:
[00:34.41]“Life is not the opposite of death. Death is the opposite of birth. Life is eternal.”
[00:40.34]And I thought that it’s the most profound words I have ever heard about that
[00:46.58]issue and it really put me in peace.
[00:55.69][I felt it was a wonderful story.] And that’s it. What else is there to say? Heh.
[01:02.93]Life is eternal. Surely the opposite of life is not death, but life is eternal.
[01:08.92]There is no opposite.
[01:10.73]And so, what happens is, I suppose, [and isn’t this a raging (or outrageous)]
[01:18.40]state of pure consciousness, stillness and silence?
[01:23.77]Yeah, what we are looking for now,
[01:25.27]we are searching for and we have been searching for,
[01:27.70]now we've become closer to it and now we know it's already there,
[01:35.31]is there for ever to seek, it’s there, and it's going be there, all the time,
[01:40.99]forevermore.
