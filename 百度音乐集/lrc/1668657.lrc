[00:14.94]Wake up maggie I think I got something to say to you
[00:22.44]It’s late september and I really should be back at school
[00:29.74]I know I keep you amused but I feel I’m being used
[00:36.28]Oh maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
[00:44.74]You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
[00:52.23]You stole my heart and that’s what really hurt
[00:57.73]
[00:59.65]The morning sun when it’s in your face really shows your age
[01:06.64]But that don’t worry me none in my eyes you’re everything
[01:14.65]I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn’t need to coax
[01:21.52]Oh, maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
[01:29.52]You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
[01:36.74]You stole my soul and that’s a pain I can do without
[01:42.45]
[01:44.21]All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
[01:51.22]But you turned into a lover and
[01:54.63]Mother what a lover, you wore me out
[01:59.26]All you did was wreck my bed
[02:02.93]And in the morning kick me in the head
[02:06.79]Oh maggie I couldn’t have tried anymore
[02:13.95]You lured me away from home ’cause you didn’t want to be alone
[02:21.77]You stole my heart I couldn’t leave you if I tried
[02:26.23]
[02:44.23]I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
[02:51.16]Or steal my daddy’s cue and make a living out of playing pool
[02:58.95]Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin’ hand
[03:06.07]Oh maggie I wish I’d never seen your face
[03:13.23]You made a first-class fool out of me
[03:17.39]But I’m as blind as a fool can be
[03:21.76]You stole my heart but I love you anyway
[03:26.06]
[04:32.14]Maggie I wish I’d never seen your face
[04:46.87]I’ll get on back home one of these days
