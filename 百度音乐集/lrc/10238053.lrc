[00:01.00]Murder by Death - White Noise
[00:04.00]
[02:45.01][01:06.36][00:11.59]Meet me in the valley
[02:47.93][01:10.01][00:15.52]See me pass on the street
[02:51.51][01:13.89][00:19.41]You'll find me in the garden
[02:55.68][01:18.13][00:23.40]Trampled flowers 'neath my feet
[00:43.91]The oceans'll seethe
[00:48.99]And have no reprieve
[00:51.16]For the weak
[00:52.13]And the damned
[00:53.51]The creatures of the sea
[00:56.56]Will make homes
[00:57.93]Of the bones
[00:58.94]That drift endlessly
[01:02.76](As far as the eye can see)
[01:23.80]The mountains sink into the earth
[01:27.73]And amidst the crumbling dirt
[01:31.48]The stragglers clutch their young
[01:35.70]As if there's something to be done
[02:31.90][01:45.50]Or will it be just
[02:35.30][01:48.20]Just this
[02:38.05][01:50.35]Just
[02:39.25][01:52.47]White noise, white light in the deep
[02:09.79]Will they record
[02:14.64]The descending of the hoarde
[02:18.07]With a black box that contains
[02:22.17]The echoes, the shouts, the strains
[02:25.95]Of the last
[02:59.55]You've heard the stories of me
[03:03.21]You know what I can do
[03:07.16]I take the ember's of man's anger
[03:10.98]And there's nothing I can't spin them into
[03:15.83]You hear me whisper to you
[03:18.62]I see you recognize my face
[03:22.49]A familiar pulse
[03:26.63]Calling out from the empty spaces
[03:30.96]"Meet me in the valley"
