
[00:08.02]I need to be in love
[00:11.86]Carpenters
[00:13.38]
[00:27.40]The hardest thing I've ever done is keep believing
[00:34.09]There's someone in this crazy world for me
[00:40.14]The way that people come and go through temporary lives
[00:46.80]My chance could come and I might never know
[00:53.29]I used to say \"No promises, let's keep it simple\"
[00:59.93]But freedom only helps you say goodbye
[01:06.28]It took a while for me to learn that nothing comes for free
[01:14.87]The price I paid is high enough for me
[01:21.57]I know I need to be in love
[01:28.04]I know I've wasted too much time
[01:34.45]I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
[01:42.51]And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
[01:51.15]
[01:57.14]So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
[02:02.52]But none of them will comfort me tonight
[02:08.06]I'm wide awake at 4 a.m. without a friend in sight
[02:17.14]I'm hanging on a hope but I'm all right
[02:24.03]I know I need to be in love
[02:30.68]I know I've wasted too much time
[02:37.13]I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
[02:45.55]And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
[02:52.36]I know I need to be in love
[02:59.24]I know I've wasted too much time
[03:05.29]I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
[03:14.39]And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
[03:25.03]
