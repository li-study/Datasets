[00:11.69]Ever ever after...
[00:21.67]Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true
[00:30.23]Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do
[00:39.26]And a secret is taught, it's our favourite part of the story
[00:47.39]Let's just admit we all wanna make it too
[00:54.56]Ever ever after
[00:58.69]If we just don't get it our own way
[01:02.99]Ever ever after
[01:07.36]It may only be a wish away
[01:13.08]Starting your fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve
[01:21.66]Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
[01:30.58]Unafraid, unashamed
[01:34.45]There is joy to be claimed in this world
[01:38.85]You even might wind up being glad to be you
[01:45.86]Ever ever after
[01:49.90]Though the world will tell you it's not smart
[01:54.40]Ever ever after
[01:58.51]The world can be yours if you let your heart
[02:02.82]Believe in ever after
[02:07.28]No wonder your heart feels it's flying
[02:10.64]Your head feels it's spinning
[02:13.11]Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
[02:17.43]Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through
[02:24.40]To ever ever after
[02:28.67]Forever could even start today
[02:32.95]Ever ever after
[02:37.70]Maybe it's just one wish away
[02:41.50]Your ever ever after
[03:01.99](I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss)
[03:10.97]Oh, for ever ever after
