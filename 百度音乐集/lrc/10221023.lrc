[00:09.91][00:25.58][03:54.92][04:13.47]
[00:32.39]I've been away so long I hardly knew the place
[00:34.65]It's been too long since I've been around
[00:37.40]Just like I rolling stone I ain't go no home
[00:40.24]But my boys are back in town
[00:53.63]It's been two long years that I've been on the run
[00:56.58]From lawyers, lovers, monies and a lawman's son
[00:59.48]You though tit was the last you heard from me
[01:01.85]Well you better back up to catch up with me
[01:04.32][01:53.01]'Cause I'm livin' in the fast lane
[01:08.77]Speeding like a steam train
[01:11.40]Just before I fall
[01:12.69]Just before I fall off the track
[01:15.02][01:25.89][02:03.62][02:09.13][02:14.49][03:13.97][03:19.47][03:24.77][03:30.16][03:35.59][03:40.97][03:46.36][03:51.96]Taking it back
[01:20.41]I'm taking it back
[01:31.84][02:20.47]You took it away, took it away
[01:34.70][02:23.26]All I can say is we're taking it back
[01:42.43]I'm the same old dog that I used to be
[01:45.32]The word's all over town that you've been looking for me
[01:47.79]I'm no different that I was before
[01:50.53]Give you what you need and then I'm out the door
[01:57.45]Coming like a hurricane
[01:58.82]A snake without a rattle
[02:00.07]Baby that's a matter of fact
[03:03.88]I've been away so long it's good to see your face
[03:06.56]Barkeep, won't you buy me a round?
[03:09.09]Raise a glass to the good times past
[03:11.57]Then we'll tear this damn place down
[03:55.52]<END>
