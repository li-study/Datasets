[00:00.00]小野麗莎 - Danny Boy

[00:09.69]
[00:29.38]Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
[00:36.53]From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
[00:43.62]The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
[00:50.42]'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
[00:58.92]But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
[01:05.43]Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
[01:13.04]'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
[01:20.64]Oh Danny boy, Danny boy, I love you so.
[01:28.55]
[01:57.33]And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
[02:04.33]And I am dead, as dead I well may be
[02:11.63]You'll come and find the place where I am lying
[02:18.50]And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
[02:26.03]And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
[02:33.24]And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
[02:40.42]If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
[02:47.87]I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
[02:54.84]I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
[03:02.01]I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
