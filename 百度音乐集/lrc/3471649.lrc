[ar:roxette]

[00:17.50]It must have been love
[00:19.50]
[00:22.50]but it's over now.
[00:25.50]
[00:28.50]Lay a whisper
[00:30.50]
[00:31.50]on my pillow,
[00:33.50]
[00:34.50]leave the winter
[00:36.50]
[00:37.50]on the ground.
[00:39.50]
[00:40.50]I wake up lonely,
[00:41.50]
[00:43.50]there's air of silence
[00:45.50]
[00:46.50]in the bedroom
[00:47.50]
[00:49.50]and all around.
[00:50.50]
[00:52.50]Touch me now,
[00:53.50]
[00:54.50]I close my eyes
[00:57.50]
[00:57.50]and dream away.
[00:59.50]
[01:02.50]It must have been love
[01:05.50]
[01:05.50]but it's over now.
[01:08.50]
[01:09.50]It must have been good
[01:11.50]
[01:11.50]but I lost it somehow.
[01:14.50]
[01:15.50]It must have been love
[01:17.50]
[01:18.50]but it's over now.
[01:20.50]
[01:21.50]From the moment we touched
[01:22.50]
[01:23.50]'til the time had run out.
[01:26.50]
[01:27.50]Make-believing
[01:29.50]
[01:30.50]we're together,
[01:32.50]
[01:33.50]that I'm sheltered
[01:35.50]
[01:36.50]by your heart.
[01:38.50]
[01:39.50]But in and outside
[01:41.50]
[01:42.50]I've turned to water
[01:44.50]
[01:45.50]like a teardrop
[01:47.50]
[01:48.50]in your palm
[01:50.50]
[01:51.50]And it's a hard
[01:52.50]
[01:54.50]winter's day,
[01:56.50]
[01:57.50]I dream away.
[02:00.50]
[02:02.50]It must have been love
[02:04.50]
[02:05.50]but it's over now,
[02:07.50]
[02:08.50]it was all that I wanted,
[02:10.50]
[02:11.50]now I'm living without.
[02:13.50]
[02:14.50]It must have been love
[02:16.50]
[02:17.50]but it's over now,
[02:19.50]
[02:20.50]it's where the water flows,
[02:24.50]
[02:26.50]it's where the wind blows.
[02:30.50]
[02:57.50]It must have been love
[02:59.50]
[02:59.50]but it's over now.
[03:01.50]
[03:02.50]It must have been good
[03:04.50]
[03:05.50]but I lost it somehow.
[03:07.50]
[03:08.50]It must have been love
[03:10.50]
[03:11.50]but it's over now.
[03:13.50]
[03:14.50]From the moment we touched
[03:15.50]
[03:17.50]'til the time had run out.
[03:19.50]
[03:20.50]It must have been love
[03:22.50]but it's over now,
[03:25.50]it was all that I wanted,
[03:28.50]now I'm living without.
[03:31.50]
[03:32.50]It must have been love
[03:33.50]
[03:34.50]but it's over now,
[03:37.50]
[03:38.50]it's where the water flows,
[03:41.50]
[03:43.50]it's where the wind blows.
[03:48.50]
[03:51.50]It must have been love
[03:53.50]
[03:55.50]but it's over now,
[03:58.50]
[04:02.50]It must have been love
[04:06.50]
[04:07.50]but it's over now,
[04:10.50]
