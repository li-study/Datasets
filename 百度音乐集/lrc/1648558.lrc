
[00:00.00]Stars
[00:09.00]Tangerines are hanging heavy, glowing marigolden hues
[00:20.00]Teasing a half-pale moon
[00:25.00]And I feel a pull to the blue-velvet dark and stars.
[00:39.50]Pink Magnolia, blushing and coy
[00:44.50]Savors the sun while she shines
[00:50.00]You’ve got yours and I’ve got mine
[00:54.50]Together we glide through the blue-velvet dark and stars
[01:09.50]All it takes is a little faith, and a lot of heart
[01:20.00]Back and forth we ply these oars
[01:24.00]They move in time and get entwined
[01:30.00]Green with joy then gray with sorrow
[01:35.00]Ripened fruit that falls tomorrow
[01:39.50]Filling us with brilliance
[01:54.50]Branches are bare with a pulse underneath
[01:59.00]Flowering slowly inside
[02:04.00]Your hands are warm and my body is wide
[02:09.00]To hold all the promise of blue-velvet dark and stars
[02:25.00]All it takes is a little faith and a lot of heart
[02:33.50]Sweetheart
