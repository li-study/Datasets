[00:16.04]You come to me with a casual flow
[00:22.90]And suddenly, my defences start to go
[00:29.90]When you talk to me in that sensual tone
[00:36.50]It envelops me and I lose my self control
[00:43.08]And baby, I just melt away
[00:47.44]Fall like rain
[00:50.04]Everytime I see your face, I go off
[00:56.87]I just want to break it down
[01:00.26]Anytime you come around
[01:03.68]Maybe I could melt away in your arms
[01:11.49]Imagining that your taking it slow
[01:18.17]And so tenderly
[01:20.35](So tenderly)
[01:21.70]Till the feeling overflows
[01:25.19]When you look at me I go soft and cave in
[01:32.12]And I can’t conceal that I’m slowly weakening
[01:38.52]And baby, I just melt away
[01:42.98]Fall like rain
[01:45.45]Everytime I see your face, I go off
[01:52.33]I just want to break it down
[01:55.83]Anytime you come around
[01:59.27]Maybe I could melt away in your arms
[02:07.27]You and me in a cloud of reverie
[02:13.74]Spin around inside my head unendingly
[02:18.73](Over and over and over and over)
[02:22.20]Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
[02:28.76]Pretty pictures of what I’d do if you were mine
[02:38.23]And baby, I just melt away
[02:42.98]Fall like rain
[02:45.41]Everytime I see your face, I go off
[02:52.52]I just want to break it down
[02:55.93]Anytime you come around
[02:59.27]Maybe I could melt away in your arms
[03:06.93]And baby, I just melt away
[03:10.53]Fall like rain
[03:13.27]Everytime I see your face, I go off
[03:20.18]I just want to break it down
[03:23.71]Anytime you come around
[03:27.07]Maybe I could melt away in your arms
