[00:00.83]I'm standing on the edge
[00:04.93]And coming to my senses from my reverie
[00:12.15]Never thought I would
[00:15.58]Never thought I need you
[00:19.89]"Say goodbye" I bid you farewell
[00:26.67]My voiceless words are swaying in the flame
[00:36.79]I can't live without...
[00:40.19]I can't live without...
[00:43.89]I can't live without you
[00:47.42]Here in the dark
[00:50.30]I whisper your name over again
[00:57.79]Give me the strength to seize the light
[01:04.44]If I should find a way
[01:08.50]I saw a dream you were flying in the sky
[01:16.27]Without a fear
[01:19.00]Never touched the ground
[01:22.46]But never came to my side
[01:26.42]I tried so hard to reach out for your hand
[01:33.90]The ruthless wind kept your soul away
[01:43.63]I can't live without...
[01:47.08]I can't give without...
[01:50.70]I can't breathe without you
[01:54.15]Here in the world
[01:57.68]Do you feel the rain?
[02:00.88]You said love takes you pain
[02:05.06]With or without the sun
[02:08.98]The lurid sky still tearing me apart
[02:29.61]
[02:32.61]We should let freedom rain over the pain
[02:40.35]Give me the strength to believe the words that "love will find a way"
[02:50.95]I can't live without...
[02:54.43]I can't give without you
[02:58.00]Here in the world
[03:01.37]Do you feel the rain over the pain?
[03:08.49]Give me the strength to believe the words that "love will find a way"
[03:22.54]With or without the sun
[03:26.94]I'll be and I won't say goodbye
[03:33.97]Cause I...
[03:36.78]I know I'll be with you
[03:49.39].
[03:51.17].
[03:54.16].
[03:58.35].
