[00:01.00]Jake Owen - Tell Me
[00:02.00]
[01:13.37]She said she loved me, all night long
[01:19.94]I couldn't help but let her string my heart along
[01:25.96]I knew better, I still do
[01:31.71]But I'm not the first man who's ever played the fool
[01:36.66]
[01:37.72]So tell me, why do I keep holding on?
[01:43.71]Oh, why do I keep staring down the barrel of a loaded gun?
[01:50.06]Then tell me why can't I just  let go?
[01:55.92]Somebody knows, then tell me
[02:02.91]
[02:13.20]I won't point the finger, but I'll take the blame
[02:19.33]Cause I saw her coming from a million miles away
[02:25.68]I should have fought the feeling, but I gave in
[02:31.45]Cause those lying blue eyes kept on pulling me back in
[02:38.01]
[02:38.58]So tell me, why do I keep holding on?
[02:44.54]Oh, why do I keep staring down the barrel of a loaded gun?
[02:50.61]Then tell me why can't I just let go?
[02:56.59]Somebody knows, then tell me
[03:04.27]
[03:13.44]Oh
[03:19.16]
[03:27.39]So tell me, why do I keep holding on?
[03:33.38]Oh, why do I keep staring down the barrel of a loaded gun?
[03:39.57]Then tell me why can't I just  let go?
[03:45.45]Somebody knows, somebody knows
[03:52.43]Then tell me
[03:57.04]
[03:57.66]Oh, why can't you just tell me?
[04:01.37]
[04:01.94]If you know
