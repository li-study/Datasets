[00:16.13]Starry, starry night
[00:22.96]Paint your palette blue and gray
[00:29.41]Look out on a summer's day
[00:34.17]With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
[00:39.41]Shadows on the hills
[00:45.90]Sketch the trees and daffodils
[00:52.31]Catch the breeze and the winter chills
[00:57.28]In colors on the snowy linen land
[01:03.05]
[01:06.33]Now I understand
[01:12.80]what you tried to say to me
[01:18.71]How you suffered for your sanity
[01:24.94]How you tried to set them free
[01:28.30]They would not listen,
[01:29.85]they did not know how
[01:35.37]Perhaps, they'll listen now
[01:38.84]
[01:42.99]Starry, starry night
[01:49.68]Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
[01:55.82]Swirling clouds in violet haze
[02:00.62]Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
[02:06.10]Colors changing hue
[02:12.34]Morning fields of amber grain
[02:19.09]Weathered faces lined in pain
[02:23.48]Are soothed beneath
[02:25.17]the artist's loving hand
[02:28.35]
[02:28.76]Now I understand
[02:35.22]what you tried to say to me
[02:41.29]How you suffered for your sanity
[02:47.49]And how you tried to set them free
[02:50.84]They would not listen,
[02:52.61]they did not know how
[02:58.42]Perhaps, they'll listen now
[03:02.26]For they could not love you
[03:08.04]And still your love was true
[03:15.29]And when no hope was left inside
[03:19.91]on that starry,
[03:21.71]starry night
[03:24.01]You took your life as lovers often do
[03:30.88]But I could have told you, Vincent
[03:34.79]This world was never meant
[03:36.98]for one as beautiful
[03:41.54]as you
[03:44.20]
[03:47.99]Starry, starry night
[03:54.88]Portraits hung in empty hall
[04:01.53]Frameless heads on nameless walls
[04:06.06]With eyes that watch
[04:07.74]the world and can't forget
[04:11.62]Like the strangers that you've met
[04:18.76]The ragged man in ragged clothes
[04:25.23]The silver thorn of bloody rose
[04:30.00]Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
[04:35.91]
[04:36.34]Now I think I know
[04:42.54]what you tried to say to me
[04:48.32]How you suffered for your sanity
[04:55.41]Then how you tried to set them free
[04:59.22]They would not listen,
[05:00.88]they're not listening still
[05:07.72]Perhaps, they never will..
