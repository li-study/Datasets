[00:24.71]There doesn't have to be a reason
[00:28.39]There doesn't have to be a why
[00:32.36]And any moment could be magical
[00:35.97]it could be this night
[00:39.91]You've got an energy burning like I've never seen
[00:43.32]Bringing me to life
[00:44.60]

[00:48.53]when I'm with you.
[00:52.68]My heart plays a rhythm in my head,
[00:56.28]I can't help, but move,
[01:01.01]Two people synchronized like a power,
[01:04.52]brings you closer,
[01:07.56]That aside and I cant beat the feeling that I get,
[01:11.26]when I'm with you.
