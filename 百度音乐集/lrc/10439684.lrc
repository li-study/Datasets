[00:23.54]There are days
[00:26.30]When I feel
[00:28.38]The best of me
[00:30.55]is ready to begin
[00:33.98]Then there're days
[00:36.49]when I feel
[00:38.35]I'm letting go
[00:41.15]and soaring on the wind
[00:45.10]Cause I've learned in laughter or in pain
[00:50.46]How to survive
[00:53.92]
[00:55.31]I get on my knees
[01:00.28]I get on my knees
[01:05.28]There I am before the love
[01:09.34]that changes me
[01:14.67]See I don't know how but there's power
[01:18.65]When I'm on my knees
[01:25.38]
[01:31.62]I can be
[01:34.35]In a crowd
[01:36.29]or by myself
[01:38.59]or almost anywhere
[01:42.00]when I feel there's a need
[01:46.36]to talk with God
[01:48.96]He is Emmanuel
[01:52.91]When I close my eyes
[01:55.34]no darkness there
[01:58.52]There's only light!
[02:01.40]
[02:02.90]I get on my knees
[02:07.77]I get on my knees
[02:12.92]There I am before the love
[02:16.81]that changes me
[02:21.98]See I don't know how
[02:23.88]but there's power
[02:25.50]In the blue skies
[02:30.88]In the midnight
[02:35.59]When I'm on my knees
[02:44.57]
[02:46.58]I get on my knees
[02:51.60]I get on my knees
[02:56.69]There I am before the love
[03:00.53]that changes me
[03:05.70]See I don't know how
[03:07.90]but there's power
[03:09.43]When I'm on my
[03:13.47]Oh, when I'm on my
[03:19.56]When I'm on my knees
[03:32.63]
