[00:00.50]Johnny
[00:03.11]craig david
[00:05.91]
[00:07.18]It's another day at school
[00:08.50]And he's just walking out the door
[00:10.38]Got his rucksack on his back
[00:11.89]And his feet dragging on the floor
[00:13.78]Always late for when he's questioned
[00:15.50]He can't think of what to say
[00:17.09]Hides the bruises from the teachers
[00:18.67]Hoping that they go away
[00:20.33]Even though his mom and dad
[00:21.80]They both got problems of their own
[00:23.79]Caught a catch at 22
[00:24.84]But he'd still rather be at home
[00:27.20]Cries himself to sleep and prays
[00:28.61]When he wakes up things might have changed
[00:30.47]But everything's still the same
[00:32.90]But didn't you say
[00:34.82]You always said that I should speak up hmm
[00:38.83]But it seems like all the things
[00:42.11]You said to me before meant nothing at all
[00:45.03]Because
[00:47.67]I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
[00:50.59]That's why I'm late for school
[00:52.67](But you never listen)
[00:54.37]Instead you always seem to end up blaming me
[00:57.23]For things I didn't do
[00:59.74](For what it's worth)
[01:01.26]I didn't even want to tell you anything
[01:03.82]In case it made things worse
[01:06.31](Just so you know)
[01:07.87]Everytime I say that Johnny's hitting me
[01:10.43]Hey mom and dad it hurts
[01:13.58]
