[00:04.00]《Over The Rainbow》
[00:06.00]I see trees of green, red roses too
[00:14.30]I see them bloom for me and you
[00:19.70]And I think to myself
[00:24.10]what a wonderful world
[00:32.85]I see skies of blue and clouds of white
[00:40.95]The bright blessed day, and the dark sacred night
[00:46.30]And I think to myself,
[00:50.85]what a wonderful world
[01:00.25]The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
[01:06.58]Are also on the faces of people going by
[01:13.30]I see friends shaking hands, saying, "how do you do?"
[01:21.00]They're really saying, "I love you"
[01:26.60]I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
[01:34.40]They'll learn much more, than I'll never know
[01:40.30]And I think to myself,what a wonderful world
[01:53.30]Yes, I think to myself,
[01:59.00]what a wonderful world~
