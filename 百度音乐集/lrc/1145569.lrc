[00:01.84]It's been nine days, eight hours
[00:04.48]Forty minutes, ten seconds
[00:06.83]Since you called
[00:08.64]I've been so crazy
[00:10.87]I've just about
[00:12.24]Taken our picture
[00:14.27]Off the wall
[00:16.65]It's been three months
[00:18.58]Over hundred days
[00:20.40]Since you held my hand
[00:24.61]And I miss you in
[00:26.42]A thousand ways
[00:27.74]Will I ever see you again?
[00:30.44]
[01:25.32][00:32.53]How did it change so fast?
[01:28.93][00:36.36](I won't give you to the past)
[01:33.04][00:40.33]I really thought it'd last
[01:36.54][00:43.49]
[01:54.22][01:37.13][00:44.23]All that we had was
[01:55.40][01:38.80][00:45.75]So unbelieveable
[01:57.75][01:40.75][00:48.11]Now that it's gone
[01:59.15][01:42.33][00:49.48]It's just inconceivable
[02:01.42][01:44.47][00:51.72]Still in my dreams
[02:02.95][01:46.00][00:53.18]You were so damn beautiful
[02:05.28][01:48.14][00:55.53]How could it be
[02:06.61][01:49.62][00:57.07]That you ruined my
[02:08.05][01:51.03][00:58.32]Everything
[02:08.70][01:51.75][00:59.10]Everything
[02:09.66][01:52.34][00:59.70]Everything?
[02:10.50][01:01.18]
[02:15.56][02:11.76][01:02.17]Everything
[02:16.21][02:12.54][01:02.89]Everything
[02:16.99][02:13.14][01:03.63]Everything
[02:18.30][02:13.39][01:05.91]
[01:09.32]It seems like
[01:10.35]Everywhere's everyone in love
[01:14.23]So, where are you?
[01:17.02]And I remember
[01:18.87]You couldn't get enough
[01:21.81]Said you felt it too
[01:23.75]So didn't you
[02:22.93]Ooh, hooh
[02:25.79]You're really my everything
[02:27.65]Everything
[02:28.45]Everything
[02:29.66]
[02:30.74]Everything
[02:31.35]Everything
[02:32.17]Everything
[02:33.66]
[02:34.58]Everything, everything, everything
[02:38.18]Everything, everything, everything
[02:41.94]Everything, everything, everything
[02:45.46]Everything, everything, everything
[02:48.25]
[02:49.01]It's been nine days, eight hours
[02:51.75]Forty minutes, ten seconds
[02:53.70]Three months, a hundred days
[02:56.95]And I miss you in
[02:58.89]A thousand ways
[03:00.25]Will I ever see you again?
[03:03.22]
