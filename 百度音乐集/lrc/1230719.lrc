[00:38.65]It's a hot night, the natives are restless
[00:42.21]We're sweating by the light of the moon
[00:45.31]There's a voodoo mojo brewing at the go-go
[00:48.85]That could knock a witch off her broom
[00:51.90]
[00:52.35]We slither on in and shed our skin
[00:55.35]Make our way into the bump and the grind

[01:22.25]And she left my heart with vertigo)

[01:49.25]I've been on my knees for half of the night
[01:52.55]Then I'm rolling the bones with Jimmy 'no dice'
[01:56.22]Gonna take him for a couple weeks' pay
[01:59.39]Man, if you lose this roll I take your girlfriend home
[02:02.65]So I stopped
[02:04.26]But you're not gonna believe who comes walking out
