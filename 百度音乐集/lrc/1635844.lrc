[01:55.17][00:16.49]
[00:19.33]It was a cold and wet December day
[00:21.46]When we touched the ground at JFK
[00:23.77]Snow was melting on the ground
[00:26.01]On BLS I heard the sound
[00:28.28]Of an angel
[00:33.16]New York, like a Christmas tree
[00:35.52]Tonight this city belongs to me
[00:37.81]Angel
[00:42.46]Soul love...this love won't let me go
[00:51.93]So long...Angel of Harlem
[01:05.82]Birdland on fifty-three
[01:08.01]The street sounds like a symphony
[01:10.36]We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
[01:12.64]Miles says she's got to be an angel
[01:19.68]Lady Day got diamond eyes
[01:22.08]She sees the truth behind the lies
[01:25.00]Angel
[01:29.01]Soul love...this love won't let me go
[01:38.72]So long...Angel of Harlem
[01:46.64]Angel of Harlem
[02:00.66]She says it's heart...heart and soul...
[02:10.33]Yeah yeah...(yeah)
[02:14.57]Yeah yeah...(right now)
[02:20.39]Blue light on the avenue
[02:22.61]God knows they got to you
[02:24.96]An empty glass, the lady sings
[02:27.32]Eyes swollen like a bee sting
[02:29.68]Blinded you lost your way
[02:31.99]Through the side streets and the alleyway
[02:34.29]Like a star exploding in the night
[02:36.70]Falling to the city in broad daylight
[02:38.96]An angel in Devil's shoes
[02:41.30]Salvation in the blues
[02:43.69]You never looked like an angel
[02:48.91]Yeah yeah...Angel of Harlem
[03:02.45]Angel...Angel of Harlem...
[03:10.49][Repeat and fade]
