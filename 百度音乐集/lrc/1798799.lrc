[00:12.97]I can't help myself if I don't wanna be with nobody else
[00:18.95]I don't wanna leave my baby's side
[00:22.06]And I don't wanna kiss nobody else
[00:25.34]And I'll pass any test 'cause nothing in this world or in the next
[00:31.13]Could make me second guess
[00:32.62]Could make me change my mind
[00:34.12]Could make me not protect what I'm feeling inside
[00:37.51]Because I'm smart enough to know that this is a good thing
[00:42.00]Please believe it, please believe it
[00:43.50]And I'm smart enough to stay right where I belong
[00:49.79]And I'm faithful enough to know that this is meant to be
[00:55.98]And if it's not, then don't speak
[00:58.56]Don't ruin it, let me dream
[01:02.95]Hear me, hear me
[01:05.75]This is for my baby
[01:08.64]There will never be another
[01:10.05]There's so many ways I love you
[01:11.63]And that's just for the record babe
[01:14.83]I need you, need you
[01:18.12]I can't wait to see you
[01:21.11]I so love when were together
[01:22.51]Can't nobody do it better
[01:23.81]And that's just for the record babe
[01:28.40]I can't be perfect
[01:29.69]No one is flawless
[01:31.39]But rest in mind
[01:32.69]I'll be there through the good and the bad and the ugly and worse
[01:36.68]So if it's something that you're lacking, go and tell me first
[01:40.87]Because I'm smart enough to know that this is a good thing
[01:47.07]Smart enough to stay right where I belong, oh, no, no, no
[01:52.14]And I'm faithful enough to know that this is meant to be
[01:58.34]And if it's not, then don't speak

[02:35.85]And if there's any way to leave
[02:38.75]don't tell me cause I don't wanna go
[02:41.93]I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause I don't wanna miss you
[02:45.44]This is my team and I love my position
[02:48.72]Lead me anywhere, I'll go with you there
