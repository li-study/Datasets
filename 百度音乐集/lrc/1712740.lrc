[00:26.12]This is what it's like falling out of love
[00:32.47]This is the way you lose your very best friend
[00:38.54]This is how it feels when it's all over
[00:45.23]This is just the way a true love ends
[00:54.78]First of all, there's no one you can talk to
[01:00.95]When there is, they just don't seem to hear
[01:07.37]Words don't seem to matter much, anyway
[01:13.40]They can't describe the pain, they can't explain the fear
[01:20.10]Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through
[01:26.14]Still, you hate to see the morning come
[01:32.54]Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore
[01:38.78]The future holds no promise, your life's already done
[01:45.53]This is what it's like falling out of love
[01:51.20]This is the way you lose your very best friend
[01:57.72]This is how it feels when it's all over
[02:03.52]This is just the way a true love ends
[02:13.91]Then you find your heart no longer flutters
[02:20.15]And you no longer look through a lover's eyes
[02:26.51]What's to see when the world falls down around you?
[02:32.36]You simply can't believe it, but it comes as no surprise
[02:38.92]This is what it's like falling out of love
[02:45.47]This is the way you lose your very best friend
[02:51.44]This is how it feels when it's all over
[02:57.23]This is just the way a true love ends
[03:04.39]What's this sense of failure? It's such an incredible loss
[03:10.54]It's all the things you'll never do
[03:13.69]and all the dreams that will never come true
[03:17.15]This is what it's like falling out of love
[03:23.17]This is the way you lose your very best friend
[03:29.43]This is how it feels when it's all over
[03:35.95]This is just the way a true love ends
[03:41.84]Oh, this is just the way a true love ends
[03:48.21]I don't believe a true love ever ends
