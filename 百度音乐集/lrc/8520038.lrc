[00:02.50]
[00:05.20]What's up girl.
[00:08.14]I need to talk to you for a minute.
[00:14.20]I can't keep playin my self like this.
[00:17.84]Theres only one thing I want to know.
[00:20.99]Should I stay,...Or should I go.
[00:23.95]
[00:24.43]It's not my fault that you made yourself.
[00:27.40]A regretful past.
[00:30.46]All I know is, It makes me look bad.
[00:37.16]And when I'm holding your hand and you see your friends you know
[00:42.50]And they walk away laughing
[00:45.04]Calling me a fool
[00:48.56]Now baby i can't
[00:52.52]Change the things you did before we met.
[00:57.55]Even though I did'nt know you.
[01:00.65]It's hard for me to,
[01:04.53]Trust you even though, girl I love you.
[01:09.63]So tell what am I to do.
[01:13.58]Don't know.
[01:14.98]If we will last.
[01:16.48]Nothing we do can erase the past
[01:19.10]Now can you tell me I don't know.
[01:22.33]Should I stay or let it go.
[01:25.49]Dont know if we were ment to be
[01:28.54]And if we should be committed faithfully
[01:31.15]But can you tell me i don't know
[01:34.24]Should I stay or let it go
[01:36.72]I think of the nite that I made reservations just for two.
[01:42.54]But you gave your attention to someone across the room.
[01:48.66]I should of known right then that things just were'nt right.
[01:54.47]But I could'nt see it,
[01:56.90]Cause love had me so blind.
[02:00.49]Now tell me how can,
[02:04.47]-I be so secure in loving you, and everybody's calling me a fool
[02:12.54]I can't keep holding,
[02:15.95]-On to broken promises from you, i can't take no more from you
[02:25.55]Don't know.

[02:47.95]Baby time and time again i tried to open up my heart
[02:55.33]And I think of losing all we had to gain
[03:00.78]Girl if it takes me losing you,
[03:04.30]For happiness in me
[03:07.43]I think that I, might just have to let you go
