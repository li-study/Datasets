[00:17.83]I should have seen it coming when roses died
[00:22.50]Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
[00:26.83]I should have listened when you said good night
[00:30.04]You really meant good bye
[00:35.05]Baby, ain't it funny, how you never ever learn to fall
[00:39.27]You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
[00:43.79]But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you
[00:51.14]I cried and I cried
[00:54.13]There were nights that died for you baby
[00:59.50]I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
[01:07.12]If the love that I got for you is gone
[01:11.77]If the river I cried ain't that long
[01:15.50]Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
[01:24.77]Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
[01:29.04]Like we got away with the perfect crime but
[01:33.43]We were just a legend in my mind
[01:37.05]I guess that I was blind
[01:41.47]Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
[01:45.65]The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
[01:50.08]You and I were the renegades, some things never change
[01:57.11]It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
[02:05.74]Now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving
[02:13.71]If the love that I got for you is gone
[02:17.40]If the river I've cried ain't that long
[02:21.42]Then I'm wrong, yes I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
[02:29.44]If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
[02:33.74]Is the reason that I'm holding on
[02:37.44]Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song

[03:02.29]I cried and I cried
[03:04.14]There were nights that I died for you baby
[03:10.39]I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy
[03:17.99]If the love that I got for you is gone
[03:22.26]If the river I cried ain't that long
[03:26.40]Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't no love song
[03:34.35]If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
[03:39.07]Is the reason that I'm holding on
[03:42.52]Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
[03:50.58]Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
