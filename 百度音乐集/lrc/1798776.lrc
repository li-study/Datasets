[00:08.78]Is there anything that can make you happy?
[00:12.77]I don’t know what to say to make it better
[00:16.96]Seeing you like this down and hurt so badly
[00:22.05]when you have been so kept together
[00:25.65][01:11.53]What’s this
[00:26.94][01:12.72]All this time I thought you didn’t need me
[00:31.33][01:16.91]Now I’ve gone from you and now you tell me
[00:35.62][01:21.40]You’re in love but that was not what it was
[00:38.71][01:24.61]All those times that pass by
[00:41.11][01:26.89]When those times and now you’re telling me
[00:44.50][01:30.09]You miss me boy I couldn’t I see and my heart don’t
[00:49.19][01:34.97]agree with what you tell me
[00:54.58]You were nonchalant, strong and unaffected
[00:58.47]and you never wanted me to be there
[01:02.96]I never saw your heart that’s how close you kept it
[01:07.36]So right now I’m so unsure how to care
[01:38.95]You’re in love but that was not what it was
[01:41.56]All those times that pass by
[01:44.23]When those times and now you’re telling me
[01:47.53]You miss me boy I couldn’t I see and my heart don’t
[01:52.12]agree with what you tell me
[01:55.61]No attention was given
[01:59.50]no affection from you to heal the hurt
[02:03.99]I was hoping
[02:06.10]I was wishing just to listen and to hear those words.
[02:13.87]You’re in love but that was not what it was
[02:16.96]All those times that pass by
[02:19.16]When those times and now you’re telling me
[02:22.65]You miss me boy I couldn’t I see and my heart don’t
[02:27.04]agree with what you tell me
[02:31.33]You’re in love but that was not what it was
[02:33.93]All those times that pass by
[02:36.62]When those times and now you’re telling me
[02:40.21]You miss me boy I couldn’t I see and my heart don’t
[02:44.92]agree with what you tell me
