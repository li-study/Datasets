[00:20.59]Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
[00:23.67]Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble
[00:26.27]The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
[00:28.91]who don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare
[00:31.23]at the out-of-towners  (Ay, yo, yo, who that?)  They better break North
[00:33.75]before we get the four pounders, and take their face off
[00:36.54]The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasin brothers
[00:39.33]The D.A.'s on the roof, tryin to, watch us and knock us
[00:41.82]And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
[00:44.29]I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
[00:47.12]the fronters, wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners
[00:49.52]Thinkin it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em
[00:52.10]and leave em done, won't even run about Gods
[00:54.42]I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
[00:57.34]Nas is a rebel of the street corner
[00:59.73]Pullin a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure
[01:02.55]
[01:03.08]Represent, represent!! (repeat 4X)
[01:12.54]
[01:12.90]Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
[01:15.43]Moet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller
[01:17.87]who's always on the corner, rollin up blessed
[01:20.59]When I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess
[01:22.97]Cold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back
[01:25.50]Love committin sins and my friends sell crack
[01:28.15]This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
[01:30.59]The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
[01:33.30]cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts
[01:35.80]So I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts
[01:38.80]The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
[01:41.56]The type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator
[01:44.04]Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
[01:46.56]Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames
[01:49.10]Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
[01:51.53]Fly new chicKs and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's
[01:53.58]
[01:54.15]Represent, represent!! (repeat 3X)
[02:01.52]
[02:01.89]No doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about
[02:04.34]Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
[02:06.73]Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
[02:09.37]I used to wake up every mornin, see my crew on the block
[02:11.96]Every day's a different plan that had us runnin from cops
[02:14.72]If it wasn't hangin out in front of cocaine spots
[02:17.19]We was at the candy factory, breakin the locks
[02:19.77]Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
[02:22.59]Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
[02:25.59]Could use a gun Son, but fuck bein the wanted man
[02:27.83]but if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
[02:30.62]Then call the crew to get live too
[02:32.58]with Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
[02:35.54]Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
[02:38.21]My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
[02:40.83]It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
[02:44.80]Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, One Love
