[00:03.50][00:00.50]Pain Lies on the Riverside
[00:01.50]Live
[00:02.50]Mental Jewelry
[00:24.50]I have never taken life
[00:32.50]Yet I have often paid the price
[00:39.50]And you, you are a victim of this age
[00:47.50]And the guilt that hangs around your neck
[00:51.50]Has got me locked up in a cage
[00:54.50]You've got to learn to live until no end
[01:02.50]But first you must learn to swim
[01:06.50]All over again
[01:10.50]Because...
[02:37.50][01:11.50]Pain lies on the riverside
[02:44.50][01:18.50]And pain will never say goodbye
[02:52.50][01:26.50]Pain lies on the riverside
[02:59.50][01:34.50]So put your feet in the water
[03:03.50][01:37.50]Put your head in the water
[03:07.50][01:41.50]Put your soul in the water
[03:09.50][01:43.50]And join me for a swim tonight
[01:50.50]I have forever, always tried
[01:57.50]To stay clean and constantly baptized
[02:04.50]I am aware now that the river's banks they are dry
[02:12.50]And to wait for a flood
[02:16.50]Is to wait
[02:18.50]For life
[02:19.50]I've got to learn to live until no end
[02:28.50]But first I must learn to swim
[02:31.50]All over again
[02:35.50]Because...
