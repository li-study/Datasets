[00:00.00]Sarah McLachlan - Stupid
[00:06.15]
[00:10.15]Night lift up the shades
[00:13.44]let in the brilliant light of morning
[00:17.95]but steady me now
[00:20.30]for I am weak and starving for mercy
[00:28.31]sleep has left me alone
[00:31.79]to carry the weight of unravelling where we went wrong
[00:37.63]it's all I can do to hang on,
[00:41.09]to keep me from falling
[00:44.06]into old familiar shoes
[00:47.72]
[Chorus:]
[00:49.00]how stupid could I be
[00:53.68]a simpleton could see
[00:58.22]that you're no good for me
[01:02.57]but you're the only one I see
[01:07.92]
[01:12.32]love has made me a fool
[01:15.75]set me on fire and watched as I floundered
[01:20.47]unable to speak
[01:22.66]except to cry out and wait for your answer
[01:30.80]but you come around in your time
[01:34.19]speaking of fabulous places
[01:37.59]create an oasis
[01:40.16]that dries up as soon as you're gone
[01:43.49]you leave me here burning
[01:46.35]in this desert without you
[01:50.06]
[Chorus]
[01:51.29]how stupid could I be
[01:56.03]a simpleton could see
[02:00.60]that you're no good for me
[02:05.25]but you're the only one I see
[02:11.55]everything changes
[02:15.96]everything falls apart
[02:19.42]I can't stand to feel myself losing control
[02:23.89]in the deep of my senses I know
[02:27.81]
[Chorus x2]
[02:49.19][02:28.36]how stupid could I be
[02:53.84][02:32.95]a simpleton could see
[02:58.34][02:37.61]that you're no good for me
[03:02.85][02:42.19]but you're the only one I see
[03:11.28]
