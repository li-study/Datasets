[00:03.56]I saw a friend that i once knew at a funeral,
[00:11.57]He took the time out to be seen.
[00:20.56]His eyes kept glancing to the hour hand on the gold watch,
[00:28.34]that he'd been given by a magazine.
[00:33.68]
[00:36.50]He didn't cry when the priest gave the sermon,
[00:43.66]Just pulled up the woolen collar on his fleece.
[00:51.79]Crossed his arms, gave a sigh and checked the time again,
[00:59.30]As he sat inches from the wife of the deceased.
[01:04.56]
[01:05.91]He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls,
[01:14.50]From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small
[01:21.65]Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands,
[01:29.07]He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands
[01:35.42]
[01:51.50]He took a chauffeur driven car back to his hotel,
[01:59.76]Passing through the sick streets where he was born
[02:07.11]He said "Driver, what's happened to these buildings?
[02:15.15]They all look run down and so alone."
[02:20.97]
[02:22.77]He took a shower in the bathroom of his penthouse,
[02:30.48]Put the Do not Disturb on his door
[02:37.73]When the maid came in the morning
[02:45.06]She found him shivering on the bedroom floor
[02:50.42]
[02:52.35]He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls,
[02:59.67]From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small
[03:07.91]Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands,
[03:14.76]He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands
[03:20.83]
[03:21.83]He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls,
[03:29.04]From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small
[03:36.20]Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands,
[03:43.73]He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands
