[00:13.05]Eva Cassidy
[00:17.05]For you there'll be no crying
[00:30.06]For you the sun will be shining
[00:42.05]'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
[00:48.05]It's alright, I know it's right
[01:01.05]And the songbirds keep singing
[01:05.05]Like they know the score
[01:10.05]
[01:13.05]And I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:19.10]Like never before
[01:23.05]
[02:13.13]...To you, I would give the world
[02:26.05]To you, I'd never be cold
[02:40.05]'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
[02:46.05]It's alright, I know it's right
[02:59.05]And the songbirds keep singing
[03:03.05]Like they know the score
[03:11.05]And I love you, I love you, I love you
[03:17.05]Like never before
[03:23.05]Like never before;
[03:28.05]like never before.
