[00:12.00]Just a perfect day
[00:16.00]Drink sangria in the park
[00:21.00]And then later, when it gets dark, we'll go home
[00:32.00]Just a perfect day
[00:36.00]Feed animals in the zoo
[00:41.00]Then later a movie too, and then home
[01:57.00][00:50.00]Oh it's such a perfect day
[02:02.00][00:55.00]I'm glad I spent it with you
[02:08.00][01:01.00]Oh such a perfect day
[02:16.00][02:11.00][01:09.00][01:04.00]You just keep me hanging on
[01:19.00]Just a perfect day
[01:24.00]Problems all left alone
[01:29.00]Weekenders on our own
[01:31.00]It's such fun
[01:39.00]Just a perfect day
[01:43.00]You make me forget myself
[01:48.00]I thought I was someone else
[01:52.00]Someone good
[03:07.00][02:57.00][02:47.00][02:37.00]You're going to reap just what you sow
