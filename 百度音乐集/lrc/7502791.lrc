[00:00.95]Chains
[00:10.88]
[00:42.00]Your arms are warm but they make me feel
[00:47.54]As if they're made of cold, cold steel
[00:52.72]A simple kiss like a turnin' key
[00:58.08]A little click and the lock's on me
[01:02.47]Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands
[01:07.74]I won't admit to where I am
[01:11.52]But I know baby, I'm in chains
[01:22.61]I'm in chains
[01:27.39]
[01:29.20]I pretend I can always leave
[01:34.73]Free to go whenever I please
[01:39.89]But then the sound of my desperate calls
[01:45.21]Echo off these dungeon walls
[01:49.44]I've crossed the line from mad to sane
[01:54.61]A thousand times and back again
[01:58.53]I love you baby, I'm in chains
[02:09.24]I'm in chains
[02:14.47]I'm in chains
[02:19.74]I'm in chains
[02:29.37]
[02:37.47]Should have known passing through the gate
[02:42.65]That once inside I could not escape
[02:46.64]I never thought this could happen to me
[02:51.62]Never thought this is where I'd be
[02:55.76]But baby, baby, baby, look at me
[03:05.57]Baby, baby, look at me, I'm in chains
[03:17.57]I'm in chains
[03:23.15]I never thought this is where I'd be
[03:28.27]Never thought this could happen to me ...
[03:34.93]
[03:40.09]Fade
