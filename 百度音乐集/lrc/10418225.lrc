[00:26.03]Well, you must tell me, baby
[00:28.82]How your head feels under somethin' like that
[00:32.80]Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
[00:35.95]Well, you look so pretty in it

[02:00.86]Yes, I disobeyed his orders
[02:06.15]I came to see you
[02:07.33]But I found him there instead
[02:11.63]You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me
[02:14.08]But I sure wish he'd take that off his head

[02:24.28]You know, I never seen him before
[02:27.78]Well, I saw him
[02:31.19]Makin' love with him
[02:32.91]You forgot to close the garage door
[02:38.07]You might think he loves you for your money
[02:40.46]But I know what he really loves you for
[02:43.08]It's your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
