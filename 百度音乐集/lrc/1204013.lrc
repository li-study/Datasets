[00:01.51]We Will Never Forget
[00:09.69]A song was heard in China in the city of the heat
[00:15.55]In the spring of 1989, you can hear the people sing,
[00:21.81]And it was a song of freedom that is ringing in the square
[00:28.06]The world can feel passion and love people gathered there
[00:32.92]Oh, children, blood on the square
[00:45.98]For many nights and many days Waiting in the square
[00:52.84]To build a better nation was the song echoed there
[00:58.24]We are China's children. We love our native land
[01:05.18]For brotherhood and freedom we are joining hand in hand
[01:12.58]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[01:24.49]
[02:01.20]Then came the People's Army with trucks, and tanks and guns
[02:08.91]The government was frightened of their daughters and sons
[02:14.63]But in the square was courage and vision, true and fair
[02:21.34]The army of the people would not harm the young ones there
[02:27.05]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[02:38.97]On June 3rd of China in the spring of 89
[02:45.48]An order came from high above passed on down the line
[02:51.39]The soldiers opened fire, young people bled and died
[02:57.91]The blood of thousands on the square that the lies can never hide
[03:04.62]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[03:16.33]For four more days of fury, the people faced the guns
[03:22.04]Of many thousands slaughtered when their grizzly? work was done
[03:29.76]They quickly burned the bodies to hide their cowardship
[03:34.47]The blood is stacked upon their hands and darkness on their names
[03:41.18]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[04:31.90]Their tears flow in China for her children that are gone
[04:37.61]There is fear, there is hiding, for the killing is still going on
[04:44.32]The iron hand of terror can buy silence for today
[04:49.04]But the blood that lies upon the square cannot be washed away
[04:56.75]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[05:03.46]Oh, children, blood is on the square
[05:07.17]Oh, children, blood is on the square
