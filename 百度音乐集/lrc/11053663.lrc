[01:32.68][00:36.81]I'd rather have a beer than a melon (cash than a diamond)
[01:36.76][00:40.80]Outside freedom for the man who is not free
[01:40.66][00:44.70]Oh let the whiskey keeps us following
[01:44.30][00:48.44]
[02:00.90][01:44.50][00:48.65]Let me drink let me high I'll find a better step
[02:04.50][01:48.34][00:52.51]Let me out let me talk I'll do my duty job
[02:08.45][01:52.46][00:56.58]Something good something bad you could choose on your own
[02:12.39][01:56.43][01:00.51]Something high something low I think we are rolling on this road
[02:19.34][01:04.83]
