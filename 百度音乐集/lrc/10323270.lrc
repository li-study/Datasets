[00:02.25]Scenes From An Italian Restaurant
[00:04.09]
[00:14.78]A bottle of white, a bottle of red
[00:21.58]Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
[00:28.09]We'll get a table near the street
[00:31.89]In our old familiar place
[00:35.06]You and I, face to face oooh
[00:40.25]
[00:41.52]A bottle of red, a bottle of white
[00:48.24]It all depends on your appetite
[00:55.32]I'll meet you any time you want
[00:59.09]In our Italian Restaurant.
[01:02.91]
[01:44.16]Things are okay with me these days
[01:46.18]Got a good job, got a good office
[01:48.54]Got a new wife, got a new life
[01:51.09]And the family is fine
[01:53.78]Oh, we lost touch long ago
[01:56.12]You lost weight, I did not know
[01:58.85]You could ever look so nice after so much time!
[02:02.74]
[02:03.97]Do you remember those days hanging out at the village green?
[02:09.10]Engineer boots, leather jackets,and tight blue jeans
[02:13.51]Oh, you'd drop a dime in the box play a song
[02:15.84]About New Orleans
[02:19.47]Cold beer, hot lights
[02:21.69]My sweet romantic teenage nights
[02:25.13]
[03:12.58]Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
[03:14.41]And the king and the queen at the prom
[03:17.14]Riding around with the car top down
[03:19.27]And the radio on
[03:21.98]Nobody looked any finer or was more of a hit at the ParkwayDiner
[03:26.47]We never knew we could want more than that out of life
[03:31.17]Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
[03:35.02]
[03:44.00]Brenda and Eddie were still going steady in the summer of '75
[03:48.91]When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July
[03:53.52]Everyone said they were crazy
[03:55.89]Brenda you know you're much too lazy
[03:58.41]And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life
[04:03.16]But there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye.
[04:06.33]
[04:10.45]They got an apartment with deep pile carpet
[04:12.68]And a couple of paintings from Sears
[04:15.37]A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
[04:17.51]They had saved for a couple of years
[04:20.14]But they started to fight when the money got tight
[04:22.22]And they just didn't count on the tears
[04:25.69]
[04:55.39]Well they lived for a while in a very nice style
[04:57.55]But it's always the same in the end
[05:00.21]They got a divorce as a matter of course
[05:02.29]And they parted the closest of friends
[05:04.94]Then the king and the queen went back to the green
[05:06.90]But you can never go back there again.
[05:08.67]
[05:13.43]Brenda and Eddie had had it already
[05:15.65]By the summer of '75
[05:18.12]From the high to the low to the end of the show
[05:20.37]For the rest of their lives
[05:23.12]They couldn't go back to the greasers
[05:25.31]The best they could do was pick up the pieces
[05:27.85]But we always knew they would both find a way to get by
[05:31.45]Oh, that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
[05:35.42]Can't tell you more cause I told you already
[05:37.60]And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye.
[05:40.60]
[06:27.06]A bottle of red, and bottle of white
[06:34.51]Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
[06:41.09]I'll meet you anytime you want
[06:44.58]In our Italian Restaurant
[06:48.71]
