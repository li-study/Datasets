[00:05.17]As soon as you're born they make you feel small
[00:13.18]By giving you no time instead of it all
[00:21.17]Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
[00:29.35]A working class hero is something to be
[00:37.25]A working class hero is something to be
[00:45.31]They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
[00:53.84]They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
[01:00.84]Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
[01:09.89]A working class hero is something to be
[01:17.75]A working class hero is something to be
[01:25.62]When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
[01:32.95]Then they expect you to pick a career
[01:41.81]When you can't really function you're so full of fear
[01:48.64]A working class hero is something to be
[01:56.52]A working class hero is something to be
[02:04.37]Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
[02:12.31]And you think you're so clever and classless and free
[02:20.49]But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
[02:28.40]A working class hero is something to be
[02:36.32]A working class hero is something to be
[02:44.40]There's room at the top they are telling you still
[02:51.74]But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
[03:00.14]If you want to be like the folks on the hill
[03:07.62]A working class hero is something to be
[03:16.31]A working class hero is something to be
[03:23.67]If you want to be a hero well just follow me
[03:31.27]If you want to be a hero well just follow me
