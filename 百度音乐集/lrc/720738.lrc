[00:23.64]All these visions in my head
[00:26.06]shoot the gunner baby for the watershed
[00:28.70]some are live and some are dead
[00:31.33]makes no diferrence when they're in your head...head
[00:34.98]
[00:44.42]Keep the door open a crack
[00:46.93]so I can see then when they attack
[00:49.49]some are white and some are black
[00:52.14]makes no difference when they're on your back
[00:54.45]And I can't stop crying
[00:59.65]And I can't stop trying
[01:04.75]'Cause the day is dying...dying...dying

[01:33.48]And I can't stop crying
[01:38.88]And I can't stop trying
[01:43.84]'Cause the day is dying...dying...dying
[01:49.21]With my eyes wide open
