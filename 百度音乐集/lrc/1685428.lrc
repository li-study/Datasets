[00:00.00]A Whiter Shade Of Pale
[00:04.00]Annie Lennox
[00:06.00]From (Annie Lennox Live In Central Park)
[00:09.00]Lyric edit by Weber
[00:13.42]
[00:31.04]We skipped the light Fandango
[00:37.70]And turned cartwheels across the floor
[00:43.50]I was feeling kind of seasick
[00:50.49]But the crowd called out for more
[00:57.50]The room was humming harder
[01:04.64]As the ceiling flew away
[01:12.17]When we called out for another drink
[01:18.91]The waiter brought a tray
[01:21.15]And so it was that later
[01:26.05]As the miller told his tale
[01:34.41]That her face at first just ghostly
[01:40.51]Turned a whiter shade of pale
[02:17.23]She said "There is no reason...
[02:22.05]And the truth is plain to see"
[02:27.49]But I wandered through my playing cards
[02:34.86]And would not let her be
[02:41.96]One of sixteen vestal virgins
[02:49.35]Who were leaving for the coast
[02:54.52]And although my eyes were open
[03:02.29]They might just as well have been closed
[03:06.70]And so it was that later
[03:15.92]As the miller told his tale
[03:22.43]That her face at first just ghostly
[03:27.64]Turned a whiter shade of pale
