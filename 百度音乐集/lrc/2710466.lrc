[00:07.36]I sit and wait
[00:10.32]Does an angel contemplate my fate?
[00:20.10]And do they know
[00:22.52]The places where we go
[00:25.21]When we're gray and old?
[00:31.54]'Cause I've been told
[00:35.61]That salvation lets their wings unfold
[00:45.07]So when I'm lying in my bed
[00:48.78]Thoughts running through my head
[00:52.17]And I feel the love is dead
[00:56.18]I'm loving angels instead
[01:00.05]And through it all she offers me protection
[01:06.68]A lot of love and affection
[01:09.86]Whether I'm right or wrong
[01:13.03]And down the waterfall
[01:15.99]Wherever it may take me
[01:19.19]I know that life won't break me
[01:22.39]When I come to call
[01:25.95]She won't forsake me
[01:30.85]I'm loving angels instead
[01:37.12]When I'm feeling weak
[01:38.50]And my brain walks down a one way street
[01:48.51]I look above
[01:51.37]And I know I'll always be blessed with love
[02:01.88]And as the feeling grows
[02:04.54]She breathes flesh to my bones
[02:08.16]And when love is dead
[02:11.93]I'm loving angels instead
[02:16.17]And through it all she offers me protection
[02:22.27]A lot of love and affection
[02:25.46]Whether I'm right or wrong
[02:28.71]And down the waterfall
[02:31.76]Wherever it may take me
[02:34.98]I know that life won't break me
[02:38.11]When I come to call
[02:41.79]She won't forsake me
[02:46.58]I'm loving angels instead
[03:25.49]And through it all she offers me protection
[03:31.82]A lot of love and affection
[03:35.15]Whether I'm right or wrong
[03:38.22]And down the waterfall
[03:41.25]Wherever it may take me
[03:44.44]I know that life won't break me
[03:47.59]When I come to call
[03:51.20]She won't forsake me
[03:56.08]I'm loving angels instead
