[00:21.09]When I try to describe
[00:26.21]How I feel when you hold me
[00:31.35]I get butterflies
[00:34.30]I hear lullabies
[00:37.03]It's hard to explain
[03:45.19][03:20.57][03:00.22][02:38.15][02:13.01][01:51.00][01:27.87][01:02.62][00:40.27]
[00:41.53]Like the scent of a rose
[00:46.66]Or the sound of the rain
[00:52.30]Is too precious and too wonderful
[00:57.62]To give it a name
[02:13.36][01:13.20][01:03.03]Too beautiful for words
[02:18.26][01:07.99]A symphony inside me
[03:36.87][03:15.78][02:28.84][01:18.27]I can not take them lightly
[03:41.25][02:33.56][01:23.03]Can you hear my silent heart
[01:30.88]It's on the tip of my tongue
[01:36.19]But my lips are still sealed
[01:41.56]Only violins
[01:44.55]And then innocence
[01:47.00]Can show you how I feel
[01:51.76]And I hear them again
[01:56.94]At the end of the day
[02:02.51]I'm all teary eyed
[02:05.30]When we kissed goodbye
[02:08.09]There's nothing I can say
[02:23.56]Too beautiful for words, oh
[02:39.54]Must be a million times
[02:43.67]I tried to express this love of mine
[02:48.88]When it goes this deep
[02:51.74]When it tastes this sweet
[02:54.82]It's not easy to define, ohh
[03:01.37]Too beautiful for words (too beautiful)
[03:05.76]A symphony inside me (a symphony inside of me)
[03:13.89]Too beautiful for words (for words)
[03:21.87]Too beautiful for words (too beautiful ohh)
[03:27.46]A symphony inside me (a symphony, oh)
[03:31.12]Too beautiful for words (ohh, too beautiful baby)
[03:47.54]Ohh yeah, yeah, oooh...
