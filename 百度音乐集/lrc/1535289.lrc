[00:17.82]She hangs her head and cries on my shirt.
[00:24.29]She must be hurt very badly.
[00:29.46]Tell me what's making you sadly?
[00:35.32]Open your door, don't hide in the dark.
[00:40.39]You're lost in the dark, you can trust me.
[00:45.64]'cause you know that's how it must be.
[00:53.69]Lisa lisa, sad lisa lisa.
[01:05.51]Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
[01:11.79]Upon her pain getting deeper.
[01:17.04]Though my love wants to relieve her.
[01:22.54]She walks alone from wall to wall.
[01:28.17]Lost in a hall, she can't hear me.
[01:33.04]Though i know she likes to be near me.
[01:41.17]Lisa lisa, sad lisa lisa.
[02:42.31]She sits in a corner by the door.
[02:48.44]There must be more i can tell her.
[02:53.43]If she really wants me to help her.
[02:59.06]I'll do what i can to show her the way.
[03:04.43]And maybe one day i will free her.
[03:09.56]Though i know no one can see her.
[03:17.68]Lisa lisa, sad lisa lisa.
