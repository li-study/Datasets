[00:25.87]Spending all my nights,
[00:28.05]All my money going out on the town
[00:32.51]Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
[00:38.18]But when the morning comes,
[00:40.07]I'm right back where I started again
[00:44.70]Trying to forget you is just a waste of time

[02:14.67]Now that I put it all together
[02:20.70]Give me the chance to make you see
[02:26.78]Have you used up all the love in your heart
[02:32.46]Nothing left for me,
