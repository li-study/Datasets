[00:06.73]
[00:09.05]Took for granted what we had
[00:11.83]Until you went away
[00:14.56]You went and broke my heart
[00:17.06]Into a thousand pieces
[00:19.89]Even though it's not your fault
[00:22.93]I'm left with silent prayers
[00:25.57]I look to the heavens above
[00:28.26]Tell me can you here me
[00:29.19]
[00:31.38]Oh I ask myself
[00:35.13]Am I the one to blame?
[00:42.06]Oh I guess I should
[00:45.92]Have seen the signs,
[00:47.01]should read between the lines
[00:51.08]My fears came true
[00:54.27]I'm living without you..
[00:54.88]
[00:58.85]As the days go by
[01:02.55]I still mourn inside
[01:05.26]Do you hear my cries?
[01:07.93]Living without you..
[01:10.54]As the days go by
[01:13.16]I still wonder why
[01:16.19]Leaving us behind
[01:18.41]Living without you..
[01:19.40]
[01:32.07]On a Febuary day
[01:35.23]They took your soul away
[01:38.06]There was silence all around
[01:40.74]I couldn't believe it
[01:43.20]I've got your vision in my head
[01:45.66]See you sleeping in your bed
[01:48.60]And this home has lost its joy
[01:51.20]Your're still here with me
[01:52.78]
[01:54.07]Now I'm standing here
[01:57.71]Am I the one to blame?
[02:02.00]My fears came true
[02:05.28]I'm living without you..
[02:06.53]
[02:09.51]As the days go by
[02:12.01]I still mourn inside
[02:14.45]Do you hear my cries?
[02:17.08]Living without you..
[02:20.08]As the days go by
[02:22.76]I still wonder why
[02:25.62]Leaving us behind
[02:28.08]Living without you..
[02:28.84]
[02:38.52]Living without you...
[02:44.82]Still wonder why..
[02:49.07]Living without you...
[02:51.33]
[02:53.74]There is no compensation
[02:57.98]there is no subsitude
[03:03.37]You lightened up darkest days
[03:07.69]your spirit will see me through
[03:13.87]
[03:16.07]As the days go by
[03:18.74]I still mourn inside
[03:21.41]Do you hear my cries?
[03:24.04]Living without you..
[03:26.80]As the days go by
[03:29.47]I still wonder why
[03:32.22]Leaving us behind
[03:34.54]Living without you..
[03:35.58]
[03:37.73]As the days go by
[03:40.30]I still mourn inside
[03:42.70]Do you hear my cries?
[03:45.49]Living without you..
[03:51.31]Still wonder why..
[03:55.90]Living without you..
[04:03.69]Living without you..
[04:10.02]Without you..
