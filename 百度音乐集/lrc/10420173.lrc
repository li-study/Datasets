[00:08.61]I AM READY FOR THE GOOD TIMES
[00:16.71]I don’t wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
[00:20.19]Time will bring them back I bet
[00:24.12]So if you hear me say that I believe in love
[00:28.21]Don’t make me feel ashamed
[00:32.02]I used to sing the saddest songs
[00:34.03]And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
[00:36.23]Falling back down to the floor
[00:40.06]I used to read survival guides
[00:42.01]When my world was full of seven legged cats
[00:44.03]But here iam with eight more lives
[00:48.01]I’m ready for the good times
[00:49.47]I’m ready for the good tims
[00:51.96]Ready to get it on
[00:55.40]I’m ready for the good times
[00:57.49]I’m ready for the good tims
[00:59.90]Now that I’m not olone
[01:02.95]Oh oh oh oh (3x)
[01:10.88]You know it
[01:12.38]Oh oh oh (2x)
[01:16.72]You better now ignore it.
[01:28.17]I don’t want to look at fashion magazines
[01:31.62]While someone is doing my naiels
[01:35.49]Sitting here watching other people live
[01:39.64]Frozen by the fear to fail
[01:43.36]Cause everyday theres a war to fight
[01:45.45]And if I win or lose never mind
[01:47.35]As long as you’re my shelter every night
[01:51.44]I used to cry against a wall
[01:53.31]But now I’ve got a shoulder that I can lean on
[01:55.49]Swear to me you wont be gone
[01:59.35]I’m ready for the good times
[02:00.80]I’m ready for the good times
[02:03.35]Ready to get it on
[02:06.95]I’m ready for the good times
[02:08.80]I’m ready for the good times
[02:11.31]Now that I’m not alone
[02:46.96]Cause everyday theres a war to fight
[02:48.86]And if I win or lose never mind
[02:50.89]As long as you’re my shelter every night
[02:55.39]I used to cry against a wall
[02:56.75]But now I’ve got a shoulder that I can lean on
[02:58.90]Swear to me you wont be gone
[03:02.80]I’m ready for the good times
[03:04.26]I’m ready for the good times
[03:06.81]Ready to get it on
[03:10.23]I’m ready for the good times
[03:12.22]I’m ready for the good times
[03:14.31]Now that I’m not alone
