[00:15.06]I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
[00:19.22]I was lookin' for something I couldn't replace
[00:22.18]I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known
[00:29.64]And like a blind dog without a bone
[00:33.38]I was a gypsyu lost in the twilight zone
[00:36.50]
[00:37.02]I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
[00:44.74]I've been there, done that, I ain't lookin' that
[00:48.78]The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone...
[00:57.55]Who says you can't go home...
[00:59.18]
[00:59.74]Who says you can't go home
[01:02.90]There's only one place that call me one of their own
[01:06.10]Just a hometown boy, born a rolling-stone, who says you can't go home
[01:12.51]Who says you can't go back, been around all around the world and
[01:18.79]that's a matter of fact
[01:20.97]There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
[01:26.56]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright...
[01:31.94]
[01:35.00]I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
[01:38.63]There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
[01:42.43]I left a million mile of memories on that road
[01:49.79]And every step I take I know that I'm not alone
[01:52.88]You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
[01:57.08]These are my streets, the only life I've ever known, who says you can't go
[02:03.90]
[02:04.22]Who says you can't go home
[02:07.45]There's only one place that call me one of their own
[02:10.66]Just a hometown boy, born a rolling-stone, who says you can't go home
[02:18.65]Who says you can't go back, been around all around the world and
[02:23.73]that's a matter of fact
[02:26.50]There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
[02:33.13]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright...

[03:03.68]I've been there, done that, I ain't looking that
[03:07.36]It's been a long long road
[03:10.09]Feels like I've never left, that's how the story goes
[03:17.23]It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
[03:23.31]If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
[03:24.65]Take it in, take it with you when you go, who says you can't go home
[03:30.56]Who says you can't go home
[03:35.62]There's only one place that call me one of their own
[03:37.59]Who says you can't go home
[03:38.97]Just a hometown boy, born a rolling-stone, who says you can't go home
[03:45.37]Who says you can't go back, been around all around the world and
[03:53.97]that's a matter of fact
[03:55.36]There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
[03:59.90]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright...
[04:10.22]it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[04:16.01]Who says you can't go home
[04:17.88]t's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[04:21.38]Who says you can't go home
[04:24.82]t's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[04:30.50]Who says you can't go home
