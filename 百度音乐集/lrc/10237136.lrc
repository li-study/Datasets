[00:35.51]
[00:37.51]So you trying to do what they did
[00:41.52]Your friends that turn to liquid
[00:44.93]And got lost in the sea
[00:48.51]And now you're drowning me
[00:51.80]With your talk of full eat clovers
[00:55.83]You turn to rocks and no man
[00:59.30]To be the ambient harm
[01:03.00]But it's bruising your karma
[01:07.37]
[01:13.22]Oh I wish my arms were wider
[01:17.57]I wish that I could hide you
[01:20.94]So you can rest and repair
[01:24.45]Without the blanket of sorrow
[01:29.53]The thick and the grey
[01:33.11]Your blanket of wool
[01:36.26]So heavy and stain
[01:40.69]And it only weighs you down
[01:45.03]
[02:20.02]So you thought that getting sober
[02:24.03]Would mean your life was over
[02:27.62]I don't think it's that bad
[02:31.24]I don't think it's that sad
[02:34.60]Just you sleep a little baby
[02:38.08]Leave the world alone and later
[02:41.95]If you wake up alive
[02:45.68]That old blanket of sorrow
[02:50.22]Could be feathers and down
[02:54.14]Your blanket of wool
[02:57.74]Would leave you alone
[03:01.78]And I can love you till you drown
[03:07.46]
[03:50.55]Come to me let's drown
[03:54.50]
[04:08.49]Come baby let's drown
[04:15.85]In feathers and down
[04:20.49]
