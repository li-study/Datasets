[00:31.67]In worn out shoes
[00:35.53]With silver hair a ragged shirtAnd baggy pants
[00:41.67]He would do the old soft shoe
[00:47.32]He would jump so high
[00:49.81]Jump so high
[00:53.51]Then he lightly touch down
[00:58.98]
[01:01.43]He told me of the time he worked with
[01:04.40]Minstrel shows travelling
[01:07.96]Throughout the south
[01:10.84]
[01:11.54]He spoke with tears of fifteen years
[01:14.41]How his dog and he
[01:18.20]They would travel about.
[01:22.73]

[01:29.85]He up and died
[01:32.77]And after twenty years he still grieved
[01:36.14]
[01:37.90]He said "I dance now
[01:41.07]At every chance in the Honky Tonks
[01:45.06]For my drinks and tips
[01:47.86]
[01:48.54]But most the time I spend
[01:51.26]Behind these country bars
[01:54.92]You see on I drinks a bit"
[01:59.41]
[02:00.87]Then he shook his head
