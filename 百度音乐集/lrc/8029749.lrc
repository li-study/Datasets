[00:44.32]When the power chords come crashing down
[00:49.25]Go tearing through my senses
[00:52.45]It's for the strong, not for the weak
[00:55.99]In light and dark dimensions
[00:58.69]
[00:59.76]It stimulates, regenerates
[01:03.23]It's therapeutic healing
[01:07.01]It lifts our feet up off the ground
[01:10.45]and blasts us through the ceiling
[01:13.49]
[01:14.09]Between the eyes
[01:17.33]I hear it screaming
[01:21.13]And it electrifies
[01:24.54]Your inner feelings
[01:27.48]
[01:29.17]Hot shock waves charge the air
[01:32.79]All heads are banging
[01:36.45]Fists pumping everywhere
[01:39.87]Guitars are cranking
[01:43.18]
[01:44.90]Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
[01:50.33]What do you want
[01:52.16]Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
[01:57.42]What do you want
[01:58.89]
[01:59.35]Ten thousand lights come blazing down
[02:02.37]With razor sharp precision
[02:06.01]The speakers pour out molten steel
[02:09.49]The beat gives double vision
[02:12.46]
[02:13.27]An armour plated raging beast
[02:16.76]That's born of steel and leather
[02:20.24]It will survive against all odds
[02:23.59]Stampeding on forever
[02:26.98]
[02:27.37]Between the eyes
[02:30.90]I hear it screaming
[02:34.36]And it electrifies
[02:37.84]Your inner feelings
[02:39.74]
[02:42.62]Hot shock waves charge the air
[02:46.14]All heads are banging
[02:49.80]Fists pumping everywhere
[02:53.49]Guitars are cranking
[02:57.44]
[02:58.29]Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
