[00:20.62]
[00:22.11]Look at me,
[00:27.19]I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
[00:34.52]And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud,
[00:39.50]I can't understand
[00:43.27]I get misty,
[00:46.30]just holding your hand
[00:50.40]
[00:53.47]Walk my way
[00:58.70]And a thousand violins begin to play
[01:05.78]Or it might be the sound of your hello
[01:10.75]The music I hear,
[01:14.01]I get misty the moment you're near
[01:20.62]
[01:22.88]You can't  say that you're leading me on,
[01:30.35]But it's just what I want you to do
[01:37.85]Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost,
[01:45.39]That's why I'm following you
[01:50.98]
[01:54.13]On my own,
[01:58.78]Would I wander through this wonderland alone
[02:05.74]Never knowing my right foot from my left,
[02:10.18]My hat from my glove
[02:14.10]I'm too misty, and too much in love.

[02:54.56]On my own,
[02:58.23]Would I wander through this wonderland alone
[03:04.75]Never knowing my right foot from my left,
[03:09.33]My hat from my glove
[03:13.51]Too misty, and too much in love,
[03:23.83]Too misty, and too much in love
[03:39.04]In love
[03:46.26]In love
[03:52.58]
