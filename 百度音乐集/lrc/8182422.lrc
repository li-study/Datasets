[00:13.61]Tangled
[00:13.91]I'm full of regret
[00:17.55]For all things that I've done and said
[00:20.82]And I don't know if it'll ever be ok to show
[00:26.67]My face 'round here
[00:29.98]Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
[00:33.38]Would you ever turn your head and look
[00:38.23]See if I'm gone
[00:39.89]Cause I fear
[00:41.39]There is nothing left to say to you
[00:46.02]That you wanna hear
[00:47.49]That you wanna know
[00:48.67]I think I should go
[00:50.48]The things I've done are way too shameful
[01:00.31]Your just innocent
[01:03.61]A helpless victim of a spider's web
[01:06.30]And I'm an insect
[01:10.01]Goin after anything that I can get
[01:12.85]So you better turn your head and run
[01:17.43]And don't look back
[01:19.13]Cause I fear
[01:20.74]There is nothing left to say
[01:23.90]To you
[01:25.32]That you wanna hear
[01:26.75]That you wanna know
[01:28.11]I think I should go
[01:30.12]The things I've done are way too shameful
[01:35.64]And I've done you so wrong
[01:38.40]Treated you bad
[01:40.14]Strung you along
[01:41.36]Oh shame on myself
[01:43.61]I don't know how I got so tangled up
[02:26.76]
