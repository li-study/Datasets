[00:00.00]Nickel Creek - Tomorrow Is A Long Time
[00:07.72]
[00:09.72]If today was not an endless highway
[00:15.72]If tonight was not a crooked trail
[00:20.95]If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
[00:27.46]Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
[00:30.97]
[00:32.26]Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
[00:37.32]If I could hear his heart softly pounding
[00:42.14]Yes, and only if he was lying by me
[00:46.91]Would I lie in my bed once again
[00:54.02]
[01:01.91]I can't see my reflection in the waters
[01:08.24]I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
[01:13.07]I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
[01:19.30]Or remember the sound of my own name
[01:23.36]
[01:24.40]Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
[01:29.72]If I could hear his heart softly pounding
[01:34.38]Yes, and only if he was lying by me
[01:39.17]Would I lie in my bed once again
[01:46.64]
[02:36.76]There's beauty in that silver singing river
[02:42.58]There's beauty in that sunrise in the sky
[02:47.50]But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
[02:53.03]That I remember in my true love's eyes
[02:57.00]
[02:57.78]Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
[03:03.01]If I could hear his heart softly pounding
[03:07.75]Yes, and only if he was lying by me
[03:12.37]Would I lie in my bed once again
