[ti:LONGER]
[ar:Dan Fogelderg]

[02:31.05][00:23.50]Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
[02:36.45][00:29.43]Higer than any bird ever flew
[02:42.97][00:35.08]Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
[02:54.10][02:48.54][00:41.93]I've been in love with you
[00:46.93]Stronger than any mountain cathedral
[00:54.40]Truer than any tree ever grew
[01:00.30]Deeper than any forest primeval
[01:06.52]I am in love with you
[01:12.31]I'll bring fore in the winters
[01:18.14]You'll sent showers in the springs and summers
[01:24.62]We'll fly through the falls
[01:30.60]With love upon my wings
[01:37.72]Through the years
[01:38.40]As the fore starts to mellow
[01:42.41]Burnign lines in the book of our lives
[01:48.54]Though the binding cracks
[01:51.50]And the pages start to yellow
[01:54.36]I'll be in love with you
[01:57.50]I'll be in love with you
