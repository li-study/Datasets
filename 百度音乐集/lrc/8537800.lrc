[00:01.77]No Man's Land----Beverly Knight
[00:03.17]
[00:06.95]Surfing channels
[00:09.68]Trying to fool my feelings
[00:12.50]It's like they're still resisting
[00:15.56]Those little demons
[00:19.27]Trying to leave it
[00:21.88]But they keep on playing over again
[00:27.74]
[00:28.79]These 4 walls share my conversations
[00:34.26]Wish I could tell someone
[00:37.33]But my voice keeps breaking
[00:40.46]So ashamed you're still
[00:44.64]living rent free in my brain... in my brain
[00:51.89]
[00:52.22]I'm saying
[00:53.28]I can't move on... stumbling 'round
[00:59.31]Hanging on... but going down...
[01:05.43]No man's... no man's land
[01:15.63]
[01:18.48]People say
[01:20.17]Keep your head up
[01:21.54]Watch the sun rising
[01:24.68]Everybody has big advice for me
[01:30.75]But all I wanna know is
[01:35.01]What the hell went wrong... oh what went wrong
[01:41.74]
[01:42.06]I'm saying
[01:43.00]I can't move on... stumbling 'round
[01:49.09]Hanging on... but going down...
[01:55.21]No man's... no man's land
[02:03.93]
[02:04.44]No man's... no man's land
[02:12.06]But I will rise to start again
[02:15.84]I have no doubt
[02:19.38]But I just don't know when
[02:22.86]Sometimes I can change anything
[02:26.54]But then again...
[02:28.95]
[02:29.94]I'm saying
[02:32.08]I can't move on... stumbling 'round
[02:37.14]Hanging on... but going down...
[02:43.75]No man's... no man's land
[02:49.75]I'm saying
[02:53.56]I can't move on... stumbling 'round
[02:56.39]Hanging on... but going down...
[03:02.55]No man's... no man's land
