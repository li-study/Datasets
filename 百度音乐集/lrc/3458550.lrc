[00:34.82]You I love and not another
[00:41.30]And I know we'll always be together
[00:48.48]Some men have one love, two and three love
[00:55.56]Four and five and six love
[01:02.39]But I believe in one love

[01:23.24]Some men don't feel secure
[01:26.20]Unless they have a woman on each arm
[01:29.65]They have to play the field, prove they have charm
[01:36.56]They say don't lay your eggs in one basket
[01:43.58]If the basket should fall all your eggs'll be broken

[02:59.70]Ever so faithful ever so sure
[03:06.68]No man could ever ask for more
[03:11.79]I believe in one love
