[00:07.89]
[00:15.94]Dreaming
[00:18.78]I am only dreaming
[00:23.56]Of another place and time
[00:27.47]Where my family's from
[00:30.81]
[00:31.22]Singing
[00:34.20]I can hear them singing
[00:38.97]When the rain had washed away
[00:42.89]All these scattered dreams
[00:46.19]
[00:46.84]Dying
[00:49.74]Everyone's reminded
[00:54.52]Hearts are washed in misery
[00:58.46]Drenched in gasoline
[01:01.67]

[02:49.84]I'm just fucked up
[02:51.46]I got so high I can't stand up
[02:54.06]I'm not cursed cause I've been blessed
[02:57.48]I'm not in love cause I'm a mess
[03:02.08]
[03:03.38]Life refugees
[03:06.79]We're lost like refugees
[03:10.33]Like Refugees
[03:13.85]Were lost like refugees
[03:17.23]The brutality of reality
[03:20.77]Is the freedom that keeps me from
