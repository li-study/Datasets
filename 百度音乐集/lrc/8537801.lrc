[00:15.58]You will search, babe, at any cost,
[00:23.97]But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost ?
[00:33.51]Everybody will help you,
[00:42.42]Some people are very kind.
[00:50.19]But if I can save you any time,
[00:59.68]Come on, give it to me,
[01:04.60]I'll keep it with mine.
[01:10.21]
[01:16.17]I can't help it if you might think I am odd
[01:24.69]If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
[01:28.24]But for what you're not.
[01:34.24]Everybody will help you,
[01:45.29]Discover what you set out to find
[01:52.79]But if I can save you any time,
[02:02.25]Come on, give it to me,
[02:07.21]I'll keep it with mine.

[02:21.03]The train leaves at half past ten
[02:29.70]But it'll be back tomorrow same time again.
[02:37.73]The conductor, he's weary,
[02:43.20]Still stuck on the line.
[02:48.65]But if I can save you any time,
[02:58.01]Come on, give it to me,
[03:02.95]I'll keep it with mine.
