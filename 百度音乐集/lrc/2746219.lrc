[00:17.00]Everything But The Girl
[00:23.38]
[00:47.31]I walk the city late at night.
[00:56.74]does everyone here do the same
[01:04.63]I want to be the things I see,
[01:12.47]give every face and place my name.
[01:16.97]
[01:18.81]I cross the street, take a right,
[01:22.61]pick up the pace, pass a fight.
[01:26.40]Did I grow up just to stay home?
[01:30.35]I'm not immune---I love this tune.
[01:34.63]I wanna love more.
[01:38.05]I just wanna love more.
[01:42.35]I wanna love more.
[01:45.97]I just wanna love more.
[01:49.94]I wanna love more.
[01:53.80]I just wanna love more.
[01:58.15]I wanna love more.
[02:01.65]I just wanna love more.
[02:04.68]
[02:07.52]I drag the city late at night.
[02:15.38]It's in my mouth, it's in my hair.
[02:21.77]the people fill the city
[02:25.77]because the city fills the people, oh yeah.
[02:31.17]
[02:37.39]I cross the street, avoid the freeze
[02:41.20]a city's warmer by a couple of degrees.
[02:45.19]the smell of food, the smell of rain.
[02:48.96]I'm not immune---I love this tune.
[02:53.21]I wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[02:56.76]I just wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:01.24]I wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:04.69]I just wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:08.96]I wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:12.54]I just wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:16.89]I wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:20.41]I just wanna love more. (there's a river in my head.)
[03:24.50]
[03:34.14]the only way out is down.
[03:43.31]
[03:49.91]the only way up is down.
[03:55.87]
[04:12.54]the days roll by like thunder
[04:15.58]like a storm that's never breaking,
[04:19.75]all my time and space compressed
[04:23.18]in the low pressure proceedings,
[04:27.38]and they beat against the sides of my life,
[04:35.30]and the roads all lead behind me,
[04:39.30]so I wrap the wheel around me and
[04:43.21]I go out. (there's a river in my head.)
[04:57.42]
[04:59.02]I'll take you home and make it easy.
[05:06.82]I'll take you home and make it easy.
[05:15.48]love more...
