[00:02.00]The Veronicas - Goodbye To You
[00:07.00]
[00:17.56]Those times I waited for you seem so long ago
[00:23.94]I wanted you far too much to ever let you go
[00:29.83]You know you never got by "I feel it too"
[00:33.02]And I guess I never could stand to lose
[00:36.07]It's such a pity to say
[00:37.84]Goodbye to you
[00:40.98]Goodbye to you
[00:44.31]Goodbye to you
[00:46.95]Goodbye to you
[00:50.92]Could I have loved someone like the one I see in you
[00:56.54]I remember the good times baby now, and the bad times too
[01:02.37]These last few weeks of holding on
[01:05.80]The days are dull, the nights are long
[01:08.83]Guess it's better to say
[01:10.74]Goodbye to you
[01:13.70]Goodbye to you
[01:16.55]Goodbye to you
[01:19.45]Goodbye to you
[01:23.01]'Cause baby it's over now
[01:26.57]No need to talk about it
[01:29.79]It's not the same
[01:32.84]My love for you's just not the same
[01:35.87]And my heart, and my heart
[01:39.21]And my heart can't stand the strain
[01:42.79]And my love, and my love
[01:45.52]And my love...
[01:59.12]And my love...
[02:05.25]Goodbye to you
[02:08.54]Goodbye to you
[02:11.91]Goodbye to you
[02:14.81]Goodbye to you
[02:18.24]Now, could I have loved someone
[02:21.11]like the one I see in you
[02:24.76]Yeah, I remember the good times baby now,
[02:27.62]and the bad times too
[02:30.56]These last few weeks of holding on
[02:33.82]The days are dull, the nights are long
[02:36.87]Guess it's better to say
[02:39.16]Goodbye to you
[02:41.96]Goodbye to you
[02:44.83]Goodbye to you
[02:47.64]Goodbye to you
[03:02.85]Goodbye to you
