[00:11.50]Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
[00:15.50]Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
[00:19.70]I tore it apart
[00:22.20]And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
[00:26.20]And no woman in the world deserves this
[00:28.55]But here I am asking you for one more chance
[00:33.50]Can we fall, one more time?
[00:39.04]Stop the tape and rewind
[00:44.39]Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
[00:50.52]Cause there is nobody else
[00:55.87]It's gotta be you
[01:01.39]Only you
[01:07.00]It's gotta be you
[01:12.40]Only you
[01:18.60]
[01:24.30]Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
[01:28.20]When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
[01:32.84]You've almost had enough
[01:35.66]And your actions speak louder than words
[01:39.28]And you're about to break from all you've heard
[01:42.00]Don't be scared, I ain't going no where
[01:47.00]I'll be here, by your side
[01:52.33]No more fears, no more crying
[01:57.65]But if you walk away
[02:00.98]I know I'll fade
[02:03.77]Cause there is nobody else
[02:08.56]It's gotta be you
[02:15.07]Only you
[02:20.63]It's gotta be you
[02:26.23]Only you
[02:32.05]Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
[02:35.92]One more, one more, can we try?
[02:39.12]One more, one more time
[02:42.10]I'll make it better
[02:44.82]One more, one more, can we try?
[02:48.02]One more, one more,
[02:50.04]Can we try one more time to make it all better?
[02:54.61]Cos its gotta be you
[03:00.40]Its gotta be you
[03:06.10]Only you
[03:12.19]Only you
[03:17.35]It's gotta be you
[03:23.56]Only you

[03:34.36]Only you!
