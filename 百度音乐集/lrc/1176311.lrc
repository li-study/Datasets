[00:28.30]Before I hung up the phone all I could hear
[00:33.20]Was the dial tone ring in my ear
[00:37.07]If I could go back in time
[00:40.74]I'd say those three words
[00:44.20]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[00:48.53]And this can't be saved if you can't be found
[00:53.57]You hung up and left me for dead on the ground
[00:57.68]You didn't even say goodbye
[01:01.18]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[01:04.80]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[01:06.37]
[01:17.81]Now that you're gone I'm wasting away
[01:20.72]The life has been siphoned right out of my veins
[01:22.72]If I could go back in time
[01:26.69]I'd say those three words
[01:32.22]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[01:35.34]And this can't be saved if you can't be found
[01:38.98]You hung up and left me for dead on the ground
[01:42.79]You didn't even say goodbye
[01:45.95]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[01:47.29]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[01:53.17]
[01:59.51]When you said those three words
[02:01.82]I kinda freaked out
[02:14.58]When you said them first my jaw hit the ground
[02:14.91]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[02:18.15]And this can't be saved if you can't be found
[02:27.49]You hung up and left me for dead on the ground
[02:31.60]You didn't even say goodbye
[02:41.00]And this can't be saved
[02:43.79]And this can't be saved
[02:46.53]If you can't be found
[02:47.35]If you can't be found
[02:51.31]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
[02:55.59]I shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
