[00:23.74]歌曲：The Riddle
[00:57.86]I got two strong arms
[01:00.46]Blessings of Babylon
[01:02.64]With time to carry on and try
[01:05.05]For sins and false alarms
[01:07.91]So to America the brave
[01:10.20]
[01:12.08]Wise men save
[01:13.64]Near a tree by a river
[01:15.43]There's a hole in the ground
[01:17.43]Where an old man of Aran
[01:19.20]Goes around and around
[01:21.25]And his mind is a beacon
[01:23.26]In the veil of the night
[01:24.78]For a strange kind of fashion
[01:26.70]There's a wrong and a right
[01:27.90]
[01:28.88]Near a tree by a river
[01:30.62]There's a hole in the ground
[01:32.25]Where an old man of Aran
[01:34.28]Goes around and around
[01:36.65]And his mind is a beacon
[01:38.83]In the veil of the night
[01:42.56]There's a wrong and a right
[01:44.59]But he'll never
[01:45.67]Never fight over you
[01:48.56](break)
[02:05.23]Near a tree by a river
[02:06.93]There's a hole in the ground
[02:08.81]Where an old man of Aran
[02:10.64]Goes around and around
[02:12.45]And his mind is a beacon
[02:14.55]In the veil of the night
[02:16.54]For a strange kind of fashion
[02:18.10]There's a wrong and a right
[02:19.08]
[02:19.34]Near a tree by a river
[02:21.16]There's a hole in the ground
[02:22.81]Where an old man of Aran
[02:24.73]Goes around and around
[02:26.70]And his mind is a beacon
[02:28.76]In the veil of the night
[02:30.39]For a strange kind of fashion
[02:32.29]There's a wrong and a right
[02:34.32]But he'll never
[02:34.80]Never fight over you
[02:37.35]
[02:55.91]I got plans for us
[02:59.19]Nights in the scullery
[03:01.07]And days instead of me
[03:03.43]I only know what to discuss
[03:06.83]Of for anything but light
[03:10.51]Wise men fighting over you
[03:13.32]
[03:14.03]It's not me you see
[03:16.55]Pieces of valentine
[03:18.55]With just a song of mine
[03:20.50]To keep from burning history
[03:24.21]Seasons of gasoline and gold
[03:26.70]
[03:27.98]Wise men fold
[03:29.84]Near a tree by a river
[03:31.71]There's a hole in the ground
[03:33.33]Where an old man of Aran
[03:35.28]Goes around and around
[03:37.09]And his mind is a beacon
[03:39.27]In the veil of the night
[03:41.05]For a strange kind of fashion
[03:43.13]There's a wrong and a right
[03:45.06]But he'll never
[03:45.50]Never fight over you
[03:47.89]
[03:48.68]I got time to kill
[03:50.81]Sly looks in corridors
[03:52.78]Without a plan of yours
[03:54.67]A blackbird sings on bluebird hill
[03:58.63]Thanks to the calling of the wild
[04:01.81]
[04:02.67]Wise men's child...
