[00:01.49]breakaway
[00:19.03]Grew up in a small town
[00:21.23]And when the rain would fall down
[00:23.62]I just stared out my window
[00:28.10]Dreaming of what could be
[00:30.16]And if I'd end up happy
[00:32.20]I would pray (I would pray)
[00:37.08]Trying not to reach out
[00:39.22]But when I'd try to speak out
[00:41.57]Felt like no one could hear me
[00:46.09]Wanted to belong here
[00:48.10]But something felt so wrong here
[00:50.20]So I pray (I would pray)
[00:53.96]I could breakaway
[01:01.41]I'll spread my wings
[01:02.97]and I'll learn how to fly
[01:05.72]I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
[01:10.76]And I'll make a wish
[01:11.87]Take a chance
[01:13.00]Make a change
[01:14.61]And breakaway
[01:19.40]Out of the darkness and into the sun
[01:23.82]But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
[01:28.25]I'll take a risk
[01:29.71]Take a chance
[01:30.82]Make a change
[01:32.60]And breakaway
[01:46.96]Wanna feel the warm breeze
[01:49.10]Sleep under a palm tree
[01:51.42]Feel the rush of the ocean
[01:55.92]Get onboard a fast train
[01:58.12]Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
[02:04.27]And breakaway
[02:11.22]I'll spread my wings
[02:12.75]and I'll learn how to fly
[02:15.52]I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
[02:20.21]And I'll make a wish
[02:21.63]Take a chance
[02:22.81]Make a change
[02:24.56]And breakaway
[02:29.17]Out of the darkness and into the sun
[02:33.56]But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
[02:38.54]I'll take a risk
[02:39.69]Take a chance
[02:40.77]Make a change
[02:42.60]And breakaway
[02:47.13]Buildings with a hundred floors
[02:49.85]Swinging around revolving doors
[02:52.13]Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
[02:56.63]Gotta keep moving on, moving on
[02:59.91]Fly away, breakaway
[03:05.16]I'll spread my wings
[03:06.98]And I'll learn how to fly
[03:09.73]Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
[03:14.38]I gotta take a risk
[03:15.68]Take a chance
[03:17.06]Make a change
[03:18.25]And breakaway
[03:23.11]Out of the darkness and into the sun
[03:27.58]But I won't forget the place I come from
[03:32.15]I gotta take a risk
[03:33.47]Take a chance
[03:34.62]Make a change
[03:36.33]And breakaway,
[03:40.92]breakaway,
[03:45.74]breakaway
