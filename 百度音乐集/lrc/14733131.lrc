[00:02.10]Shooting Star
[00:04.10]Owl City
[00:06.16]
[00:17.36]Close your tired eyes, relaxing them.
[00:21.17]Count from 1 to 10 and open them.
[00:24.96]All these heavy thoughts will
[00:27.70]try to weigh you down, but not this time.
[00:31.44]
[00:32.77]Way up in the air, you're finally free,
[00:36.78]and you can stay up there, right next to me.
[00:40.48]All this gravity
[00:43.01]will try to pull you down, but not this time.
[00:46.64]
[00:47.36]When the sun goes down,
[00:49.32] and the lights burn out,
[00:51.03]Then it's time for you to shine.
[00:54.59]Brighter than the shooting star,
[00:58.56]so shine no matter where you are.
[01:02.72]Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,
[01:06.54]'cause it's time for you to shine.
[01:09.96]Brighter than a shooting star,
[01:14.05]so shine no matter where you are, tonight.
[01:19.67]
[01:20.67]Wooh, wooh, wooh.
[01:25.55]Brighter than a shooting star,
[01:29.37]Shine no matter where you are, tonight.
[01:34.98]
[01:35.25]Gazing through my eyes,
[01:36.98]when the fire starts,
[01:38.62]And fan the flame so hot,
[01:41.06] it melt our hearts.
[01:42.40]All the pouring rain,
[01:44.88] will try to put it out, but not this time.
[01:48.85]
[01:50.27]Let your colours burn,
[01:52.67]and brightly burst, into a million sparks,
[01:56.06]but all dispursed and illuminate a world,
[02:00.17]That'll try to bring you down,
[02:02.25]But not this time.
[02:04.22]
[02:04.64]When the sun goes down,
[02:06.96]and the lights burn out,
[02:08.44]Then it's time for you to shine.
[02:12.18]Brighter than the shooting star,
[02:15.92]so shine no matter where you are.
[02:20.22]Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,
[02:23.84]'cause it's time for you to shine.
[02:27.47]Brighter than a shooting star,
[02:31.40]so shine no matter where you are, tonight.
[02:37.17]
[02:37.94]Wooh, wooh, wooh.
[02:43.29]Brighter than a shooting star,
[02:46.64]Shine no matter where you are, tonight.
[02:52.26]
[02:52.70]A thousand heartbeats beating time,
[02:56.62]and makes this dark planet come alive.
[03:00.29]So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine.
[03:09.33]
[03:10.61]When the sun goes down,
[03:12.60]and the lights burn out,
[03:14.24]Then it's time for you to shine.
[03:17.77]Brighter than the shooting star,
[03:21.72]so shine no matter where you are.
[03:25.97]Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,
[03:29.76]'cause it's time for you to shine.
[03:33.27]Brighter than a shooting star,
[03:37.17]so shine no matter where you are, tonight.
[03:42.75]
[03:43.17]Wooh, wooh, wooh.
[03:48.80]Brighter than a shooting star,
[03:52.66]Shine no matter where you are, tonight.
