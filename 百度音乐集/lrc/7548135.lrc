[00:00.00]Maroon 5 - Back At Your Door
[00:05.00]
[00:07.96]From the moment the lights went off
[00:11.09]Everything had changed
[00:14.37]Lie awake in an empty room
[00:16.99]In my head it all feels the same
[00:19.27]
[00:20.81]Like the taste of the day you left
[00:23.48]It still lingers on my breath
[00:27.13]And the dampness of tears that left
[00:29.96]That stain where you had wept
[00:32.20]
[00:33.70]All alone with the negligee
[00:36.31]That still hangs off of my bed
[00:40.47]I keep meaning to give it away
[00:43.01]But I just leave it there instead
[00:45.75]
[00:47.31]No need to cry about it
[00:50.46]I cannot live without it
[00:52.79]Every time I wind up back at your door
[00:58.57]
[00:59.78]Why do you do this to me?
[01:02.95]You penetrate right through me
[01:05.69]Every time I wind up back at your door
[01:11.04]
[01:12.42]3 more days ‘til I see your face
[01:14.82]I’m afraid it’s far too much
[01:18.74]Cook a meal and fix up the place
[01:21.21]Dial your number, hang it up
[01:23.70]
[01:25.26]If I took you for granted
[01:27.24]I apologise for acting tough
[01:31.56]You’re my reason for living
[01:33.40]And there’s no way I’m giving up, oh
[01:37.59]
[01:38.24]No need to cry about it
[01:41.45]I cannot live without it
[01:44.24]Every time I wind up back at your door
[01:49.71]
[01:51.17]Why do you do this to me?
[01:54.41]You penetrate right through me
[01:56.98]Every time I wind up back at your door
[02:02.55]
[02:03.35]Now every evening is a bitter fight
[02:09.49]And I’m eating all alone on a Friday night
[02:15.49]And I know what your friends say
[02:19.03]“He’s just wasting your love and time”
[02:22.72]I will never let you change your mind
[02:29.29]
[02:30.23]No need to cry about it
[02:33.27]I cannot live without it
[02:35.98]Every time I wind up back at your door
[02:41.43]
[02:43.04]Why do you do this to me?
[02:46.24]You penetrate right through me
[02:48.73]Every time I wind up back at your door
[02:54.39]
[02:55.93]No need to cry about it
[02:59.06]I may just die without it
[03:01.63]Every time I wind up back at your door
[03:07.27]
[03:08.68]Why do you do this to me?
[03:11.74]You penetrate right through me
[03:14.85]Every time I wind up back at your door
[03:20.48]
[03:21.16]Every time I wind up back at your door
[03:26.92]Every time I wind up back at your door
[03:34.34]
[03:46.35]-----END-----
