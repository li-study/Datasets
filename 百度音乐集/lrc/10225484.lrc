[00:07.95]I'm Sorry
[00:08.69]John Denver
[00:10.34]
[00:14.91]It's cold here in the city
[00:18.41]It always seems that way
[00:21.71]And I've been thinking about you almost everyday
[00:28.21]Thinking about the good times
[00:31.71]Thinking about the rain
[00:35.10]Thinking about how bad it feels alone again
[00:40.32]
[00:41.66]I'm sorry for the way things are in China
[00:48.41]I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
[00:55.58]But more than anything else
[00:58.91]I'm sorry for myself
[01:05.25]'Cause you're not here with me
[01:08.60]
[01:09.42]Our friends all ask about you
[01:13.01]I say you're doing fine
[01:16.56]And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
[01:23.33]But they all know I'm crying
[01:26.44]And I can't sleep at night
[01:30.13]They all know I'm dying down deep inside
[01:35.41]
[01:36.97]I'm sorry for all the lies I told you
[01:43.97]I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
[01:50.86]But more than anything else
[01:54.22]I'm sorry for myself
[02:00.69]I can't believe you went away
[02:05.64]
[02:19.00]I'm sorry if I took some things for granted
[02:25.90]I'm sorry for the chains I put on you
[02:32.85]But more than anything else
[02:36.20]I'm sorry for myself
[02:42.64]For living without you
