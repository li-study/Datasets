[00:11.73]First time I saw you
[00:14.80]You looked at me and
[00:17.04]I could barely breathe
[00:21.21]Couldn\'t keep my eyes off you
[00:24.72]There was something in you
[00:27.34]that did something to me
[00:31.16]I just knew I had to know your name
[00:36.54]There was something about you,
[00:38.85]babe And I said
[00:40.45]I want some of that
[00:42.96]I need some of that
[00:45.28]Yes, I\'d love some of that love
[00:47.57]you\'ve got, baby
[00:50.56]I crave some of that
[00:52.77]Wanna taste some of that
[00:55.32]Won\'t you give some of that love
[00:57.71]to me, baby
[01:02.60]I walked behind you
[01:05.99]Watching each move that your body made
[01:11.73]Wished I was walking beside you
[01:15.54]There was something in you
[01:18.01]that stole my heart away
[01:22.43]I just knew I needed you so bad
[01:27.32]You had something I had to have
[01:30.17]And I thought
[01:31.22]I want some of that
[01:33.72]I need some of that
[01:36.05]Yes, I\'d love some of that love
[01:38.35]you\'ve got, baby
[01:41.37]I crave some of that
[01:43.52]Wanna taste some of that
[01:46.09]Won\'t you give some of that love
[01:48.52]to me, baby
[01:52.84]Want some of that love
[01:55.36]Need some of that love
[01:57.88]Love some of that love
[02:02.92]You were everything
[02:04.83]that I wanted next to me
[02:07.05]What could I do
[02:08.96]I had to get with you
[02:12.79]Get you into my life
[02:18.95]Now you\'re here with me
[02:21.66]And I see that look in your eyes tonight
[02:28.02]I know you can\'t wait to kiss me
[02:31.74]No it won\'t be too long
[02:34.29]\'till I\'m holding you tight
[02:38.68]In a moment you\'ll reach out for me
[02:43.72]And that moment will be so sweet
[02:46.61]When you say
[02:47.63]I want some of that
[02:49.98]I need some of that
[02:52.23]Yes, I\'d love some of that love
[02:54.57]you\'ve got, baby
[02:57.48]I crave some of that
[02:59.73]Wanna taste some of that
[03:02.26]Won\'t you give some of that love
[03:04.64]to me, baby
[03:07.90]I want some of that
[03:10.29]I need some of that
[03:12.51]Yes, I\'d love some of that love
[03:14.90]you\'ve got, baby
[03:17.95]I crave some of that
[03:20.06]Wanna taste some of that
[03:22.57]Won\'t you give some of that love
