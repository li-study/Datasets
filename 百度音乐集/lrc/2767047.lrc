[00:01.48]Judy Garland
[00:01.63]
[00:02.09]Somewhere over the rainbow
[00:10.15]Way up high,
[00:17.55]There's a land that I heard of
[00:28.38]Once in a lullaby.
[00:32.04]
[00:35.30]Somewhere over the rainbow
[00:43.45]Skies are blue,
[00:50.78]And the dreams that you dare to dream
[01:00.25]Really do come true.
[01:05.20]
[01:06.86]Someday I'll wish upon a star
[01:11.22]And wake up where the clouds are far
[01:16.38]Behind me.
[01:24.53]Where troubles melt like lemon drops
[01:31.66]Away above the chimney tops
[01:37.84]That's where you'll find me.
[01:49.59]
[01:50.09]Somewhere over the rainbow
[01:59.90]Bluebirds fly.
[02:06.63]Birds fly over the rainbow.
[02:16.76]Why then, oh why can't I
[02:28.87]
[02:46.56]If happy little bluebirds fly
[02:56.26]Beyond the rainbow
[03:03.65]Why, oh why can't I
[03:29.58]
