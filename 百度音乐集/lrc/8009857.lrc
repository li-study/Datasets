[00:00.05]送给阳阳
[00:00.06]
[00:06.80]it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
[00:14.50]i'm not one of those, who can easily hide
[00:22.00]i don't have much money, but boy if i did
[00:29.00]i'd buy a big house where we both could live
[00:36.00]
[00:38.75]if i was a sculptor, huh, but then again no
[00:44.70]or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
[00:53.00]i know it's not much, but it's the best i can do
[00:59.90]my gift is my song, and this one's for you
[01:07.00]
[01:08.80]and you can tell everybody, this is your song
[01:16.50]it may be quite simple, but now it's done
[01:23.60]i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
[01:27.50]that i put down in words
[01:30.50]
[01:31.40]how wonderful life is while you're in the world
[01:40.00]
[01:49.90]i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
[01:56.00]well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
[02:03.92]but the sun's been quite kind while i wrote this song
[02:11.60]it's for people like you, that keep it turned on
[02:17.10]
[02:20.31]so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do
[02:27.90]you see i've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
[02:34.80]anyway the thing is, what i really mean
[02:42.50]yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen
[02:48.50]
[02:51.50]and you can tell everybody, this is your song
[02:58.42]it may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[03:05.50]i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
[03:09.50]that i put down in words
[03:13.20]
[03:14.20]how wonderful life is while you're in the world
[03:21.00]
[03:24.10]i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
[03:28.00]that i put down in words
[03:31.00]
[03:32.80]how wonderful life is while you're in the world
[03:40.50]
[03:42.00]阳阳，我爱你
