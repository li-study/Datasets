[00:02.00]Suzanne Vega - Marlene On The Wall
[00:04.00]
[02:31.92][00:09.32]Even if I am in love with you
[02:34.24][00:11.97]All this to say, what's it to you?
[02:36.58][00:14.23]Observe the blood, the rose tattoo
[02:38.90][00:16.53]Of the fingerprints on me from you
[02:41.42][00:19.44]Other evidence has shown
[02:43.89][00:21.49]That you and I are still alone
[02:46.15][00:24.03]We skirt around the danger zone
[02:48.44][00:26.26]And don't talk about it later
[03:24.61][03:00.78][02:03.24][01:16.29][00:28.96]Marlene watches from the wall
[03:26.89][03:03.24][02:06.14][01:19.16][00:31.62]Her mocking smile says it all
[03:29.46][03:05.73][02:08.76][01:21.40][00:33.98]As she records the rise and fall
[02:11.20][00:36.21]Of every soldier passing
[02:13.51][00:38.66]But the only soldier now is me
[03:36.48][03:12.65][02:15.75][01:28.30][00:40.89]I'm fighting things I cannot see
[03:38.71][03:15.02][02:18.05][01:30.66][00:43.22]I think it's called my destiny
[03:41.14][03:17.78][02:20.83][01:33.27][00:45.85]That I am changing
[03:44.09][02:23.55][01:35.74][00:48.06]Marlene on the wall
[00:55.88]I walk to your house in the afternoon
[00:59.17]By the butcher shot with the sawdust strewn
[01:01.55]"Don't give away the goods too soon"
[01:04.09]Is what she might have told me
[02:50.71][01:06.47]And I tried so hard to resist
[02:53.32][01:08.91]When you held me in your handsome fist
[02:55.63][01:11.50]And reminded me of the night we kissed
[02:57.89][01:13.52]And of why I should be leaving
[03:31.82][03:08.04][01:23.72]Of every man who's been here
[03:34.16][03:10.39][01:26.05]But the only one here now is me
