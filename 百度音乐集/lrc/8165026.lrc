[00:00.00]Poison - Every Rose Has Its Thorn
[00:05.00]
[00:18.22]we both lie silently still
[00:20.93]In the dead of the night
[00:24.64]Although we both lie close together
[00:27.79]We feel miles apart inside
[00:30.57]
[00:31.42]Was it something i said or something i did
[00:34.49]Did my words not come out right
[00:38.19]Though i tried not to hurt you
[00:41.16]Though i tried
[00:43.38]But i guess that's why they say
[00:45.55]
[00:45.77]Every rose has its thorn
[00:51.42]Just like every night has its dawn
[00:58.54]Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
[01:06.00]Every rose has its thorn
[01:11.69]Yeah it does
[01:11.74]
[01:13.15]... SOLO ...
[01:23.52]
[01:26.64]I listen to our favorite song
[01:29.06]Playing on the radio
[01:33.09]Hear the dj say loves a game of easy come and
[01:37.78]Easy go
[01:39.82]But i wonder does he know
[01:43.25]Has he ever felt like this
[01:46.65]And i know that you'd be here right now
[01:50.20]If i could have let you know somehow
[01:53.42]I guess
[01:53.87]
[01:53.92]Every rose has its thorn
[02:00.02]Just like every night has its dawn
[02:07.07]Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
[02:14.48]Every rose has its thorn
[02:20.80]
[02:21.96]Though it's been a while now
[02:24.38]I can still feel so much pain
[02:28.50]Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
[02:32.08]But the scar, that scar remains
[02:37.70]
[02:38.63]... Solo ...
[03:05.82]
[03:16.78]I know i could have saved a love that night
[03:19.30]If i'd known what to say
[03:23.49]Instead of makin' love
[03:26.02]We both made our separate ways
[03:28.99]
[03:29.63]But now i hear you found somebody new
[03:33.37]And that i never meant that much to you
[03:36.75]To hear that tears me up inside
[03:40.26]And to see you cuts me like a knife
[03:42.69]I guess
[03:43.69]Every rose has its thorn
[03:49.13]Just like every night has its dawn
[03:56.57]Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
[04:04.28]Every rose has its thorn
[04:13.17]
