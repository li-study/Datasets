[00:04.00]Broken Hearted Me
[00:08.00]
[00:13.93]Every now and then I cry
[00:19.82]Every night, you keep staying on my mind
[00:28.60]All my friends say I'll survive
[00:33.43]It just takes time
[00:38.26]But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
[00:45.43]No I don't see how it can, when it's broken all apart
[00:52.16]A million miracles could never stop the pain
[00:58.07]Or put all the pieces together again
[01:06.02]No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
[01:12.51]No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
[01:19.67]And when you hear this song I hope that you will see
[01:25.45]That time won't heal a broken hearted me
[01:35.33]
[01:47.25]Everything is just the same
[01:52.35]Playing games, different loves, different names
[02:00.78]They keep saying I'll survive, it just take time
[02:24.77]A million miracles could never stop the pain
[02:30.92]Or put all the pieces together again
[02:38.58][02:11.04]No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
[02:45.45][02:17.88]No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
[02:52.24]When you hear this song , I hope that you will see
[02:57.71]That time won't heal a broken hearted
[03:05.43]Tine won't heal a broken hearted me
[03:17.14]
