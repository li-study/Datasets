[00:07.08]We heard first from you
[00:10.39]and then in the papers
[00:12.26]and the radio said 3pm
[00:15.97]when all of people
[00:19.56]crowded around at the stakes
[00:24.81]just yards from the lake
[00:27.74]
[00:28.66]But we heard you say
[00:32.04]that nobody know about
[00:34.97]the dangers and all the stages
[00:37.83]opened up an appalling line
[00:42.16]of people waiting in vain

[01:02.13]where movies stars were old
[01:05.64]and made up to seem like
[01:09.36]they were only seventeen

[01:27.44]when the flames came out
[01:29.83]and people started to shout
[01:32.16]that some had fallen and still lay down
[01:35.99]their faces dark from the flames
[01:40.49]the news had read out the names
[01:43.30]
