[00:10.00]Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
[00:13.00]I'm Exposed
[00:14.00]And it's no big surprise
[00:18.00]Don't you think I know
[00:19.00]Exactly where I stand
[00:22.00]This world is forcing me
[00:24.00]To hold your hand
[00:26.00]'Cause I'm just a girl, little ol' me
[00:31.00]Don't let me out of your signt
[00:36.00]I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
[00:40.00]So don't let me have any rights
[00:45.00]Oh... I've had it up to here!
[00:49.00]
[00:54.00]The moment that I step outside
[00:57.00]So many reasons
[00:59.00]For me to run and hide
[01:02.00]I can't do the little things
[01:04.00]I hold so dear
[01:06.00]'Cause it's all those little things
[01:09.00]That I fear
[01:10.00]
[01:11.00]'Cause I'm just a girl,
[01:13.00]I'd rather not be
[01:15.00]'Cause they won't let me drive
[01:18.00]Late at night
[01:20.00]I'm just a girl,
[01:22.00]Guess I'm some kind of freak
[01:24.00]'Cause they all sit and stare
[01:26.00]With their eyes
[01:29.00]I'm just a girl,
[01:31.00]Take a good look at me
[01:33.00]Just your typical prototype
[01:38.00]Oh... I've had it up to here!
[01:43.00]
[02:00.00]Oh... am I making myself clear?
[02:06.00]
[02:09.00]I'm just a girl
[02:14.00]I'm just a girl in the world...
[02:18.00]That's all that you'll let me be!
[02:22.00]I'm just a girl, living in captivity
[02:26.00]Your rule of thumb
[02:28.00]Makes me worry some
[02:31.00]I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
[02:35.00]What I've succumbed to
[02:37.00]Is making me numb
[02:40.00]I'm just a girl, my apologies
[02:44.00]What I've become, is so burdensome
[02:49.00]I'm just a girl, lucky me
[02:54.00]Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
[02:58.00]Oh... I've had it up to!
[03:02.00]Oh... I've had it up to!!
[03:07.00]Oh... I've had it up to here.
