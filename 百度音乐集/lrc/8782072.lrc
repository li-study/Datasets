[00:29.82]Always thought your promise was for life
[00:36.70]I did not think that I
[00:40.34]Would hear you say good-bye
[00:45.76]And I always heard you led another life
[00:51.34]I doubted every time
[00:55.24]I guess my love was blind
[01:00.49]Cause in my eyes
[01:04.38]Love was always something magical
[01:11.78]But the feeling is so tragic for
[01:18.78]And all I know is in love
[01:26.99]The thing that I want most I can't possess
[01:33.99]There's only emptiness
[01:39.67]In the late of night
[01:45.30]Just before I closed my eyes
[01:49.57]You lied
[01:52.93]As you kissed me goodnight
[01:56.59]In the late of night
[02:00.28]Just before I closed my eyes I cried
[02:08.09]As you kissed my lips good-bye
[02:39.36]In my eyes
[02:45.67]You will always be the lucky one
[02:53.22]Cause you know you'll always have my love
[03:00.88]For all time until I die
[03:08.17]Through the end I gave to you my best
[03:15.06]You gave, you gave me loneliness
[03:21.58]In the late of night
[03:30.35]Just before I closed my eyes
[03:34.19]You lied
[03:37.78]As you kissed me goodnight
[03:41.53]In the late of night
[03:45.25]Just before I closed my eyes I cried
[03:52.73]As you kissed my lips good-bye
