[00:03.50]Leaving on a Jet Plane
[00:08.23]Peter, Paul and Mary
[00:09.83]
[00:12.03]All my bags are packed,
[00:14.17]I'm ready to go
[00:15.90]I'm standing here outside your door
[00:19.41]I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
[00:25.25]
[00:26.32]But the dawn is breaking,
[00:28.95]It's early morn
[00:30.51]The taxi's waiting,
[00:32.28]He's blowing' his horn
[00:34.06]Already I'm so lonesome
[00:37.16]I could cry.
[00:40.01]
[00:40.91]So kiss me and smile for me
[00:44.39]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[00:48.33]Hold me like you'll never let me go.
[00:55.13]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[00:59.48]I don't know when I'll be back again
[01:04.12]Oh, babe, I hate to go.
[01:08.56]
[01:09.62]There are so many times I've let you down
[01:13.49]So many times I've played around
[01:17.10]I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
[01:23.02]
[01:24.15]Every place I go, I'll think of you
[01:27.73]Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
[01:31.38]When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring.
[01:37.55]
[01:38.96]So kiss me and smile for me
[01:42.46]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[01:46.15]Hold me like you'll never let me go.
[01:53.00]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[01:57.43]I don't know when I'll be back again
[02:01.93]Oh, babe, I hate to go.
[02:05.96]
[02:08.00]Now the time has come to leave you
[02:11.56]One more time
[02:13.48]Let me kiss you
[02:15.79]Then close your eyes,
[02:18.53]I'll be on my way.
[02:21.84]
[02:23.33]Dream about the days to come
[02:26.07]When I won't have to leave alone
[02:29.86]About the times, I won't have to say,
[02:36.63]
[02:37.75]So kiss me and smile for me
[02:41.15]Tell me that you'll wait for me
[02:44.76]Hold me like you'll never let me go.
[02:51.71]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[02:56.10]I don't know when I'll be back again
[02:59.58]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[03:03.49]I don't know when I'll be back again
[03:06.77]I'm leaving on a jet plane
[03:10.56]I don't know when I'll be back again
[03:15.33]Oh baby, I hate to go
[03:25.34]END........
