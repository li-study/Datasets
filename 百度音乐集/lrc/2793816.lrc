[00:02.00]Bombay Bicycle Club - My God
[00:04.00]
[00:11.08]All the highs are downwards
[00:16.60]All your fumble words are spent
[00:22.66]Paying no attention
[00:27.73]To the thoughts of your dear friend
[01:26.73][00:35.70]No point louder
[01:32.50][00:40.71]The sound of my power
[01:38.27][00:46.79]Sink in deeper
[01:44.06][00:52.31]Further each hour
[00:56.77]My God
[01:03.05]When our flower's fading
[01:07.76]When our stem begins to fold
[01:14.43]I will take off quietly
[01:19.21]Like a bird that flees the cold
[01:48.02]My God (x7)
