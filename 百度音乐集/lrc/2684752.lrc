[00:19.84]I wish you bluebirds in the spring
[00:24.34]To give your heart a song to sing
[00:29.48]And then a kiss
[00:31.82]But more than this
[00:34.55]I wish you love
[00:39.55]And in July a lemonade
[00:44.07]To cool you in some leafy glade
[00:48.78]I wish you health
[00:51.28]And more than wealth
[00:53.77]I wish you love
[00:56.43]
[00:58.08]My breaking heart and I agree
[01:08.04]So with my best, my very best
[01:12.54]I set you free
[01:17.09]I wish you shelter from the storm
[01:22.59]A cozy fire to keep you warm
[01:27.04]But most of all
[01:29.56]When snowflakes fall
[01:32.16]I wish you love
[01:35.83]
[02:15.16]My breaking heart and I agree
[02:24.88]So with my best, my very best
[02:29.30]I set you free
[02:34.34]I wish you shelter from the storm
[02:39.40]A cozy fire to keep you warm
[02:43.84]But most of all
[02:46.06]When snowflakes fall
[02:48.38]I wish you love
[02:55.49]When snowflakes fall
[02:58.29]I wish you love
[03:05.44]When snowflakes fall
[03:07.65]I wish you love
[03:15.07]When snowflakes fall
[03:17.26]I wish you love
