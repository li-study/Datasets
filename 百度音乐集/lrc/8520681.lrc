[00:29.40]He deals the cards as a meditation
[00:34.51]And those he plays never suspect
[00:39.89]He doesn't play for the money he wins
[00:45.15]He doesn't play for respect
[00:51.50]He deals the cards to find the answer
[00:56.85]The sacred geometery of chance
[01:02.07]The hidden law of a probable outcome
[01:08.07]The numbers lead a dance
[01:13.17]I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
[01:18.66]I know that the clubs are weapons of war
[01:24.05]I know that diamonds mean money for this art
[01:28.92]that's not the shape of my heart
[01:34.51]that's not the shape of my heart
[01:40.01]that's not the shape of my heart
