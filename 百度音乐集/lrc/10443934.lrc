[00:00.79]Matt Nathanson - Kept
[00:03.26]
[00:12.40]I watched the flames slow and strange
[00:18.92]Let the walls fill my eyes
[00:24.73]I heard your voice through the noise
[00:31.17]I was cold and it was warm inside
[00:36.67]
[00:37.61]And I should have kept my hands
[00:42.30]I should have kept my arms inside
[00:47.12]I believe you now
[00:51.72]I should have kept my head
[00:54.81]I should have kept my heart, my heart
[01:04.30]
[01:14.37]Shooting stars, falling leaves
[01:21.10]The more things change, the more I sleep
[01:26.63]I took her heart and I licked her wounds
[01:33.50]And morning came and it felt like truth
[01:39.17]
[01:39.87]But I should have kept my hands
[01:44.70]I should have kept my arms inside
[01:49.42]Yeah I believe you now
[01:54.04]I should have kept my head
[01:57.02]I should have kept my heart, my heart
[02:09.18]
[02:33.99]I'm on my knees
[02:36.34]And I should have kept my hands
[02:40.68]I should have kept my arms inside
[02:45.47]Yeah I believe you now
[02:50.24]I should have kept my head
[02:53.44]I should have kept my heart, my heart
[03:04.72]
