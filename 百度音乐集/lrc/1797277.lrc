[00:01.59]<Romeo And Juliet>
[00:03.83]
[00:23.44]A lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade
[00:28.83]Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
[00:34.43]Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
[00:39.08]Says something like, "You and me, babe, how about it?"
[00:44.26]
[00:45.83]Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
[00:51.19]He's underneath the window, she's singing
[00:54.24]"Hey, la, my boyfriend's back
[00:58.70]You shouldn't come around here, singing up people like that
[01:03.71]Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"
[01:07.00]
[01:09.03]Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
[01:13.85]And I bet, that you exploded in my heart
[01:19.35]And I forget, I forget.. the movie song
[01:26.39]When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
[01:32.44]
[01:42.98]Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
[01:48.77]Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
[01:54.10]And I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
[01:59.88]How can you look at me, as if I was just another one of your deals?
[02:04.34]
[02:05.20]Well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
[02:11.20]You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
[02:17.11]You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
[02:22.82]Now you just say, "Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know
[02:25.24]I used to have a scene with him"
[02:26.97]
[02:27.46]Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
[02:32.69]I said, "I love you like the stars above, I love you 'till I die"
[02:38.16]And there's a place for us, you know the movie song
[02:44.35]When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
[02:51.82]
[03:01.72]I can't do the talk, like the talk on the TV
[03:07.23]And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
[03:12.92]I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
[03:18.50]I can't do anything except be in love with you
[03:23.11]
[03:24.61]And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
[03:30.14]All I do is keep the beat, and the bad company
[03:35.89]And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
[03:41.79]Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time
[03:45.50]
[03:46.69]Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
[03:51.80]I said, "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'till I die"
[03:57.38]There's a place for us, you know the movie song
[04:03.07]When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
[04:09.70]
[04:32.26]A lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets of serenade
[04:37.90]Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
[04:43.70]Find a convenient streetlight, and steps out of the shade
[04:48.60]He says something like, "You and me, babe -how about it?"
