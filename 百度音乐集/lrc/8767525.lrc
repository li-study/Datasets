[00:03.18]
[00:13.93]Rains of sand slip through your hands
[00:17.50]Never ceasing time
[00:20.97]Fold your hands in silent prayer
[00:24.45]Eternal peace you`ll find
[00:27.98]Like two rivers flow
[00:31.76]to the open sea
[00:35.41]Someday we`ll reunite
[00:38.16]for all eternity
[00:41.96]Let the rain falling on your face
[00:45.53]Run in to your eyes
[00:49.04]Can you see the rainbow now
[00:52.52]Through the stormy skies
[00:55.94]Like two rivers flow
[00:59.76]to the open sea
[01:03.38]Someday we`ll reunite
[01:06.19]for all eternity

[01:34.41]for all eternity
[01:38.12]Standing in the rising tide
[01:41.45]Heaven`s light shines on you
[01:47.30]On you, on you
[01:54.08]Test the sea rising at your feet
[01:57.42]How far can you go
[02:00.80]Til you need God`s helping hand
[02:04.03]To ride the under-toe
[02:07.74]Like two rivers flow
[02:11.47]to the open sea
[02:15.13]Someday we`ll reunite
[02:18.01]for all eternity
[02:20.45]Someday we`ll reunite
