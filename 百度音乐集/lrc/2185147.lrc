[00:15.45]Nobody told me that being happy faces
[00:18.00]Just trying to erase the traces
[00:21.55]What came before me
[00:26.40]A girl that I used to see somewhere very deep
[00:31.98]She's falling asleep and I trying to wake her
[00:34.31]Set her free
[00:39.40]Now is a never ending thing
[00:45.46]One more minute turns into another
[00:50.49]Before I've had time to to run from all the other ones
[00:55.70]And its so hard to live a dream
[01:04.08]When the everything that they want you to be
[01:13.45]Is anything but me
[01:19.19]So much confusion circling inside my head
[01:22.32]What this one and that one said
[01:25.03]Its all an illusion
[01:29.53]Cuz I'm still the same person no matter how fast I run
[01:37.02]I'm trying to hold on to where it is I come from
[01:44.69]Now is a never ending thing
[01:48.75]One more minute turns into another
[01:52.60]Before I've had time to to run from all the other ones
[01:58.44]And its so hard to live a dream
[02:06.27]When the everything that they want you to be
[02:15.89]Is anything but me
[02:24.11]Anything but me
[02:31.91]I'm trying to hold on to where it is I come from
[02:38.10]Now is a never ending thing
[02:42.89]One more minute turns into another
[02:47.67]Before I've had time to to run from all the other ones
[02:52.44]And its so hard to live a dream
[03:01.20]When the everything that they want you to be
[03:05.76]Is anything but me
