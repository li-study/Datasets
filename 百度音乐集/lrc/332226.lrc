[00:-3.00]Owl City - If My Heart Was A House
[00:-2.00]

[00:01.00]
[00:02.26]You're the sky that I fell through
[00:07.67]And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
[00:14.78]The sun hung from a string
[00:19.21]Looking down on the world as it warmed over everything
[00:26.25]
[00:26.73]Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
[00:33.77]And your sighs harmonize with mine
[00:37.92]Unmistakeably, I can still feel your heart
[00:45.18]Beat fast when you dance with me
[00:49.51]
[00:49.85]We got older and I should've known
[00:54.17](Do you feel alive?)
[00:55.22]That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
[00:59.48](Oh, but you'll survive)
[01:00.87]So I may as well ditch my dismay
[01:05.41](Bombs away, bombs away)
[01:16.63]
[01:18.37]Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
[01:24.11]Back and forth
[01:25.68]If my heart was a compass you'd be north
[01:29.82]Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall
[01:34.77]Wherever you go
[01:37.32]If my heart was a house you'd be home
[01:41.74]
[01:51.69]It makes me smile because you said it best
[01:57.05]I would clearly feel blessed
[02:00.12]If the sun rose up from the west
[02:04.20]Flower balm perfume
[02:08.63]All my clothes smell like you
[02:11.88]'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue
[02:15.92]
[02:16.25]I walk slowly when I'm on my own
[02:20.34](Do you feel alive?)
[02:21.59]Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone
[02:26.06](Oh, but you'll survive)
[02:27.49]So I may as well ditch my dismay
[02:32.05](Bombs away, bombs away)
[02:42.90]
[02:44.83]Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
[02:50.33]Back and forth
[02:52.03]If my heart was a compass you'd be north
[02:56.29]Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall
[03:01.16]Wherever you go
[03:03.84]If my heart was a house you'd be home
[03:08.60]
[03:15.62]If my heart was a house you'd be home
[03:20.68]
