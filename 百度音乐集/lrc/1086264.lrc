[00:02.88]You're gonna hate me when I tell you everything
[00:11.94]You're gonna question whether you really know me at all
[00:21.54]You will revisit every smile, and where it fit into the day
[00:30.36]I know this is how it will play
[00:36.39]And I try, oh I try to think of all the things
[00:44.48]That I could do to let you know that I love U

[02:48.27]And I cry, I cry so very much
[02:57.21]For I love you like you'll never let yourself feel again
[03:05.15]I love you like a brother and a friend
[03:13.58]I love you with my whole heart until it bends
[03:22.04]I love you like a lover until the very end
[03:31.41]But I'll always think of all the things you did
[03:36.68]To let me know that you love me
