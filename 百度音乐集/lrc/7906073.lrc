[00:01.34]Someday We'll Know
[00:02.86]
[00:04.74]By: Claire Tong
[00:05.98]For Jack Chan
[00:07.14]
[00:09.85]90 Miles outside Chicago
[00:14.28]Can't stop driving
[00:16.01]I don't know why
[00:18.60]So many questions
[00:21.26]I Need an answer
[00:23.22]2 years later
[00:25.36]You're still on my mind
[00:26.43]
[00:27.76]Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart
[00:32.05]Who holds the stars up in the sky
[00:36.43]Is true love just once in a lifetime
[00:42.51]Did the captain of the Titanic cry
[00:43.87]
[00:45.08](Chorus)
[00:49.44]Someday we'll know
[00:51.46]If love can move a mountain
[00:53.88]Someday we'll know
[00:55.94]Why the sky is blue
[00:58.30]Someday we'll know
[01:00.44]Why I was meant for you
[01:05.69]
[01:07.74]Does anybody know the way to Atlantis
[01:12.06]Or what the wind says when she cries
[01:16.56]I'm speeding by the place that I met you
[01:22.65]for the 97th time.... tonight
[01:27.68]
[01:28.76](Chorus)
[01:29.44]Someday we'll know
[01:31.48]If love can move a mountain
[01:33.86]Someday we'll know
[01:36.21]Why the sky is blue
[01:38.35]Someday we'll know
[01:40.51]Why I was meant for you
[01:45.43](yah yah yah yahhhhhh)
[01:47.08]
[01:47.50]Someday we'll know
[01:49.27]Why Sampson loved Delilah
[01:51.79]One day I'll go
[01:53.76]Dancing on the moon
[01:56.18]Someday you'll know
[01:58.50]That I was the one for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[02:04.48]
[02:27.99]I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
[02:32.37]I watched the stars crash in the sea
[02:36.78]If I could ask God just one question
[02:45.36]Why aren't you here with me.......tonight
[02:48.94]
[02:49.49](Chorus)
[02:52.55]Someday we'll know
[02:55.16]If love can move a mountain
[02:56.25]Someday we'll know
[02:58.22]Why the sky is blue
[03:00.63]Someday we'll know
[03:02.68]Why I was meant for you
[03:07.53](yah yah yah yahhhhh)
[03:08.70]
[03:09.69]Someday we'll know
[03:11.52]Why Sampson loved Delilah
[03:14.06]One day I'll go
[03:16.14]Dancing on the moon
[03:18.43]Someday you'll know
[03:20.57]That I was the one for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
