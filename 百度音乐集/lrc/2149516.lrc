[00:00.00]Everytime
[00:05.50]Britney
[00:10.14]notice me
[00:14.48]take my hand
[00:18.86]why are we
[00:23.22]Strangers when
[00:27.04]Our love is strong
[00:31.59]Why carry on without me?
[00:36.17]And everytime I try to fly
[00:39.57]I fall without my wings
[00:42.84]I feel so small
[00:45.22]I guess I need you baby
[00:49.11]And everytime I see you in my dreams
[00:53.61]I see your face, it's haunting me
[00:58.32]I guess I need you baby
[01:03.00]
[01:11.72]I make believe
[01:15.90]That you are here
[01:20.21]It's the only way
[01:24.75]I see clear
[01:28.67]What have I done
[01:33.08]You seem to move on easy
[01:37.61]And everytime I try to fly
[01:41.18]I fall without my wings
[01:44.41]I feel so small
[01:46.89]I guess I need you baby
[01:50.68]And everytime I see you in my dreams
[01:55.16]I see your face, you haunting me
[01:59.87]I guess I need you baby
[02:03.43]
[02:05.21]I may have made it rain
[02:10.39]Please forgive me
[02:13.66]My weakness caused you pain
[02:18.23]And this song is my sorry
[02:26.09]
[02:43.71]At night I pray
[02:48.14]That soon your face
[02:50.51]Will fade away
[02:52.74]And everytime I try to fly
[02:55.60]I fall without my wings
[02:59.30]I feel so small
[03:01.75]I guess I need you baby
[03:05.72]And everytime I see you in my dreams
[03:10.26]I see your face, you haunting me
[03:15.05]I guess I need you baby
