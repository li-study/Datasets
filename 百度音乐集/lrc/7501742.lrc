[00:03.15]Artist: Groove Armada Lyrics
[00:25.77]Song: Hands Of Time
[00:52.02]Keep looking through the window pane
[00:54.44]Just trying to see through the pouring rain
[00:57.56]It's hearing your name, hearing your name
[01:02.38]I never really felt quite the same,
[01:04.96]Since I've lost what I had to gain
[01:07.96]No one to blame, no one to blame
[01:12.85]Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
[01:23.00]Oh it seems to me, can't back the hands of time
[02:05.79]Keep looking through the window pane
[02:08.08]Just trying to see through the pouring rain
[02:11.20]It's hearing your name, hearing your name
[02:15.95]I never really felt quite the same,
[02:18.55]Since I've lost what I had to gain
[02:21.50]No one to blame, no one to blame
[02:26.74]Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
[02:36.67]Oh it seems to me, can't back the hands of time
[02:47.67]Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
[02:48.14]Oh it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
[02:58.09]Seems to me, history was left behind
