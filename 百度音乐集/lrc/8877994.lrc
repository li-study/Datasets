[02:18.92][00:00.00]Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[02:31.02][00:11.67]That saved a boy like me.
[02:41.97][00:22.30]I once was lost, but now I'm found
[02:53.97][00:34.83]Was blind, but now I see.
[00:45.41]'Twas grace that taught my heart to see
[00:57.66]And grace my soul relieved.
[01:09.57]How precious did that grace appear
[01:21.34]The hour I first believed.
[01:32.52]If I should leave ten thousand years
[01:44.33]Bright shining as the sun,
[01:55.65]I would need more days to sing God's praise
[02:07.58]Then when I first begun.
