[00:07.36]We went for a ride
[00:12.14]We went for a ride
[00:16.44]We went for a ride
[00:20.68]We went for a ride
[00:25.11]We went for a ride
[00:27.12]Undercover of the twilight
[00:29.08]And the traffic on the road
[00:31.46]And there's only you and I
[00:33.26]I hope we never get back home
[00:35.76]'Cause I'm feeling serenaded
[00:37.69]By the coming of the night
[00:40.01]And I wish we'd go forever
[00:42.13]And I wish we could just
[00:43.78]Drive away
[00:46.63]We could drive away
[00:51.05]We could drive away
[00:55.40]Into the night
[00:58.64]We went for a ride
[01:01.84]With your words of consolation
[01:03.61]And the trees of crystal white
[01:05.99]I'll be praying for a red light
[01:08.09]To extend this precious night
[01:10.28]Cause we both know where I'm going
[01:12.30]And we know it just ain't right
[01:14.65]And there's nothing we can do
[01:16.41]Except to keep on moving
[01:18.21]Drive away
[01:21.45]We could drive away
[01:25.68]We could drive away
[01:30.07]Into the night
[01:31.86]
[01:34.24]We went for a ride
[01:38.50]We went for a ride
[01:42.78]We went for a ride
[01:47.42]We went for a ride
[01:51.47]
[02:09.06]Here we are We are alone together
[02:15.56]
[02:17.08]We went for a ride Here we are alone together
[02:24.44]
[02:44.09]Here we are
[02:45.99]We are alone together
[02:49.99]We went for a ride
[02:53.38]Here we are
[02:54.77]We are alone together
[02:58.96]Here we are
[03:02.12]Here we are
[03:03.27]We are alone together
[03:07.20]Drive away
[03:08.10]Drive away
[03:09.13]To any place faraway
[03:11.41]Here we are alone together
[03:16.19]
[03:19.02]Here we are
[03:20.73]We are alone together
