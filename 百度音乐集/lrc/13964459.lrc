
[00:01.00]A long long time ago
[00:03.00]I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
[00:12.00]And I knew if I had my chance
[00:15.00]That I could make those people dance
[00:19.00]And maybe they'd be happy for a while.
[00:25.00]But February made me shiver
[00:29.00]With every paper I'd deliver
[00:33.00]Bad news on the doorstep
[00:36.00]I couldn't take one more step
[00:40.00]I can't remember if I cried
[00:43.00]When I read about his widowed bride
[00:48.00]But something touched me deep inside
[00:53.00]The day the music died
[01:03.00]So Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[01:07.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[01:09.00]But the levee was dry
[01:12.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[01:17.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[01:23.00]This'll be the day that I die
[01:29.00]Did you write the Book of Love
[01:31.00]And do you have faith in God above
[01:35.00]If the Bible tells you so
[01:40.00]Do you believe in rock 'n roll
[01:43.00]Can music save your mortal soul
[01:47.00]And can you teach me how to dance real slow
[01:53.00]Well, I know that you're in love with him
[01:57.00]'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
[02:01.00]You both kicked off your shoes
[02:03.00]Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
[02:08.00]I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
[02:11.00]With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
[02:14.00]But I knew I was out of luck
[02:17.00]The day the music died
[02:24.00]I started singin'
[02:25.00]Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[02:28.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[02:30.00]But the levee was dry
[02:32.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[02:35.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[02:39.00]This'll be the day that I die
[02:43.00]Now for ten years we've been on our own
[02:47.00]And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
[02:51.00]But that's not how it used to be
[02:56.00]When the jester sang for the King and Queen
[02:59.00]In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
[03:03.00]And a voice that came from you and me
[03:10.00]Oh, and while the King was looking down
[03:14.00]The jester stole his thorny crown
[03:17.00]The courtroom was adjourned
[03:20.00]No verdict was returned
[03:24.00]And while Lennon read a book of Marx
[03:28.00]The quartet practiced in the park
[03:31.00]And we sang dirges in the dark
[03:34.00]The day the music died
[03:40.00]We were singing
[03:41.00]Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[03:44.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[03:47.00]But the levee was dry
[03:49.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[03:52.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[03:56.00]This'll be the day that I die
[04:01.00]Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
[04:04.00]The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
[04:09.00]Eight miles high and falling fast
[04:14.00]It landed foul out on the grass
[04:17.00]The players tried for a forward pass
[04:20.00]With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
[04:26.00]Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
[04:30.00]While the Sergeants played a marching tune
[04:34.00]We all got up to dance
[04:37.00]Oh, but we never got the chance
[04:40.00]'Cause the players tried to take the field
[04:44.00]The marching band refused to yield
[04:48.00]Do you recall what was revealed
[04:51.00]The day the music died
[04:57.00]We started singing
[04:58.00]Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[05:01.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[05:03.00]But the levee was dry
[05:05.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[05:08.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[05:13.00]This'll be the day that I die
[05:17.00]Oh, and there we were all in one place
[05:21.00]A generation Lost in Space
[05:24.00]With no time left to start again
[05:29.00]So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
[05:34.00]Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
[05:36.00]'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
[05:43.00]Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
[05:47.00]My hands were clenched in fists of rage
[05:51.00]No angel born in hell
[05:54.00]Could break that Satan's spell
[05:56.00]And as the flames climbed high into the night
[06:02.00]To light the sacrifical rite
[06:05.00]I saw Satan laughing with delight
[06:08.00]The day the music died
[06:15.00]He was singing
[06:16.00]Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[06:19.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[06:21.00]But the levee was dry
[06:23.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[06:26.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[06:30.00]This'll be the day that I die
[06:36.00]I met a girl who sang the blues
[06:40.00]And I asked her for some happy news
[06:44.00]But she just smiled and turned away
[06:49.00]I went down to the sacred store
[06:51.00]Where I'd heard the music years before
[06:55.00]But the man there said the music wouldn't play
[07:03.00]And in the streets the children screamed
[07:07.00]The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
[07:10.00]But not a word was spoken
[07:15.00]The church bells all were broken
[07:19.00]And the three men I admire most
[07:23.00]The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
[07:27.00]They caught the last train for the coast
[07:31.00]The day the music died
[07:39.00]And they were singing
[07:41.00]Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[07:46.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[07:49.00]But the levee was dry
[07:52.00]And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
[07:56.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
[08:03.00]This'll be the day that I die
[08:08.00]They were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
[08:15.00]Drove my chevy to the levee
[08:17.00]But the levee was dry
[08:20.00]Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
[08:24.00]Singin' this'll be the day that I die
