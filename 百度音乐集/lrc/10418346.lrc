[00:17.69]How did I ever let you slip away
[00:25.76]never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
[00:34.80]And now I'm sinking,sinking to rise no more
[00:44.35]Ever since you closed the door
[00:55.51]
[02:07.70][00:55.95]If I could turn,turn back the hands of time
[03:14.60]Whoa if I could turn,turn back the hands of time
[03:27.77][02:20.78][01:06.34]then my darlin' you'd still be mine
[03:35.73][02:30.02][01:14.63]If I could turn,turn back the hands of time
[03:45.94][02:39.07][01:23.90]then my darlin' you,you'd still be mine
[01:31.11]
[01:32.74]Funny,funnyhow time goes by
[01:41.82]And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
[01:49.53]why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
[01:58.98]when everyday I pray please come back to me
[02:06.26]
[02:47.59]And you had enough love for the both of us
[02:57.47]But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
[03:06.83]But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone,
[03:53.42][03:13.64]
[03:54.33]I'd never hurt you(if I could turn back)
[03:58.20]Never do you wrong(if I could turn back)
[04:02.75]And never leave your side(if I could turn back)
[04:07.25]If I could turn back the hands
[04:10.14]
[04:12.25](if I could turn back)
[04:14.59]If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
[04:19.32](if I could turn back)
[04:21.06]Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
[04:34.02]Love you,(if I could turn back)
[04:38.73]love you,(if I could turn back)
[04:43.04]love you,(if I could turn back)
