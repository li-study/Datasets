[00:06.85]
[00:10.13]Motley Crue(Feat. Chester Bennington)
[00:44.52]You know I'm a dreamer
[00:47.50]But my heart's of gold
[00:50.55]I had to run away and hide
[00:54.20]Coz i couldn't go home
[00:57.36]Just when things went right
[01:00.41]Suddenly it all went wrong
[01:04.01]Just take this song and you'll never feel
[01:07.45]Left all alone
[01:10.65]Take me to your heart
[01:13.93]Feel me in your bones
[01:16.80]Just one more night
[01:19.86]And I'm comin' off this
[01:22.28]Long & winding road
[01:27.80]I'm on my way
[01:30.24]I'm on my way
[01:33.45]Home sweet home
[01:38.08]Tonight tonight
[01:40.16]I'm on my way
[01:43.82]I'm on my way
[01:46.83]Home sweet home
[01:53.94]You know that I've seen
[01:56.77]Too many romantic dreams
[02:00.77]Up in lights, fallin' off
[02:04.24]The silver screen
[02:08.43]My heart's like an open book
[02:11.60]For the whole world to read
[02:14.23]Sometimes nothing-keeps me together
[02:18.36]At the seams
[02:21.66]I'm on my way
[02:24.03]Well I'm on my way
[02:26.48]Home sweet home
[02:31.71]Tonight tonight
[02:33.70]I'm on my way
[02:37.46]Just set me free
[02:40.16]Home sweet home
