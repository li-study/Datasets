[00:02.00]Jennifer Lopez - (What Is) LOVE
[00:06.00]
[00:17.60]People told me,
[00:19.37]I should write a love song
[00:21.50]"Girl you sound so angry,
[00:23.75]You could use some variation"
[00:26.51]But I'm lonely
[00:28.11]Negative relations
[00:30.22]I've been hurt so many times
[00:32.30]I don't have the patience
[01:44.88][00:34.98]But I've wished for so long
[01:46.89][00:37.19]For someone to come and show me
[01:50.16][00:40.19]Lead by example
[01:52.13][00:42.45]'Cause I've been waiting
[01:53.74][00:43.93]I've tried every age
[01:55.74][00:45.96]I'm so tired of the game
[01:58.90][00:49.02]I wanna be somebody's girl
[02:02.14][00:52.36]Would you show me the way?
[03:14.16][02:03.90][00:54.29]What if I never find and I'm left behind?
[03:19.69][02:09.95][01:00.05]Should I keep hoping for love?
[03:22.45][02:12.71][01:02.87]What if I'm still the same?
[03:26.86][02:17.06][01:07.12]Status doesn't change?
[03:28.87][02:19.17][01:08.87]Gotta keep hoping for love
[03:38.08][03:33.94][03:29.72][02:28.43][02:24.11][02:19.99][01:18.61][01:14.32][01:10.20]What is love?
[03:42.52][02:32.80][01:22.98]What is love? Please show me.
[01:27.56]I've had blind dates
[01:29.07]Hooked up with some real flakes
[01:31.34]I've gone out with church boys
[01:33.58]Musicians are the worst
[01:36.19]I've tried so hard
[01:37.95]'Cause I'm just so die hard
[01:40.08]Tried my best to play the part
[01:42.23]Wish you could see inside
[02:55.34]I've been alone
[02:56.73]For the past three years
[02:57.75]On Valentine's Day
[02:59.66]Christmas is no exception
[03:01.94]Birthday's with naughty presents
[03:04.34]Been back and forth, same action
[03:06.55]I just need this to happen
[03:09.43]I'll be singing love's praises
[03:12.18]If you would show me
