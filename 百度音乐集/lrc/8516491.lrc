[00:32.81]Please don't go crazy, if I tell you the truth
[00:37.19]No you don't know what happened
[00:40.51]And you never will if
[00:42.16]You don't listen to me while I talk to the wall
[00:47.51]This blanket is freezing, it's been out in the hall
[00:52.57]Where you've had me for hours
[00:55.73]Till I'm sure what I want
[00:58.08]But darling I want the same thing that I wanted before
[01:03.09]So sweetheart tell me what's up I won't stop no way
[01:14.60]Please keep your hands down
[01:16.96]And stop raising your voice
[01:19.24]It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
[01:24.14]It's a simple suggestion can you give me sometime
[01:29.41]So just say yes or no
[01:32.38]Why can't you shoulder the blame
[01:34.93]Coz both my shoulders are heavy
[01:37.78]From the weight of us both
[01:40.19]You're a big boy now so let's not talk about growth
[01:45.38]You've not heard a single word I have said...
[01:50.69]Oh, my God
[02:39.28]Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
[02:43.19]I haven't made half the mistakes
[02:46.31]That you've listed so far
[02:48.58]Oh baby let me explain something
[02:51.83]It's all down to drugs
[02:54.13]At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
[02:59.19]It seems I've stepped over lines
[03:02.14]You've drawn again and again
[03:04.45]But if the ecstacy's in the wit is definitely out
[03:07.00]Dr. Jekyll is wrestling Hyde for my pride
