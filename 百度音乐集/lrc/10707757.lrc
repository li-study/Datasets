[00:17.39]
[00:19.39]I had to escape
[00:21.24]The city was sticky and cruel
[00:25.58]Maybe I should have called you first
[00:28.66]But I was dying to get to you
[00:32.36]I was dreaming while I drove
[00:34.23]The long straight road ahead, uh, huh
[00:39.68]Could taste your sweet kisses
[00:41.33]Your arms open wide
[00:43.13]This fever for you is just burning me up inside

[01:38.01]The beating of our one heart
[01:41.68]I think about you
[01:43.09]When the night is cold and dark, uh, huh
[01:49.05]No one can move me
[01:50.29]The way that you do
[01:52.26]Nothing erases the feeling between me and you
[02:01.55]
