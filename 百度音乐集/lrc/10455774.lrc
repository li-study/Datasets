[00:22.96]So you speak to me in sadness of the coming of the winter,
[00:30.09]fear that is within' you now that seems to never end,
[00:36.11]and the dreams that have escaped you and the hope that you've forgotten
[00:42.41]and you tell me that you need me now and you want to be my friend
[00:48.65]and you wonder where we're going, where's the rhyme and where's the reason
[00:55.35]and it's you cannot accept it is here we must begin
[01:01.48]to seek the wisdom of the children
[01:07.81]and the graceful way of flowers in the wind.
[01:14.45]For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
[01:21.46]their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.
[01:28.00]Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
[01:34.53]they're a promise of the future and the blessing for today.
[01:43.46]
[01:49.23]Though the city starts to crumble and the towers fall around us
[01:56.02]the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
[02:02.25]it is written: From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us
[02:08.76]by the hand and by the heart and they will comfort you and me.
[02:15.16]In their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free.
[02:23.02]For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
[02:30.42]their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.
[02:36.66]And the song that I am singing is a prayer for nonbelievers
[02:43.42]come and stand beside us we can find a better way.
