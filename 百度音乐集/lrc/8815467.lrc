[02:36.64][00:33.11]You see me, the real me
[00:37.22]No in bewteens, I had nowhere to hide
[00:44.29]You took away the walls around me
[00:49.59]Made me feel safe to share my truth
[02:46.23][02:03.49][00:57.02]I see the heavens open,
[02:48.62][02:06.32][00:59.64]a heart that once was broken
[02:51.23][02:09.21][01:02.02]Is holding nothing back

[03:01.69][02:19.50][01:13.08]A lifetime just ain't
[03:03.69][02:21.45][01:16.28]enough to love you true
[01:30.25]I do believe we're meant to be

[01:41.33]We'll see some tears
[01:43.87]We'll conquer fears
[01:46.63]And together we will grow
