[00:00.00]Blueberry Hill
[00:01.29]
[00:04.00]I found my thrill on blueberry hill
[00:14.84]On blueberry hill where i found you
[00:27.80]The moon stood still on blueberry hill
[00:40.01]And lingered till my dreams came true
[00:52.48]
[00:54.00]The wind in the willow played
[01:00.10]Love's sweet melody
[01:04.72]But all of those vows we made
[01:12.21]Were never to be
[01:18.31]
[01:19.13]Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
[01:29.98]For you were my thrill on blueberry hill
[01:42.54]The wind in the willow played
[01:50.06]Love's sweet melody
[01:54.70]
[01:57.13]But all of those vows we made
[02:02.79]Were never to be
[02:08.34]Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
[02:22.39]For you were my thrill on blueberry hill
