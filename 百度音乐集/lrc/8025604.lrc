[00:01.12]Pink - Crystal Ball
[00:08.10]
[00:16.10]Drinking wine and thinking bliss, is on the other side of this
[00:20.04]I just need a compass and a willing accomplice
[00:23.84]All my doubts that fill my head are skidding up and down again
[00:27.82]Up and down and round again, down and up and round again.
[00:31.42]
[00:31.62]Oh, I've had my chances and I've taken them all.
[00:39.45]Just to end up right back here on the floor.
[00:43.19]To end up right back here in on the floor.
[00:47.32]Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
[00:52.85]Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.
[00:58.72]But I'm not scared at all...hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
[01:06.48]The cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.
[01:12.74]
[01:18.14]Sometimes you think everything is wrapped inside a diamond ring
[01:22.04]Love just needs a witness and a little forgivness
[01:25.62]And a halo of patience and a less sporadic pace and
[01:29.57]I'm learning to be brave in my beautiful mistakes.
[01:33.52]Oh I've felt that fire and I've been burned
[01:41.11]But I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned
[01:45.12]I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned.
[01:49.28]Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
[01:54.68]Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.
[02:00.66]But I'm not scared at all...hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
[02:08.12]Of the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.
[02:15.85]
[02:20.14]Irony, irony, this hate and love, hate and love
[02:27.42]What it does to me, what it's done to me.
[02:31.45]What is done...done
[02:40.18]
[02:41.63]Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
[02:48.15]Broken mirrors and a black cats cold stare,
[02:51.71]Walk under ladders on my way to hell, I'll meet you there.
[02:57.17]But I'm not scared at all, hmm...I'm not scared at all.
[03:08.51]Bout the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.
