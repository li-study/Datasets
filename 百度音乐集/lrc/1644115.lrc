[00:35.28]Windflowers,
[00:40.30]my father told me not to go near them
[00:43.52]He said he feared them always
[00:46.48]And he told me
[00:50.61]that they carried him away
[00:56.06]Windflowers, Beautiful Windflowers
[01:03.00]I couldn't wait to touch them
[01:06.58]To smell them I held them closely
[01:11.47]And now I cannot break away
[01:20.33]Their sweet bouquet disappears
[01:26.35]Like the vapor in the desert
[01:31.69]So, take a warming ,son
[01:39.46]Windflowers , ancient windflowers
[01:45.93]Their beauty captures every young dreamer
[01:49.22]who lingers near them
[01:52.96]But ancient windflowers, I love you
