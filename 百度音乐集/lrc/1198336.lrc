[00:00.00]Norah Jones - Cold Cold Heart
[00:11.13]
[00:13.13]I tried so hard my dear to show
[00:16.98]That you're my every dream
[00:23.10]Yet you're afraid
[00:25.61]Each thing I do is just some evil scheme
[00:32.45]A memory from your lonesome past
[00:36.55]Keeps us so far apart
[00:40.00]Why can't I free your doubtful mind
[00:44.60]And melt your cold cold heart
[00:48.33]
[00:55.12]Another love before my time
[00:59.27]Made your heart sad and blue
[01:05.78]And so my heart is paying now
[01:10.44]For things I didn't do
[01:14.16]In anger unkind words are said
[01:18.86]That make the teardrops start
[01:22.25]Why can't I free your doubtful mind
[01:26.87]And melt your cold cold heart
[01:31.45]
[02:20.27]There was a time when I believed
[02:23.36]That you belonged to me
[02:29.47]But now I know
[02:31.66]Your heart is shackled to a memory
[02:38.60]The more I learn to care for you
[02:42.28]The more we drift apart
[02:46.22]Why can't I free your doubtful mind
[02:51.30]And melt your cold cold heart
[02:56.01]
