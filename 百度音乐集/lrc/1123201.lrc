[00:16.35]Don't you have a word to show what may be done
[00:23.87]Have you never heard a way to find the sun
[02:40.74][01:13.05][00:31.13]Tell me all that you may know
[02:47.87][01:20.56][00:38.02]Show me what you have to show
[02:55.90][00:45.58]Won't you come and say
[02:59.64][01:32.50][00:49.63]If you know the way to blue?
[00:57.45]Have you seen the land living by the breeze
[01:04.74]Can you understand a light among the trees
[01:28.43]Tell us all today
[01:40.96]Look through time and find your rhyme
[01:44.35]Tell us what you find
[01:48.70]We will wait at your gate
[01:51.91]Hoping like the blind.
[02:24.87]Can you now recall all that you have known?
[02:32.10]Will you never fall
[02:36.15]When the light has flown?
