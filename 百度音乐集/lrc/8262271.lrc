[00:09.55]I'll Still Love You More
[00:11.77]
[00:13.45]Ask me how much you mean to me
[00:19.00]And I wouldn't even know where to start
[00:26.36]Ask if this love runs deep in me
[00:31.98]And you won't find a deeper love in any heart
[00:38.67]
[00:39.48]You could say you couldn't live one day without me
[00:46.01]You could say all of your thoughts are about me
[00:52.64]You could think no other love could be as strong
[00:58.50]But you'd be wrong
[01:01.91]You'd be wrong
[01:04.28]
[01:04.46]If you say that you love me
[01:08.04]More than anybody
[01:11.29]Than anyone's ever been loved before
[01:17.67]As much as you love me
[01:20.91]Baby, I'll still love you
[01:23.90]Baby, I'll still love you more
[01:31.18]I'll still love you more
[01:43.56]
[01:45.52]Ask me just what I'd do for you
[01:51.38]And I'll tell you I would do anything
[01:58.29]Ask if this heart beats true for you
[02:04.11]And I'll show you a truer heart could never be
[02:11.38]
[02:12.24]You could say there's not a star that you won't bring me
[02:18.24]You could say there'll be no day that you won't need me
[02:25.32]You could think no other love could last as long
[02:30.89]But you'd be wrong
[02:34.62]You'd be wrong
[02:35.74]
[02:37.09]If you say that you love me
[02:40.50]More than anybody
[02:43.81]Than anyone's ever been loved before
[02:50.25]As much as you love me
[02:53.53]Baby, I'll still love you
[02:56.64]Baby, I'll still love you more
[03:02.94]And for every kiss
[03:04.74]I'll kiss you back a hundred times
[03:09.25]And for everything you do
[03:12.53]I'll just do more
[03:15.56]And for all the love you give
[03:18.82]I'll give you so much back you'll see
[03:22.65]Got so much love for you inside
[03:28.74]If you say that you love me
[03:32.47]More than anybody
[03:35.50]Than anyone's ever been loved before
[03:41.94]No matter as you love me
[03:45.34]Baby, I'll still love you
[03:48.76]Baby, I'll still love you more
[03:55.42]I'll still love you more
