[00:19.73]I don't know where I crossed the line
[00:24.02]Was it something that I said
[00:27.25]Or didn't say this time
[00:31.32]And I don't know if it's me or you
[00:35.70]But I can see the skies are changing
[00:39.34]In all the shades of blue
[00:42.98]And I don't know which way it's gonna go
[00:48.01]
[00:48.84]If it's gonna be a rainy day
[00:51.89]There's nothing we can do to make it change
[00:54.99]We can pray for sunny weather
[00:58.63]But that won't stop the rain
[01:01.04]Feeling like you got no place to run
[01:04.25]I can be your shelter 'til it's done
[01:07.03]We can make this last forever
[01:10.70]So please don't stop the rain
[01:13.21]
[01:13.60](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[01:17.02]Please don't stop the rain
[01:18.45](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[01:22.92]Please don't stop the rain
[01:25.17]
[01:25.55]I thought that time was on our side
[01:29.48]I've put in far too many years
[01:33.16]To let this pass us by
[01:37.36]You see live is a crazy thing
[01:41.58]There'll be good time and there'll be bad times
[01:45.17]And everything in between
[01:49.06]And I don't know which way it's gonna go
[01:54.77]
[01:55.25]If it's gonna be a rainy day
[01:57.93]There's nothing we can do to make it change
[02:00.92]We can pray for sunny weather
[02:04.68]But that won't stop the rain
[02:07.13]Feeling like you got no place to run
[02:09.93]I can be your shelter 'til it's done
[02:13.04]We can make this last forever
[02:16.65]So please don't stop the rain
[02:19.17]
[02:19.68](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[02:22.98]Please don't stop the rain
[02:24.79](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[02:28.77]Please don't stop the rain
[02:31.26]
[02:31.74]Oh where it close now
[02:36.03]And finally what life's it's all about
[02:41.36]Yeah I know you just can't stand it
[02:45.21]When leaves don't grow your way (?)
[02:48.61]But we've got no control over what happens anyway
[02:53.71]
[02:55.14]If it's gonna be a rainy day
[02:57.93]There's nothing we can do to make it change
[03:00.95]We can pray for sunny weather
[03:04.73]But that won't stop the rain
[03:07.25]Feeling like you got no place to run
[03:10.04]I can be your shelter 'til it's done
[03:13.26]We can make this last forever
[03:16.66]So please don't stop the rain
[03:19.63]
[03:20.10](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[03:22.78]Please don't stop the rain
[03:24.68](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[03:28.96]Please don't stop the rain
[03:30.90]
[03:31.42](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[03:33.67]Can't stop it, can't stop it, just can't stop the rain
[03:36.87](Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
[03:39.35]Let it fall, please don't stop the rain
[03:43.35]
