[00:13.50]
[00:28.02]I watch how the
[00:28.55]Moon sits in the sky in the dark night
[00:30.58]Shining with the light from the sun
[00:31.97]The sun doesn't give life to the moon to assuming
[00:34.07]The moon's going to owe it one
[00:35.53]It makes me think of how you act to me you do
[00:37.24]Favors and then rapidly you just
[00:39.42]Turn around and start asking me about
[00:41.10]Things that you want back from me
[00:42.57]I'm sick of the tension sick of the hunger
[00:44.59]Sick of you acting like I owe you this
[00:46.35]Find another place to feed your greed
[00:48.03]While I find a place to rest
[02:16.82][01:33.24][00:50.08]I wanna be in another place
[02:18.74][01:35.69][00:52.62]I hate when you say you don't understand
[02:22.43][01:39.54][00:56.36](You'll see it's not meant to be)
[02:23.55][01:40.57][00:57.60]I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
[02:27.61][01:44.69][01:01.53]A place for my head
[01:04.46]Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
[01:06.05]Step on people like you do and run
[01:08.29]Away the people I thought I knew
[01:09.74]I remember back then who you were
[01:11.52]You used to be calm used to be strong
[01:12.98]Used to be generous but you should've known that you'd
[01:15.01]Wear out your welcome now you see
[01:16.64]How quiet it is all alone I'm so
[01:18.69]Sick of the tension sick of the hunger
[01:20.40]Sick of you acting like I owe you this
[01:22.13]Find another place to feed your greed
[01:23.87]While I find a place to rest I'm so
[01:25.84]Sick of the tension sick of the hunger
[01:27.53]Sick of you acting like I owe you this
[01:29.26]Find another place to feed your greed
[01:31.12]While I find a place to rest
[02:12.45][02:08.90][02:05.56][02:02.07][01:58.43][01:54.85][01:51.35][01:47.69]You try to take the best of me
[02:15.18][02:11.56][02:08.00][02:04.57][02:00.80][01:57.16][01:53.72][01:50.14]Go away
[02:31.43]
[02:34.32]Shut up
[02:39.36]
[02:51.69][02:44.54]I am so sick of the tension sick of the hunger
[02:53.84][02:46.23]Sick of you acting like I owe you this
[02:55.55][02:48.37]Find another place to feed your greed
[02:57.23][02:49.98]While I find a place to rest
[03:00.18]
