[00:00.10]John Mayer - Neon
[00:08.54]
[00:10.54]When sky blue gets dark enough
[00:14.94]To see the colors of the city lights
[00:20.07]A trail of ruby red and diamond white
[00:24.14]Hits her like a sunrise
[00:26.95]
[00:28.18]She comes and goes and comes and goes
[00:32.68]Like no one can
[00:35.64]
[00:47.41]Tonight she's out to lose herself
[00:52.05]And find a high on Peachtree Street
[00:56.98]From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
[01:01.45]Heavy into everything
[01:04.60]
[01:05.60]She comes and goes and comes and goes
[01:10.10]Like no one can
[01:14.95]She comes and goes and no one knows
[01:19.26]She's slipping through my hands
[01:25.28]She's always buzzing just like
[01:27.85]Neon, neon
[01:32.44]Neon, neon
[01:37.15]Who knows how long, how long, how long
[01:43.26]She can go before she burns away
[01:46.19]
[01:55.48]I can't be her angel now
[01:59.71]You know it's not my place to hold her down
[02:04.47]And it's hard for me to take a stand
[02:08.72]When I would take her anyway I can
[02:12.11]
[02:13.53]She comes and she goes
[02:18.03]Like no one can
[02:22.88]She comes and she goes
[02:27.28]She's slipping through my hands
[02:31.04]She's always buzzing just like
[02:33.45]Neon, neon
[02:38.07]Neon, neon
[02:42.67]Who knows how long, how long, how long
[02:48.82]She can go before she burns away
[02:55.69]
[03:14.48]She comes and she goes
[03:18.97]Like no one can
[03:23.73]She comes and she goes
[03:28.34]She's slipping through my hands
[03:31.79]She's always buzzing just like
[03:34.28]Neon, neon
[03:38.97]Neon, neon
[03:43.61]Who knows how long, how long, how long
[03:49.69]She can go before she burns away
