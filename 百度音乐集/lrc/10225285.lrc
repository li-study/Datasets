[00:07.68]Lou Reed
[00:15.30]You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
[00:19.47]You believe it or not I wanted to play football for the coach
[00:27.44]And all those older guys
[00:29.15]They said he was mean and cruel, but you know
[00:33.62]Wanted to play football for the coach
[00:40.51]They said I was too little too light weight to play line-backer
[00:42.81]So I say I\'m playing right-end
[00:46.00]Wanted to play football for the coach
[00:53.15]\'Cause, you know some day, man
[00:55.07]You gotta stand up straight unless you\'re gonna fall
[00:58.57]Then you\'re gone to die
[01:04.83]And the straightest duel
[01:06.28]I ever knew was standing right for me all the time
[01:10.70]So I had to play football for the coach
[01:16.52]And I wanted to play football for the coach
[01:20.82]
[01:35.95]When you\'re all alone and lonely
[01:39.34]In your midnight hour
[01:48.36]And you find that your soul
[01:51.57]It\'s been up for sale
[01:54.49]
[02:00.67]And you begin to think about
[02:03.85]All of the things that you\'ve done
[02:12.97]And you begin to hate
[02:15.96]Just about everything
[02:18.01]
[02:27.62]But remember the princess who lived on the hill
[02:38.10]Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
[02:51.37]And right now she just might come shining through
[02:57.98]And the -
[03:00.59]- glory of love
[03:06.87]Glory of love
[03:12.94]Glory of love, just might come through
[03:24.73]And all your two-bit friends
[03:27.97]Have gone and ripped you off
[03:37.23]They\'re talking behind your back saying, man
[03:39.50]You\'re never going to be no human being
[03:42.19]
[03:51.64]And you start thinking again
[03:53.02]About all those things that you\'ve done
[03:59.80]And who it was and what it was
[04:03.01]And all the different things you made every different scene
[04:06.26]
[04:14.04]Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
[04:25.71]Something like a circus or a sewer
[04:37.68]And just remember different people have peculiar tastes
[04:44.91]And the -
[04:47.82]- glory of love
[04:52.84]The glory of love
[04:58.73]The glory of love, might see you through
[05:07.99]Yeah, but now, now
[05:10.50]Glory of love
[05:15.92]The glory of love
[05:21.63]The glory of love, might see you through
[05:26.34]
[05:33.46]Glory of love, ah, huh, huh, the glory of love
[05:43.73]Glory of love, glory of love
[05:49.60]Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
[05:55.14]Glory of love, now, now, now, glory of love
[06:00.89]Glory of love, give it to me now, glory of love see you through
[06:10.12]Oh, my coney island baby, now
