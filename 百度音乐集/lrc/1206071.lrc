[00:12.91]
[02:48.76][01:13.66][00:15.82]If she knew what she wants
[02:50.98][01:15.43][00:18.47](He'd be giving it to her)
[02:52.79][01:17.52][00:19.77]If she knew what she needs
[02:54.81][01:19.61][00:21.75](He could give her that too)
[02:56.91][01:21.38][00:23.59]If she knew what she wants
[02:59.03][01:23.33][00:25.62](But he can't see through her)
[03:00.51][01:25.30][00:27.58]If she knew what she wants
[03:03.01][01:27.72][00:29.81]He'd be giving it to her
[03:05.42][01:29.81][00:32.04]Giving it to her
[03:25.91][01:32.28]Giving it to her
[03:06.91][00:33.77]But she wants everything
[03:09.36][00:35.74](He can pretend to give her everything)
[03:10.83][00:37.71]Or there's nothing she wants
[03:12.69][00:39.63](She don't want to sort it out)
[03:14.69][00:41.67]He's crazy for this girl
[03:16.80][00:43.90](But she don't know what she's looking for)
[03:18.74][00:45.70]If she knew what she wants
[03:21.07][00:47.88]He'd be giving it to her
[03:23.08][00:50.00]Giving it to her
[03:27.87]He'd giving to her
[03:31.97]He'd giving her that too
[03:35.07]But he can't see through her
[03:38.08]Woo Woo........
[03:40.48]Giving it to her
[03:42.05]Giving it to her now !!!!!
[00:52.58]I'd say her values are corrupted
[00:55.90]But she's open to change
[00:59.04]Then one day she's satisfied
[01:01.29]And the next I'll find her crying
[01:03.63]And it's nothing she can explain
[02:02.24][01:07.32]

[01:37.88]Some have a style
[01:41.28]That they work hard to refine
[01:44.68]So they walk a crooked line
[01:50.93]But she won't understand
[01:55.52]Why anyone would have to try
[01:58.55]To walk a line when they could fly
[02:27.65]No sense thinking I could rehabilitate her
[02:31.34]When she's fine, fine, fine
[02:34.45]She's got so many ideas traveling around in her head
[02:39.29]She doesn't need nothing from mine
