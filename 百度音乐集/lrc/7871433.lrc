[00:02.21]LEARNING TO LIVE - Dream Theater
[00:11.60]
[01:34.45]There was no time for pain
[01:37.80]No energy for anger
[01:40.49]The sightlessness of hatred slips away
[01:45.99]Walking through winter streets alone
[01:49.22]He stops and takes a breath
[01:51.21]With confidence and self-control
[01:57.53]I look at the world and see no understanding
[02:02.56]I'm waiting to find some sense of strength
[02:08.13]I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to show me understanding
[02:19.63]I need to live life
[02:22.03]Like some people never will
[02:24.35]So find me kindness
[02:25.80]Find me beauty
[02:27.06]Find me truth
[02:30.15]When temptation brings me to my knees
[02:32.96]And I lay here drained of strength
[02:35.76]Show me kindness
[02:37.12]Show me beauty
[02:38.38]Show me truth
[02:41.40]The way your heart sounds makes all the difference
[02:45.11]It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
[02:49.26]The way your heart beats makes all the difference
[02:52.57]In learning to live
[02:57.57]Here before me is my soul
[03:00.89]I'm learning to live
[03:05.49]I won't give up
[03:06.83]Till I've no more to give
[03:11.00]
[03:19.47]Listening to the city
[03:22.66]Whispering its violence
[03:25.25]I set out watching from above
[03:29.79]The 90s bring new questions
[03:32.31]New solutions to be found
[03:35.04]I fell in love to be let down
[03:39.60]Once again we dance in the crowd
[03:42.96]At times a step away
[03:44.84]From a common fear that's all spread out
[03:48.07]It won't listen to what you say
[03:50.39]Once you're touched you stand alone
[03:53.14]To face the bitter fight
[03:55.89]Once I reached for love
[04:12.73]Another chance to lift my life
[04:16.11]Free the sensation in my heart
[04:20.49]To ride the wings of dreams into changing horizons
[04:26.19]It brings inner peace within my mind
[04:30.20]As I'm lifted from where I've spilt my life
[04:34.38]I hear an innocent voice
[04:36.91]I hear kindness, beauty and truth
[04:45.49]
[09:34.69]The way your heart sounds makes all the difference
[09:38.48]It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel
[09:42.37]The way your heart beats makes all the difference
[09:45.43]In learning to live
[09:50.41]Spread before you is your soul
[09:53.33]So forever hold the dreams within our hearts
[09:57.07]Through nature's inflexible grace
[10:00.36]I'm learning to live
