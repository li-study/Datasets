[00:06.00]
[00:08.40]When I get off of work on Friday
[00:11.13]after working like a dog all week
[00:14.39]I go to meet the boys for a cold one
[00:17.29]at a little joint up the street
[00:20.06]They got a jukebox in the corner
[00:23.38]full of old country tunes
[00:26.43]Feed it five dollars worth of quarters
[00:29.26]is the first thing I always do
[00:31.69]'Cause I need a little twang
[00:35.22]A little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
[00:41.45]Some peddle steel whining like
[00:43.06]a whistle of an old freight train
[00:46.86]To get that foot stomping honkey
[00:49.24]tonkin' feeling going through my veins
[00:53.35]I ned a little twang, twang, twang
[01:01.15]
[01:13.53]Well, I like a lot of kinds of music
[01:16.55]I try to keep an open mind
[01:19.81]Depending on the mood to strike me
[01:22.51]If I'm gonna stay till closing time
[01:25.72]So when I wanna lift my spirits to
[01:28.74]get me feeling worth a dang
[01:31.82]I know I'm gonna have to heart it
[01:34.62]'Cause I gotta have some Hank to hang
[01:36.91]'Cause I need a little twang
[01:40.59]A little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
[01:46.91]Some peddle steel whining like
[01:47.90]a whistle of an old freight train
[01:52.01]To get that foot stomping honkey
[01:54.00]tonkin' feeling going through my veins
[01:57.99]I ned a little twang, twang, twang
[02:01.22]
[02:10.36]'Cause I need a little twang
[02:13.37]A little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
[02:19.66]Some peddle steel whining like
[02:21.10]a whistle of an old freight train
[02:24.94]To get that foot stomping honkey
[02:26.99]tonkin' feeling going through my veins
[02:31.31]I ned a little twang, twang, twang
[02:37.54]I need a little twang, twang, twang
