[00:03.39]
[00:15.54]I'm keeping quiet til there's no more sirens
[00:19.22]Lately it's hard to keep the hinges on with all the noise
[00:22.96]I'll find my words when there's no one talking
[00:26.62]The room is spinning, I have got no choice
[00:31.70]Be patient, I am getting to the point.
[00:36.24]
[00:37.86]I can't remember when the earth turned slowly
[00:41.38]So I just waited with the lights turned out again
[00:45.09]I lost my place but I can't stop this story
[00:48.71]I've found my way, but until then
[00:53.06]I'm only spinning
[00:55.56]
[00:59.83]I'm keeping quiet til the phone stops ringing
[01:03.54]Lately it's hard to disconnect, I just want something real
[01:07.26]I've found the words if I could just stop thinking
[01:10.91]The room is spinning, I have got no choice
[01:16.00]Be patient, I am getting to the point.
[01:20.50]
[01:21.95]I can't remember when the earth turned slowly
[01:25.63]So I just waited with the lights turned out again
[01:29.31]I lost my place but I can't stop this story
[01:32.99]I've found my way, but until then
[01:35.26]I'm only spinning
[01:38.56]
[01:38.71]Spin beneath the rooftop
[01:40.64]Hold on, wait until the room stops

[01:56.97]So I just waited with the lights turned out again
[02:00.64]I lost my place but I can't stop this story
[02:04.35]I've found my way, but in the end
[02:06.61]We're only spinning
[02:07.99]
[02:08.20]I keep forgetting when the earth turned slowly
[02:11.96]So I just waited til the lights come on again
[02:15.41]I lost my place but I can't stop this story
[02:19.14]I've found my way, but until then
[02:21.85]I'm only spinning
