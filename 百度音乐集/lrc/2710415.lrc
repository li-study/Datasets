[00:20.18]Oh Danny boy
[00:23.02]The pipes the pipes are calling
[00:28.05]From glenn to glenn
[00:31.72]And down the mountain side
[00:37.84]The summer's gone
[00:40.35]And all the flowers are falling
[00:46.76]'Tis you, 'tis you must go
[00:52.26]And I must bye
[00:56.80]But come ye back
[01:05.18]When summer's in the meadow
[01:14.50]Or when the valley's hushed
[01:25.42]And white with snow
[01:34.01]'Tis I'll be there
[01:42.27]In Sunshine or in shadow
[01:55.25]Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy
[02:05.21]I love you so
[02:14.95]
[02:45.66]And when ye come
[02:48.72]And all the flowers are dying
[02:57.98]If I am dead
[03:04.41]As dead I well may be
[03:14.84]You'll come and find
[03:18.91]The place where I am lying
[03:29.02]And kneel and say an Ave
[03:40.62]For me
[03:46.69]And I shall hear
[03:55.50]The soft you tread above me
[04:07.10]And all my grave
[04:14.87]Will warm and sweeter be
[04:25.92]If you will bend
[04:34.28]And tell me
[04:40.93]That you love me
[04:52.61]Then I shall sleep in peace
[05:00.79]Until you come to me
[05:13.72]
