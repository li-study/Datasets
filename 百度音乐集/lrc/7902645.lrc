[00:04.00]Jessica Simpson
[00:06.00]
[00:11.90]Watchin' every motion
[00:14.37]In my foolish lover's game
[00:21.71]On this endless ocean
[00:24.19]Finally lovers know no shame
[00:31.41]Turnin' and returnin'
[00:33.57]To some secret place inside
[00:40.73]Watchin' in slow motion
[00:42.98]As you turn around and say
[00:48.19]My love
[00:49.40]Take my breath away
[00:58.88]Take my breath away
[01:02.85]
[01:09.58]Watchin' I keep waiting
[01:11.89]Still anticipatin' love
[01:19.33]Never hesitatin'
[01:21.50]To become the fated  ones
[01:28.95]Turnin' and returnin'
[01:31.08]To some secret place inside
[01:38.64]Watchin' in slow motion
[01:40.77]As you turn around and say
[01:45.63]My love
[01:46.99]Take my breath away
[01:56.49]Take my breath away
[02:02.68]
[02:07.39]Through the hourglass  I saw you
[02:11.64]In time you slipped away
[02:17.00]When the mirror crashed  I called you
[02:21.25]And turned to hear you say
[02:25.20]If only for today
[02:29.87]I am unafraid
[02:34.96]Take my breath away
[02:44.46]You take my breath away
[02:55.83]You take my breath
[03:01.87]Away
[03:05.52]You take my breath away
[03:07.53]You take my breath away
