[00:12.76]I’d rather dance with you than talk with you
[00:18.05]So why don’t we just move into the other room
[00:24.91]There’s space for us to shake, and hey, I like this tune
[00:31.80]
[00:35.34]Even if I could hear what you said
[00:40.16]I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear
[00:46.55]Because I haven’t read a single book all year
[00:53.48]And the only film I saw, I didn’t like it at all
[01:10.75]
[01:12.88]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[01:17.38]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[01:24.15]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[01:30.55]
[01:38.18]The music’s too loud and the noise from the crowd
[01:41.12]Increases the chance of misinterpretation
[01:44.73]So let your hips do the talking
[01:49.45]I’ll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings
[01:56.32]And you’ll make me smile by really getting into the swing
[02:00.57]Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
[02:03.78]Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
[02:05.86]Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
[02:09.22]Getting into the swing, getting into the swing...
[02:14.00]
[02:16.01](Getting into the swing...)
[02:19.31]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[02:24.63]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[02:33.43]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[02:39.57]I’d rather dance, I’d rather dance than talk with you
[02:54.56]I’d rather dance with you
[02:59.31]I’d rather dance with you
[03:02.91]
