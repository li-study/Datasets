[00:04.20]
[00:09.29]It's colder than winter
[00:16.40]Right here in my heart
[00:23.68]Lord, I'm gonna miss her
[00:31.14]She's torn me apart
[00:35.31]
[00:38.32]I couldn't make you love me
[00:45.20]I couldn't give you any more
[00:52.95]It's colder than winter
[01:00.01]Since you closed the door
[01:38.87]
[01:40.53]It's colder than winter
[01:47.62]I'm freezin' inside
[01:54.85]And my tears won't be bitter
[02:02.07]Even though our love died
[02:08.53]
[02:09.80]I couldn't make you love me
[02:16.02]I couldn't give you anymore
[02:23.94]It's colder than winter
[02:31.06]Since you closed the door
[01:05.63]
[01:07.38]Every time the sun sets
[01:14.93]I shed another tear
[01:21.97]And the lonelier I get
[01:28.59]Wishing you were still here
[03:05.22][01:35.62]
[03:08.18]I couldn't make you love me
[03:14.23]I couldn't give you any more
[03:22.19]It's colder than winter
[03:29.11]Since you closed the door
[03:35.12]
[03:36.80]It's colder than winter
[03:44.13]Since you closed the door
[03:55.68]
