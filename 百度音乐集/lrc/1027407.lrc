[00:11.38]——chantal kreviazuk
[00:12.90]What's this life anyway?
[00:16.06]What's it to you and me?
[00:19.50]What's it to anyone?
[00:22.53]Who are we supposed to be?
[00:25.94]Make me a storybook
[00:29.79]Write me away from here
[00:34.19]I need a different now
[00:39.00]Where we can wear each other for awhile
[00:46.86]I'll len you my tears if I could borrow a smile
[00:54.07]I'll get through tomorrow somehow today
[01:03.23]Happy After...
[01:07.37]Once upon these days
[01:15.23]There's four roads to anywhere
[01:18.58]Four ways to everything
[01:21.90]We were unbreakable
[01:25.32]We spoke our destiny
[01:28.84]Let's take a moment out
[01:31.84]Go were we never go
[01:36.67]Let's make a new world now
[01:41.53]Where we can wear each other for awhile
[01:48.95]I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow your smile
[01:55.18]We'll get through tomorrow somehow today
[02:05.72]Happy After...
[02:09.82]Once upon these days
[02:18.84]Then one day we'll find
[02:20.51]when we're looking back at this time
[02:22.16]Wondering how we've come so far from this
[02:25.40]When we close our eyes
[02:36.97]What's this life anyway
[02:38.76]What's it to you and me
[02:41.04]What are we doing here
[02:44.34]Who are we supposed to be
[02:48.45]I'll take a better world
[02:52.36]I'll take anything
[02:55.78]I'll take our little world now
[03:00.56]Where we can wear each other for awhile
[03:09.57]I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow your smile
[03:13.72]We'll get through tomorrow somehow today
[03:24.57]Happy After...
[03:29.20]Once upon these days
