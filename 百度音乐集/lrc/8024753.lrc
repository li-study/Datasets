[00:15.99]It takes a lot to know what is love
[00:22.86]It's not the big things, but the little things
[00:26.00]That can mean enough
[00:29.40]A lot of prayers to get me through
[00:34.02]And there is never a day that passes by
[00:39.34]I don't think of you
[00:43.27]You were always there for me
[00:49.27]Pushing me and guiding me
[00:52.63]Always to succeed
[03:12.76][02:17.73][00:56.93]You showed me
[03:15.74][02:20.86][00:59.86]When I was young just how to grow
[03:19.50][02:24.68][01:03.63]You showed me
[03:22.52][02:27.62][01:06.54]Everything that I should know
[03:25.96][02:30.57][01:10.30]You showed me
[03:29.34][02:34.12][01:13.20]Just how to walk without your hands
[03:32.57][02:37.37][01:17.07]'Cause mom you always were
[03:36.08][02:40.61][01:19.63]The perfect fan
[01:37.16]God has been so good
[01:43.68]Blessing me with a family
[01:47.17]Who did all they could
[01:50.63]And I've had many years of grace
[01:57.15]And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
[02:03.92]I wanna thank you for what you've done
[02:07.80]In hopes I can give back to you
[02:13.94]And be the perfect son
[02:45.30]You showed me how to love
[02:51.74]You showed me how to care
[02:58.51]And you showed me that you would
[03:02.65]always be there
[03:05.26]I wanna thank you for that time
[03:08.80]And I'm proud to say you're mine
[03:43.84]'Cause mom you always were,
[03:46.02]mom you always were
[03:47.61]Mom you always were,
[03:49.56]you know you always were
[03:52.79]'Cause mom you always were...
[03:55.16] the perfect fan
[04:05.05]I love you mom
