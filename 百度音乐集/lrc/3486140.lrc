[00:00.68]This is the morning
[00:01.07]if we got away in the morning
[00:04.53]with the sun or the rain in our eyes
[00:11.48]we'd travel thru sleepy night times
[00:17.38]we won't follow the stars or the light
[00:23.38]
[00:28.10]if lies you tell can make it better
[00:32.46]and hopeless dreams can make your day
[00:36.67]you don't have to leave your friends
[00:41.81]this is the morning
[00:46.51]
[00:47.37]with no temper, changing with the weather
[00:52.50]just a harmless call in the night
[00:56.73]you don't have to leave your friends
[01:01.50]this is the morning
