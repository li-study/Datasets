[00:01.00]MORE THAN A WOMAN
[00:06.00]Bee Gees
[00:08.00]Oh, girl I've known you very well
[00:11.00]I've seen you growing everyday
[00:13.00]I never really looked before
[00:16.00]but now you take my breath away.
[00:18.00]Suddenly you're in my life
[00:20.00]part of everything I do
[00:22.00]you got me working day and night
[00:25.00]just trying to keep a hold on you.
[00:27.00]Here in your arms I found my paradise
[00:32.00]my only chance for happiness
[00:36.00]and if I lose you now I think I would die.
[01:50.00][00:40.00]Oh say you'll always be my baby
[01:53.00][00:43.00]we can make it shine, we can take forever
[01:57.00][00:47.00]just a minute at a time.
[02:55.00][02:38.00][02:03.00][00:52.00]More than a woman, more than a woman to me
[02:59.00][02:41.00][02:12.00][01:01.00]more than a woman, more than a woman to me
[01:19.00]There are stories old and true
[01:21.00]of people so in love like you and me
[01:24.00]and I can see myself
[01:26.00]let history repeat itself.
[01:28.00]Reflecting how I feel for you
[01:30.00]thinking about those people then
[01:32.00]I know that in a thousand years
[01:35.00]I'd fall in love with you again.
[01:37.00]This is the only way that we should fly
[01:42.00]this is the only way to go
[01:46.00]and if I lose you I know I would die.
[02:50.00][02:32.00]more than a woman, oh, oh, oh.
