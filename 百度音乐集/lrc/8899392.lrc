[00:09.84]You took a chance
[00:11.02]And I learned how to deal with my life
[00:18.64]You had to go
[00:19.69]I had nothing
[00:21.48]Just nothing but why
[00:25.86]Why everything's broken
[00:30.42]Why should I stay open
[00:34.79]Open for you
[00:37.14]
[00:37.64]But then my heart skipped a breath, whoa, whoa
[00:46.38]Without a beat I forget. so, so, no
[00:55.38]And I'm not ready to loose it all, whoa, whoa
