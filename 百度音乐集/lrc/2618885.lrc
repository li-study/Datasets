[00:16.22]Welcome to the planet
[00:23.13]Welcome to existence
[00:34.20][00:31.25]Everyone's here
[00:38.01]Everybody's watching you now
[00:44.87]Everybody waits for you now
[00:54.87][00:51.75]What happens next
[03:20.46][02:11.49][00:58.27]I dare you to move
[03:23.58][02:15.02][01:01.62]I dare you to move
[03:27.29][02:18.43][01:05.22]I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
[03:33.83][02:25.28][01:11.74]I dare you to move

[01:44.19]Welcome to resistence
[01:54.88][01:51.62]The tension is here
[01:58.70]Between who you are and you could be
[02:04.20]Between how it is and how it should be
[02:39.75]Maybe redemption has stories to tell
[02:46.14]Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
[02:52.93]Where can you run to escape from yourself?
[02:59.72]Where you gonna go?
[03:03.01]Where you gonna go?
[03:06.36]Salvation is here
