[00:58.42]Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
[01:06.13]We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
[01:14.80]We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
[01:24.47]Time hurries by, we're here and we're gone
[03:24.11][01:33.68]Looking for the light of a new love
[03:31.32][01:40.71]To brighten up the night, i have you love
[03:40.72][01:49.53]And we can face the music together
