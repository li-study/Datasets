[00:25.04]Three months in here
[00:31.03]Can't catch the tears
[00:37.21]Time never lands
[00:42.78]Our love is all that stands now
[00:49.14]Streets feel strange
[00:56.12]And longer lives can never change
[01:00.24]I'm so glad to have you
[01:03.19]And it's getting worse
[01:06.15]I'm so mad to love you
[01:09.14]And your evil curse
[01:12.41]I feel out of place
[01:18.31]Just look at my face
[01:24.44]Stuck in the mud
[01:30.59]Knee-deep in blood girl
[01:34.33]
[01:36.57]Eyes, blind fold
[01:43.42]You never said I'm growing old
[01:59.51][01:47.65]I'm so glad to have you
[02:02.48][01:50.60]And it's getting worse
[02:05.42][01:53.56]I'm so mad to love you
[02:08.40][01:56.52]And your evil curse

[02:35.14](Sample: My my my heart is still reliant/very light)
[02:46.62]
[02:47.70]Tell them I've gone
[02:53.72]And nothing's wrong
[02:59.53]In from the past
[03:05.44]A sudden blast bang
[03:09.24]
[03:11.41]Spring has gone
[03:18.37]And summer keeps on coming on
[03:46.19][03:34.31][03:22.43]I'm so glad to have you
[03:49.16][03:37.27][03:25.42]And it's getting worse
[03:52.11][03:40.23][03:28.38]I'm so mad to love you
[03:55.07][03:43.22][03:31.36]And your evil curse
[03:58.05]I've a plan to save you
[04:00.98]From my misery
[04:03.96]I'm a man too brave to follow history
[04:09.87]Lalalalalalalala...
