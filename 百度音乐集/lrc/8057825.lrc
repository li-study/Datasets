[00:06.00]豆豆，我们相爱一年了，OH YEAH,让我死在你的怀中吧，因为你是这么可爱,让你的爱情化为吻 朝我的眼和嘴唇倾洒
[00:33.10]Each place I go only the lonely go
[00:48.19]Some little small cafe?
[00:57.10]The songs I know only the lonely know
[01:08.49]Each melody recalls a love that used to be
[01:20.20]The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
[01:31.06]Of lips as warm as May
[01:39.48]That hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme
[01:48.92]That soon somewhere you\'ll find a love that used to care
[01:59.65]And you\'ll recall each fun time
[02:10.05]Those picnics at the beach when love was new
[02:19.78]It well could be the one time
[02:30.38]A hopeless little dream like that comes true
[02:40.81]If you find love hang on to each caress
[02:56.16]And never let love go
[03:07.72]For when it\'s gone you\'ll know the loneliness
[03:19.59]The heartbreak only the lonely know
[03:34.85]
