[00:-2.00]Plain White T's - Rhythm Of Love
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.00]
[00:07.09]My head is stuck in the clouds
[00:09.77]She begs me to come down
[00:12.06]Says "Boy quit foolin' around"
[00:16.27]
[00:17.16]I told her "I love the view from up here
[00:20.98]The warm sun and wind in my ear
[00:23.18]We'll watch the world from above
[00:27.20]As it turns to the rhythm of love"
[00:30.33]
[00:31.21]We may only have tonight
[00:36.31]But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
[00:43.83]Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
[00:50.03]
[00:54.52]My heart beats like a drum
[00:57.28]A guitar string to the strum
[00:59.42]A beautiful song to be sung
[01:04.26]
[01:04.86]She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
[01:08.35]That roll back when she's laughing at me
[01:10.60]She rises up like the tide
[01:14.92]The moment her lips meet mine
[01:18.00]
[01:18.75]We may only have tonight
[01:23.91]But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
[01:31.37]Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
[01:37.25]
[01:42.32]When the moon is low
[01:47.65]We can dance in slow motion
[01:53.98]And all your tears will subside
[01:59.75]All your tears will dry
[02:05.19]
[02:26.64]And long after I've gone
[02:29.31]You'll still be humming along
[02:31.45]And I will keep you in my mind
[02:36.00]The way you make love so fine
[02:58.25][02:39.05]
[02:59.60][02:39.75]We may only have tonight
[02:44.84]But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
[02:59.60][02:52.01]Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love...
