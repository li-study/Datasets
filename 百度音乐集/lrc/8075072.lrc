[00:17.16]It was bout five till five on Friday
[00:20.18]We were all getting ready to go
[00:23.61]And the boss man started screaming
[00:26.41]And his veins began to show
[00:28.73]
[00:29.17]He said you and you come with me
[00:32.56]'Cause you're gonna have to stay
[00:35.23]My heart was thumping, I was jumping
[00:39.26]I had to get away
[00:41.15]
[00:41.94]Some days you gotta dance
[00:45.01]Live it up when you get the chance
[00:48.08]'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
[00:50.64]And you're feeling just a little too tense
[00:53.53]Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
[00:57.77]
[01:02.32]Well, I was talking with my baby
[01:05.11]Over a small glass of tea
[01:08.17]He asked the loaded question
[01:11.57]He said how do you feel about me
[01:13.81]
[01:14.34]My mind was racin', I was pacin'
[01:17.43]But the word just wouldn't come
[01:20.42]And there was only one thing
[01:22.05]Left to do I feel it comin' on
[01:26.58]
[01:27.18]Some days you gotta dance
[01:30.22]Live it up when you get the chance
[01:32.81]'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
[01:35.79]And you're feeling just a little too tense
[01:38.44]Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
[01:43.05]
[02:04.85]Some days you gotta dance
[02:07.44]Live it up when you get the chance
[02:10.56]'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
[02:13.49]And you're feeling just a little too tense
[02:16.21]Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
