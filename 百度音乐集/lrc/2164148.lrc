[00:03.01]Eagles
[00:04.50]
[02:09.30]On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
[02:16.11]Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
[02:22.39]Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
[02:28.76]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[02:31.93]I had to stop for the night
[02:35.40]There she stood in the doorway
[02:38.60]I heard the mission bell
[02:40.18]
[02:42.04]And I was thinking to myself
[02:43.99]'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
[02:48.27]Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
[02:54.69]There were voices down the corridor
[02:57.85]I thought I heard them say
[03:01.03]Welcome to the Hotel California
[03:06.52]Such a lovely place
[03:09.91]Such a lovely face
[03:13.45]Plenty of room at the Hotel California
[03:19.52]Any time of year, you can find it here
[03:26.46]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
[03:32.80]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
[03:39.43]How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
[03:45.59]Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
[03:50.83]
[03:52.07]So I called up the Captain,
[03:55.27]'Please bring me my wine
[03:57.82]He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
[04:04.94]And still those voices are calling from far away
[04:11.39]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[04:14.58]Just to hear them say
[04:17.76]Welcome to the Hotel California
[04:23.31]Such a lovely place
[04:26.64]Such a lovely face
[04:30.29]They livin' it up at the Hotel California
[04:36.30]What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
[04:42.28]
[04:43.67]Mirrors on the ceiling,
[04:46.97]The pink champagne on ice,And she said
[04:50.29]We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
[04:56.75]And in the master's chambers
[05:00.12]They gathered for the feast
[05:03.24]The stab it with their steely knives
[05:06.12]But they just can't kill the beast
[05:09.70]Last thing I remember, I was
[05:13.06]Running for the door
[05:16.50]I had to find the passage back
[05:18.81]To the place I was before
[05:22.64]'Relax,'said the night man
[05:25.32]We are programmed to receive
[05:29.00]You can checkout any time you like
[05:32.33]but you can never leave
[05:34.00]
