[00:19.25]I've been feeling lonesome
[00:25.00]I'm down, don't know what to do
[00:32.75]I let you lie to me
[00:34.09]plant seeds inside
[00:34.98]to see them grow
[00:37.31]only to leave them to die
[00:38.78]
[00:41.18]I learned my lesson
[00:47.76]I won't be forgetting
[00:48.84]I won't give my heart out
[00:49.93]without suspecting
[00:52.49]why cry
[00:58.33]why cry
[01:03.65]why cry
[01:08.61]for you

[02:01.98]why cry
[02:07.26]for you
[02:17.63]

[02:35.62]without suspecting
[02:44.19]why cry
[02:46.69]why cry
[02:55.31]why cry
