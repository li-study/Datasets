[00:16.14]Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high
[00:30.47]There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
[00:44.50]Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue
[00:58.49]And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
[01:11.23]
[01:12.16]Someday I'll wish upon a star
[01:15.36]And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
[01:24.34]Where troubles smelled like lemon drops
[01:27.85]Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me
[01:37.98]
[01:38.98]Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly
[01:52.72]Birds fly over the rainbow, Why, then oh why, can't I

[02:46.32]Where troubles smelled like lemon drops
[02:49.50]Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me
[02:59.74]
[03:00.21]Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly
[03:13.76]Birds fly over the rainbow, Why, then oh why, can't I
