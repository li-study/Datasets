[00:15.42]My Grandpa said to me,
[00:19.63]"grandson sit down we need to talk
[00:23.97]in life, there may be times
[00:27.54]when it gets hard to walk the walk.
[00:31.71]It's easier to take the path
[00:35.44]that most have traveled on.
[00:39.77]But then again sometimes to do
[00:44.29]what's right you must walk alone."
[00:47.65]
[00:48.33]And that is a lonely road
[00:53.50]Ohh
[00:54.79]When this world burns down
[00:58.66]Deep in your soul
[01:01.66]Ohh
[01:02.75]You will find there's a piece left behind
[01:10.54]You will find there's a piece to find
[01:18.62](Piece to find)
[01:21.97]
[01:23.06]Some people are unkind to those
[01:28.55]who see things different, oh
[01:31.72]We've all felt pain in ways
[01:35.13]it hurts to even bring it up
[01:39.10]But that don't mean that patience
[01:42.69]Take this motion lying down
[01:47.35]I'll stand and fight until the day
[01:51.88]they put me in the ground
[01:54.98]
[01:55.92]And that is a lonely road
[02:00.83]Ohh
[02:02.10]When this world burns down
[02:06.08]Deep in your soul
[02:10.09]You will find there's a piece behind
[02:18.03]You will find there's a piece to find
[02:27.32]
[02:30.64]And now I've taught you all I know
[02:35.79]So take this seed and let it grow
[02:46.57]Though I'm here now, I'll soon be gone
[02:52.05]I did what i can to try it make it strong
[02:56.07](I did what i can to try it make it strong)
[03:00.62](I can see that you're strong)
[03:03.31]
[03:03.99]And that is a lonely road
[03:08.98]Ohh
[03:10.59]When this world burns down
[03:13.88]Deep in your soul
[03:17.63]You will find there's a piece behind
[03:25.52]You will find there's a piece to find
[03:33.73]
