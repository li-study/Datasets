[00:01.80]The Jesus and Mary Chain - Cut Dead
[00:04.74]
[00:24.42]What can I do
[00:28.01]It's gotten me beaten black and blue
[00:33.34]Why don't you know
[00:37.20]You got me moving much too slow
[00:42.50]Why can't you see
[00:46.13]You got me chasing honey bees
[00:51.66]You made me fall
[00:55.59]Broke me up and took it all
[01:01.01]Call me your messed up boy
[01:05.32]
[01:23.79]Just what I've found
[01:27.68]You knock my body to the ground
[01:32.98]Just what I've said
[01:36.76]You're tearing up my weary head
[01:42.09]Do I still shine
[01:45.99]After such a lonely time
[01:51.23]You cut me dead
[01:55.36]You nail me down and kick my head
[02:00.48]Cut dead your messed up boy
[02:03.95]
[02:31.45]Hey hey hey
[02:35.49]Hey hey hey
[02:40.17]Hey hey hey
[02:44.51]
[02:46.02]End~~~
