[00:04.28]Cigarettes and chocolate milk
[00:14.89]These are just a couple of my cravings
[00:19.81]Everything it seems I likes a little bit stronger
[00:24.39]A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me
[00:29.80]If I should buy jellybeans
[00:34.42]Have to eat them all in just one sitting
[00:39.33]Everything it seems I likes a little bit sweeter
[00:44.10]A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me
[00:49.01]And then theres those other things
[00:53.88]Which for several reasons we wont mention
[00:58.80]Everything about em is a little bit stranger, a little bit harder
[01:05.93]A little bit deadly
[01:08.32]Its not very smart
[01:18.46]Tends to make one part
[01:26.36]So brokenhearted
[01:38.12]Sitting here remembering me
[01:42.86]Always been a shoe made for the city
[01:47.65]Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
[01:52.46]With scrappy boys faces have general run of the town
[01:57.70]Playing with prodigal sons
[02:02.47]Take a lot of sentimental valiums
[02:07.36]Cant expect the world to be your raggedy andy
[02:11.94]While running on empty you little old doll with a frown
[02:17.43]You got to keep in the game
[02:22.04]Retaining mystique while facing forward
[02:26.93]I suggest a reading of lesson in tightropes
[02:31.67]Or surfing your high hopes or adios kansas
[02:36.33]Its not very smart
[02:46.53]Tends to make one part
[02:54.27]So brokenhearted
[03:23.80]Still theres not a show on my back
[03:28.25]Holes or a friendly intervention
[03:32.67]Im just a little bit heiress, a little bit irish
[03:38.57]A little bit tower of pisa
[03:44.29]Whenever I see ya
[03:46.94]So please be kind if Im a mess
