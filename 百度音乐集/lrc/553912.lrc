[00:04.99]Live Like You Were Dying
[00:12.55]Tim McGraw
[00:18.47]
[00:23.67]He said I was in my early forties
[00:27.19]with a lot of life before me
[00:30.04]when a moment came that stopped me on a dime
[00:35.83]and I spent most of the next days
[00:39.29]looking at the x-rays
[00:42.51]Talking bout the options
[00:44.87]and talking bout sweet time
[00:48.70]I asked him when it sank in
[00:51.88]that this might really be the real end
[00:53.79]how's it hit you when you get that kinda news
[00:59.35]man what'd you do
[01:00.70]and he said
[01:00.88]
[01:02.52]I went sky diving
[01:05.67]I went Rocky Mountain climbing
[01:08.38]I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named FuManchu
[01:14.10]and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
[01:20.32]and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
[01:26.78]and he said someday I hope you get the chance
[01:31.23]to live like you were dying.
[01:36.24]
[01:43.76]He said I was finally the husband
[01:48.43]that most the time I wasn't
[01:51.06]and I became a friend a friend would like to have
[01:56.53]and all the sudden going fishin
[01:59.84]wasn't such an imposition
[02:02.77]and I went three times that year I lost my dad
[02:08.47]well I finally read the good book
[02:11.48]and I took a good long hard look
[02:15.10]at what I'd do if I could do it all again
[02:19.47]
[02:20.38]and then
[02:23.18]I went sky diving
[02:26.52]I went Rocky Mountain climbing
[02:29.68]I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named FuManchu
[02:35.39]and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
[02:41.76]and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
[02:47.67]and he said someday I hope you get the chance
[02:52.25]to live like you were dying.
[02:56.65]
[02:57.08]Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity
[03:01.29]to think about
[03:02.91]what'd you do with it
[03:05.72]what did you do with it
[03:08.33]what did I do with it
[03:11.32]what would I do with it'
[03:14.16]
[03:14.68]Sky diving
[03:17.36]I went Rocky Mountain climbing
[03:20.41]I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named FuManchu
[03:26.50]and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
[03:32.57]and I watched an eagle as it was flying
[03:41.37]and he said someday I hope you get the chance
[03:46.13]to live like you were dying.
[03:52.35]To live like you were dying
[03:58.40]To live like you were dying
