[01:00.00]Filling with fear I’m getting cold again
[01:04.65]Losing my grip and I slip now he’s pulling me under
[01:11.14]Drowning in my old friend
[01:15.59]Caught in the swell I have to keep my nerve
[01:19.66]Swallow me whole
[01:21.17]Your control leaves me dead in the water
[01:26.24]Dead in the water
[01:31.15]Stormy night I’m washed ashore
[01:34.44]I catch my breath and wait for dawn
[01:38.92]I catch my death I’m back for more
[01:45.19]As the tides they bring me home
[01:50.06](Waves crashing down over me)
[01:53.50]Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
[01:56.89](Floating to the surface from the blue)
[01:59.94]Like the sea as it leaves me cold
[02:03.51](Waves crashing down over me)
[02:07.42]Your spirit has been overthrown and it’s drowning
[02:13.37]
[02:18.15]A moment gone i'll be back you
[02:23.05]I am the one I am strong kept my head above water
[02:29.41]Sailing away from you
[02:35.18]Your love is like a hurricane
[02:39.00]Devastating, wracked with pain
[02:42.39]I won’t be scared I’m not afraid
[02:49.00]As the tides they bring me home
[02:53.85](Waves crashing down over me)
[02:57.67]Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
[03:01.54](Floating to the surface from the blue)
[03:04.66]Like the sea as it leaves me cold
[03:07.81](Waves crashing down over me)
[03:11.65]Your spirit has been overthrown and it’s drowning
[03:17.66]
[03:48.30]As the tides they bring me home
[03:53.71](Waves crashing down over me)
[03:57.01]Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
[04:00.77](Floating to the surface from the blue)
[04:04.03]Like the sea as it leaves me cold
[04:08.60](Waves crashing down over me)
[04:11.72]Your spirit has been overthrown and it’s drowning
[04:18.68]As the tides they bring me home
[04:26.82]Your spirit has been overthrown and it’s drowning
