[00:04.99]You asked me what I want.
[00:07.96]You asked me what I need.
[00:11.18]It's nothing you can buy.
[00:13.90]My heart's not ruled by greed.
[00:17.54]I don't give diamond.
[00:20.45]Cause diamonds you see through.
[00:23.81]I want you to hold me.
[00:26.69]I want you to be true.
[03:10.40][02:39.26][01:37.19][00:33.32]Give me the gift of love.
[03:14.74][02:43.51][01:41.45][00:37.66]Look me in the eyes.
[03:17.83][02:46.53][01:44.41][00:40.78]Say I'm the one you're dreaming of.
[03:22.45][02:50.82][01:49.09][00:45.48]That would be the best surprise.
[03:27.20][02:55.94][01:53.89][00:50.09]Give me the gift of your sweet love,
[03:32.82][03:01.91][01:59.66][00:56.01]in the light of the day,
[03:36.07][03:04.85][02:02.91][00:59.07]in the dark of night.
[03:43.47][02:08.65][01:03.90]
[01:08.63]Like the colors of the sun,
[01:11.57]the feelings in your heart.
[01:14.69]It's all I want from you.
[01:17.59]And when the sky is dark,
[01:20.84]I'll have you beside me
[01:23.93]who could ask for more.
[01:27.39]I'll just wear a smile
[01:30.26]when you walk in the door
