[00:20.78] Lyrics：
[00:25.11]The Look of Love
[00:28.03]
[00:32.60]The look of love
[00:37.41]Is in your eyes
[00:43.01]The look your smile can't disguise
[00:53.54]The look of love
[00:59.24]Is saying so much more
[01:03.99]Than just words could ever say
[01:10.15]And what my heart has heard
[01:13.88]Well it takes my breath away
[01:17.92]
[01:18.13]I can hardly wait to hold you
[01:21.62]Feel my arms around you
[01:25.28]How long I have waited
[01:29.12]Waited just to love you
[01:30.81]Now that I have found you
[01:32.78]
[01:34.67]You've got the look of love
[01:40.96]It's on your face
[01:46.20]A look that time can't erase
[01:56.59]Be mine tonight
[02:03.14]Let this be just the start
[02:07.08]Of so many nights like this
[02:13.03]Let's take a lover's vow
[02:17.26]And then seal it with a kiss
[02:21.54]
[02:21.88]I can hardly wait to hold you
[02:25.42]Feel my arms around you
[02:28.30]How long I have waited
[02:31.88]Waited just to love you
[02:34.01]Now that I have found you
[02:38.44]Don't ever go
[02:42.97]Don't ever go
[02:48.10]I love you so
[03:06.81]
[03:33.98]I can hardly wait to hold you
[03:38.60]Feel my arms around you
[03:41.57]How long I have waited
[03:44.59]Waited just to love you
[03:46.41]Now that I have found you
[03:51.82]Don't ever go
[03:56.91]Don't ever go
[04:02.84]Don't ever go
