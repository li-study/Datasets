[00:30.45]
[00:35.11]In the year of '39
[00:37.47]assembled here the Volunteers.
[00:39.78]In the days when lands were few.
[00:44.78]Here the ship sailed out
[00:46.96]into the blue and sunny morning.
[00:49.93]The sweetest sight ever seen !
[00:53.00]<Music>
[00:54.21]" And the night followed day. "
[00:56.67]And the story tellers say :
[00:59.00]" That the score brave souls inside.
[01:03.71]For many a lonely day
[01:06.02]sailed across the milky seas.
[01:08.21]Ne'er looked back,
[01:09.62]never feared,
[01:10.66]never cried. "
[01:11.96]<Music>
[01:13.14]Don't you hear my call
[01:15.21]though you're many years away ?
[01:17.79]Don't you hear me calling you ?
[01:22.37]Write your letters in the sand
[01:24.66]for the day I take your hand
[01:27.05]in the land that our
[01:28.76]grandchildren knew.

[02:02.00]In the year of '39,
[02:04.51]came a ship in from the blue.
[02:06.90]The Volunteers came home that day.
[02:11.55]And they bring good news
[02:13.72]of a world so newly born,
[02:16.22]though their hearts so heavily weight.
[02:20.92]For the earth is old and grey,
[02:23.11]little darling we'll away
[02:25.67]but my love this cannot be.
[02:30.21]For so many years have gone
[02:32.66]though I'm older but a year.
[02:34.84]Your mother's eyes
[02:36.17]from your eyes
[02:37.10]cry to me.
[02:39.26]Don't you hear my call
[02:41.73]though you're many years away ?
[02:44.27]Don't you hear me calling you ?
[02:49.05]Write your letters in the sand
[02:51.46]for the day I take your hands.
[02:53.81]In the land that our
[02:55.48]grandchildren knew.
[02:58.49]Don't you hear my call
[03:00.66]though you're many years away ?
[03:03.23]Don't you hear me calling you ?
[03:07.74]All your letters in the sand
[03:10.27]cannot heal me like your hand.
[03:12.64]For my life !
[03:14.27]Still ahead !
[03:15.34]Pity Me !
