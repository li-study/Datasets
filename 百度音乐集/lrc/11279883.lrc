[00:15.89]
[00:21.03]At last my love has come along
[00:36.28]My lonely days are over
[00:44.16]And life is like a song
[00:52.20]Ohh yeah yeah
[00:55.38]At last
[01:00.31]The skies above are blue
[01:08.46]My heart was wrapped up in clover
[01:16.51]The night I looked at you
[01:26.34]I found a dream, that I could speak to
[01:34.60]A dream that I can call my own
[01:42.58]I found a thrill to press my cheek to
[01:50.65]A thrill that I have never known
[01:57.43]Ohh yeah yeah
[01:59.60]You smile, you smile
[02:04.39]Oh and then the spell was cast
[02:13.79]And here we are in heaven
[02:20.67]For you are mine at last
