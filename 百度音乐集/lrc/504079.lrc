[00:00.47]You Lost Me
[00:01.75]Christina Aguilera
[00:02.61]
[00:05.19]I am done, smoking gun
[00:14.55]We've lost it all, the love is gone
[00:24.07]She has won. Now it's no fun
[00:33.44]We've lost it all, the love is gone
[00:40.31]
[00:44.08]And we had magic
[00:48.64]And this is tragic
[00:53.92]You couldn't keep your hands to yourself
[01:00.48]
[01:02.88]I feel like our world's been infected
[01:11.77]And somehow you left me neglected
[01:22.03]We found our life's been changed
[01:30.47]Babe, You Lost Me
[01:36.19]
[01:39.86]And we tried, oh how we cried
[01:49.06]We lost ourselves, the love has died
[01:58.31]And oh, we tried, you can't deny
[02:07.75]We're left as shells, we lost the fight
[02:15.58]
[02:18.78]And we had magic
[02:23.41]And this is tragic
[02:28.85]You couldn't keep your hands to yourself
[02:36.65]
[02:37.84]I feel like our world's been infected
[02:47.19]And somehow you left me neglected
[02:56.91]We found our life's been changed
[03:05.31]Babe, you lost me
[03:10.80]
[03:11.21]Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet
[03:15.58]But you chose lust when you deceived me
[03:20.40]You'll regret it but it's too late
[03:25.33]How can I ever trust you again'
[03:29.70]
[03:30.14]I feel like our world's been infected
[03:39.40]And somehow you left me neglected
[03:48.76]We found our life's been changed
[03:57.33]Babe, you lost me
