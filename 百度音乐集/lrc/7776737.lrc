[00:02.07]
[00:17.81]I'm watching a spider
[00:18.89]spinning his web
[00:19.91]no other thoughts running through my head
[00:22.51]
[00:26.38]And out in the night
[00:27.37]just outta sight
[00:28.53]a beautiful blue and gold butterfly
[00:31.69]
[00:34.87]Well it's obvious to me
[00:39.29]This butterfly can't sing
[00:47.43]
[00:49.10]She's caught in a web
[00:53.61]Can't run away
[00:57.90]She’s trapped in her head
[01:02.15]She’s caught in a web
[01:07.01]
[01:31.46]Her beautiful wings
[01:32.41]Are all I see
[01:33.71]fluttering & stuttering
[01:35.36]to an end
[01:36.58]
[01:39.93]The Spider looks down
[01:41.05]slowly descends
[01:42.10]creeping and crawling
[01:43.39]to her bitter end
[01:45.81]
