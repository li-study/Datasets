[00:00.00]Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again
[00:01.98]From "The Phantom Of The Opera"
[00:02.98]By: Sarah Brightman
[03:37.34][03:36.57][01:56.46][01:27.20][01:00.90][00:33.15][00:03.98]
[00:04.98]You were once my one companion
[00:11.77]You were all that mattered
[00:18.26]You were once a friend and father
[00:25.36]Then my world was shattered
[02:22.14][00:34.25]Wishing you were somehow here again
[00:41.16]Wishing you were somehow near
[00:47.95]Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
[00:54.56]Somehow you would be here
[01:01.28]Wishing I could hear your voice again
[01:07.54]Knowing that I never would
[01:14.14]Dreaming of you won't help me to do
[01:20.53]All that you dreamed I could
[01:28.30]Passing bells and sculpted angels
[01:34.62]Cold and monumental
[01:40.65]Seem for you the wrong companions
[01:48.21]You were warm and gentle
[02:08.82]Too many years fighting back tears
[02:14.73]Why can't the past just die?
[02:29.76]Knowing we must say goodbye
[02:38.41]Try to forgive, teach me to live
[02:44.07]Give me the strength to try
[02:49.78]No more memories, no more silent tears
[02:57.93]No more gazing across the wasted years
[03:11.06]Help me say goodbye
[03:21.27]Help me say goodbye...
[03:38.07]~END~
