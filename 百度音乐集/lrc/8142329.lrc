[00:00.00]Florence And The Machine - Howl
[00:08.00]
[00:23.05]If you could only see the beast
[00:25.47]you've made of me
[00:26.81]I held it in but now it seems
[00:28.61]you've set it running free
[00:30.32]Screaming in the dark,
[00:31.91]I howl when we're apart
[00:33.84]Drag my teeth across your chest
[00:35.89]to tast your beating heart
[00:37.79]My fingers claw your skin,
[00:39.50]try to tempt my way in
[00:41.18]You are the moon that makes the night
[00:43.36]for which I have to howl
[00:45.22]My fingers claw your skin,
[00:46.72]try to tempt my way in
[00:48.90]You are the moon that breaks the night
[00:50.90]for which I have to
[00:52.57]Howl, howl
[00:59.76]Howl, howl
[01:07.47]Now there's no rolling back,
[01:09.28]I'm aching to attack
[01:10.96]My blood is singing with your voice,
[01:12.82]I want to pour it out
[01:14.81]The saints can't help me now,
[01:16.18]the ropes have been unbound
[01:18.72]I hunt for you with bloodied feet
[01:20.53]across the hallowed ground
[01:22.48]Like some child possessed,
[01:24.69]the beast howls in my veins
[01:28.77]I want to find you
[01:30.32]and tear out all of your tenderness
[01:36.45]And howl, howl
[01:44.23]Howl, howl
[01:51.18]Be careful of the curse
[01:54.16]that falls on young lovers
[01:58.82]Starts so soft and sweet
[02:02.08]and turns them into hunters
[02:06.80]Hunters, hunters, hunters
[02:12.55]Hunters, hunters, hunters
[02:17.69]Hunters, hunters
[02:21.55]The fabric of your flesh,
[02:22.88]pure as a wedding dress
[02:24.50]Until I wrap myself inside
[02:26.52]your arms I cannot rest
[02:28.64]The saints can't help me now,
[02:30.10]the ropes have been unbound
[02:32.18]I hunt for you with bloodied feet
[02:34.05]across the hallowed ground
[02:35.78]And howl
[02:43.34]And howl
[02:50.30]Be careful of the curse
[02:53.34]that falls on young lovers
[02:57.36]Starts so soft and sweet
[03:01.18]and turns them into hunters
[03:05.65]A man who's pure of heart
[03:09.14]and says his prayers by night
[03:12.12]May still become a wolf
[03:16.45]when the autumn moon is bright
[03:20.36]If you could only see the beast
[03:22.48]you've made of me
[03:24.12]I held it in but now it seems
[03:26.15]you've set it running free
[03:27.83]The saints can't help me now,
[03:29.35]the ropes have been unbound
[03:31.53]I hunt for you with bloodied feet
[03:33.40]across the hallowed ground
[03:35.98]
