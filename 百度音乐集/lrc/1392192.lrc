[00:16.50]
[00:17.47]This time, I wonder what it feels like
[00:24.11]To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
[00:30.67]But dreams just aren’t enough
[00:32.29]So I’ll be waiting for the real thing,
[00:36.90] I’ll know it by the feeling
[00:41.12]The moment when we’re meeting,
[00:45.37]will play out like a scene
[00:47.35]Straight off the silver screen
[00:48.97]So I’ll be holding my own breath, right up ’til the end
[00:53.45]Until that moment when,
[00:55.33] I find the one that I’ll spend forever with
[00:59.97]
[01:00.67]Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
[01:04.76]Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
[01:08.83]Someone to love with my life in their hands
[01:12.96]There’s gotta be somebody for me like that
[01:17.15]Cause nobody wants to do it all on their own
[01:21.24]And everyone wants to know they’re not alone
[01:25.41]There’s somebody else that feels the same somewhere
[01:29.49]There’s gotta be somebody for me out there
[01:33.80]
[01:33.82]Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
[01:40.83]And dammit this means too right,
[01:45.11] it’s just like deja vu
[01:47.01]Me standing here with you
[01:48.87]So I’ll be holding my own breath,
[01:51.40] could this be the end
[01:53.10]Is it that moment when,
[01:55.07] I find the one that I’ll spend forever with
[01:59.05]
[02:00.71]Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
[02:04.70]Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
[02:08.99]Someone to love with my life in their hands
[02:12.95]There’s gotta be somebody for me like that
[02:17.24]Cause nobody wants to do it all on their own
[02:21.30]And everyone wants to know they’re not alone
[02:25.46]There’s somebody else that feels the same somewhere
[02:29.58]There’s gotta be somebody for me out there
[02:33.82]
[02:50.18]You can’t give up, looking for a diamond in the rough
[02:58.80]The wind shows up, (make sure you’re holding on)
[03:03.11]Cause it could be the one, the one you’re waiting on
[03:06.88]Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
[03:10.87]And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
[03:15.31]Someone to love with my life in their hands
[03:19.19]There’s gotta be somebody for me, oh
[03:23.66]
[03:23.72]Nobody wants to do it all on their own
[03:27.48]And everyone wants to know they’re not alone
[03:31.68]There’s somebody else that feels the same somewhere
[03:35.81]There’s gotta be somebody for me out there
[03:40.13]Nobody wants to be the last one there
[03:44.19]Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
[03:48.20]There’s somebody else that feels the same somewhere
[03:52.22]There’s gotta be somebody for me out there
