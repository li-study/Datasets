[00:06.18]for my daring Jun
[00:15.80]When the night has come
[00:21.20]And the land is dark
[00:23.79]And the moon is the only light we'll see
[00:31.50]No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
[00:39.65]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[00:46.12]And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
[00:51.87]Stand by me, stand by me
[01:03.62]If the sky that we look upon
[01:09.06]Should tumble and fall
[01:11.80]And the mountains should crumble to the sea
[01:19.67]I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
[01:28.48]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[01:37.39]And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
[01:41.89]Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah
[02:39.53]Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
[02:44.87]Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
[02:54.04]Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
[02:57.32]Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
