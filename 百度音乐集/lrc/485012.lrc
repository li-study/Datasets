[00:07]Sometimes I feel so happy
[00:13]Sometimes I feel so sad
[00:19]Sometimes I feel so happy
[00:23]But mostly you just make me mad
[00:29]Baby you just make me mad
[00:36][01:30][02:27][04:17][05:12]Linger on, your pale blue eyes
[00:47][01:41][02:39][04:28][05:24]Linger on, your pale blue eyes
[01:01]Thought of you as my mountain top
[01:07]Thought of you as my peak
[01:13]Thought of you as everything
[01:18]I've had but could'nt keep
[01:24]I've had but could'nt keep
[01:56]If I could make the world as pure
[02:03]and strange as what I see
[02:08]I'd put you in the mirror
[02:14]I put in front of me
[02:19]I'd put in front of me
[03:47]Skip a life completely, stuff it in a cup
[03:59]She said money is like us in time
[04:04]It lies but can't stand up
[04:10]Down for you is up
[04:42]It was good what we did yesterday
[04:47]And I'd do it once again
[04:54]The fact that you are married
[04:58]Only proves that you're my best friend
[05:05]But it's truly, truly a sin
