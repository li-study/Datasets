[00:17.00]I see ya blowin' me a kiss
[00:19.00]It doesn't take a scientist
[00:21.00]To understand what's going on baby
[00:24.00]If you see something in my eye
[00:27.00]Let's not over analyze
[00:29.00]Don't go too deep with it baby
[00:33.00]So let it be what it'll be
[00:36.00]Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
[00:40.00]Here's what I'll do
[00:43.00]I'll play loose
[00:44.00]Run like we have a day with destiny
[00:49.00]It's just a little crush (crush)
[00:53.00]Not like I faint every time we touch
[00:58.00]It's just some little thing (crush)
[01:02.00]Not like everything I do depends on you
[01:07.00]Sha-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la
[01:15.00]It's raising my adrenaline
[01:18.00]You're banging on a harder tin
[01:19.00]Please don't make too much of it baby
[01:23.00]You say the word "forevermore"
[01:25.00]That's not what I'm looking for
[01:28.00]All I can commit to is "maybe"
[01:32.00]So let it be what it'll be
[01:34.00]Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
[01:40.00]Here's what I'll do
[01:42.00]I'll pay loose
[01:43.00]Run like we have a day with destiny
[01:49.00]It's just a little crush (crush)
[01:52.00]Not like I faint every time we touch
[01:57.00]It's just some little thing (crush)
[02:00.00]Not like everything I do depends on you
[02:06.00]Sha-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la
[02:13.00]Vanilla skies (vanilla skies)
[02:19.00]White picket fences in your eyes
[02:24.00]A vision of you and me
[02:30.00]It's just a little crush (crush)
[02:34.00]Not like I faint every time we touch
[02:39.00]It's just some little thing (crush)
[02:42.00]Not like everything I do depends on you
[02:47.00]Sha-la-la-la
[02:51.00]Not like I faint every time we touch
[02:55.00]It's just some little thing
[02:59.00]Not like everything I do depends on you
[03:04.00]Sha-la-la-la
[03:07.00]Not like I faint every time we touch
[03:12.00]It's just some little thing
[03:16.00]Not like everything I do
