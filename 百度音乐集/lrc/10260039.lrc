[00:55.52]Black is the colour of my true love's hair
[01:03.06]Her lips are like some roses fair
[01:10.24]She has the sweetest smile
[01:14.78]and the gentlest hands
[01:19.95]And i love the ground where on she stands
[01:33.45]I go to the Clyde where i mourn and weep
[01:41.60]For satisfied i never can be
[01:49.05]I write her a letter, just a few short lines
[01:56.27]and suffer death a thousand times
[02:03.42]
[02:13.23]Black is the colour of my true love's hair
[02:18.44]Her lips are like some roses fair
[02:26.06]She has the sweetest smile
[02:30.24]and the gentlest hands
[02:33.39]And i love the ground where on she stands
[02:40.61]
[02:50.85]I love my love and well she knows
[02:56.12]I love the ground where on she goes
[03:03.39]I wish the day it soon would come
[03:10.89]when she and i could be as one
