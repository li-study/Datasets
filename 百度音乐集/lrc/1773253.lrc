[01:47.24]I guess
[01:49.34]That this is where we’ve come to
[01:52.80]If you don’t want to
[01:53.04]Then you don’t have to
[01:53.24]Believe me
[01:53.43]But I
[01:53.63]Won’t be there when you go down
[01:53.80]Just so you know now
[01:54.00]You’re on your own now
[01:54.18]Believe me
[01:54.37]
[01:54.57]Yo
[01:54.77]I don’t wanna be the one to blame you
[01:54.98]Like fun and games
[01:55.19]Keep playin’ ‘em
[01:55.39]I’m just saying
[01:55.58]Think back then
[01:55.77]We was like one in the same
[01:55.99]On the right track
[01:56.19]But I was on the wrong train
[01:56.39]It’s like that
[01:56.58]Now you gotta face the pain
[01:56.80]And the devil’s got a fresh new place to play
[01:58.32]In your brain
[01:58.52]Like a maze
[01:58.70]You can never escape
[01:58.89]The rain
[01:59.07]Every damn day’s the same shade of grey
[01:59.25]Hey
[01:59.43]I used to have a little bit of a plan
[01:59.61]Use ta’
[01:59.80]Have a concept of where I stand
[01:59.99]But that concept slipped right outta my hand
[02:00.19]And now
[02:00.39]I don’t really even know who I am
[02:00.56]Yo
[02:00.75]What do I have to say
[02:00.93]Maybe I should do
[02:01.11]What I have to do to break free
[02:01.28]‘N whatever happens to you
[02:01.48]We’ll see
[02:01.66]But it’s not gonna happen with me
[02:01.83]
[02:04.25]I guess
[02:04.46]That this is where we’ve come to
[02:04.67]If you don’t want to
[02:04.86]Then you don’t have to
[02:05.05]Believe me
[02:05.26]But I
[02:05.46]Won’t be there when you go down
[02:05.68]Just so you know now
[02:05.88]You’re on your own now
[02:06.08]Believe me
[02:06.28]
[02:06.51]Back then
[02:06.71]I thought you were just like me
[02:06.93]Somebody who could see all the pain I see
[02:07.15]But you
[02:07.36]Proved to me unintentionally
[02:07.56]That you would self destruct eventually
[02:07.78]Now I’m thinkin’ like the mistake I made doesn’t hurt
[02:07.99]But it’s not gonna work
[02:08.20]‘Cause it’s really much worse
[02:08.40]Than I thought
[02:08.63]I wished you were something you were not
[02:08.83]And now this guilt is really all that I got
[02:09.04]You turn your back
[02:09.27]And walk away in shame
[02:09.48]All you got
[02:09.68]Is a memory ‘a pain
[02:09.90]Nothin’ makes sense
[02:10.11]You jus’ stare at the ground
[02:10.31]I hear your voice in my head
[02:10.52]When no one else is around
[02:10.74]So what do I have to say
[02:10.96]Maybe I should do
[02:11.18]What I have to do
[02:11.41]To break free
[02:11.61]Man
[02:11.82]‘N whatever happens to you
[02:12.03]We’ll see
[02:12.23]But it’s not gonna happen with me
[02:12.42]
[02:12.61]I guess
[02:12.81]That this is where we’ve come to
[02:13.95]If you don’t want to
[02:14.15]Then you don’t have to
[02:14.34]Believe me
[02:14.54]But I
[02:14.74]Won’t be there when you go down
[02:14.96]Just so you know now
[02:15.17]You’re on your own now
[02:15.39]Believe me
[03:02.42]
[03:03.32]I will do whatever I have to do
[03:04.70]You’re on your own now
[03:05.70]Believe me
[03:08.09]Whatever happens to you
[03:08.38]You’re on your own now
[03:08.60]Believe me
[03:08.81]What do I have to say
[03:09.03]You’re on your own now
[03:09.26]Believe me
[03:09.46]It’s not gonna happen to me
[03:09.68]You’re on your own now
[03:09.90]Believe me
[03:10.10]Yeah!
