[00:47.50]Song sung blue  Everybody knows one
[00:55.98]Song sung blue  Every garden grows one
[01:02.91]
[01:06.50]Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
[01:15.40]But when you take the blues and make a song
[01:19.04]You sing them out again
[01:23.68]Sing them out again
[01:25.96]
[01:28.44]Song sung blue  Weeping like a willow
[01:35.99]Song sung blue  Sleeping on my pillow
[01:45.34]
[01:47.22]Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
[01:56.26]And before you know, start to feeling good
[01:58.82]You simply got no choice
[02:19.99]
[02:22.26]Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
[02:31.68]But when you take the blues and make a song
[02:35.50]You sing them out again
[02:39.14]
[02:40.74]Song sung blue  Weeping like a willow
[02:48.22]Song sung blue  Sleeping on my pillow
[02:56.32]
[02:59.24]Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
[03:08.71]And before you know, start to feeling good
[03:11.56]You simply got no choice
[03:16.14]
