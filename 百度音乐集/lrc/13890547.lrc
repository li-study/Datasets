[00:00.22]Madonna
[00:00.52]
[00:01.87]Oh My God
[00:02.96]I'm Heartily Sorry for Having Offended Thee
[00:05.97]And I Detest All My Sins
[00:09.06]Because I Dread the Loss of Heaven
[00:11.44]And the Pain of Hell
[00:13.54]But Most of All Because I Love Thee
[00:15.69]And I want So Badly to be Good.
[00:18.86]
[00:39.53]It's so hypnotic
[00:42.26]The way he pulls on me
[00:44.09]It's like the force of gravity
[00:46.75]Right up under my feet
[00:47.61]It's so erotic
[00:49.45]This feeling can't be beat
[00:51.10]It's coursing through my whole body
[00:52.74]Feel the heat
[00:53.58]
[00:53.92]I got that burnin' hot desire
[00:57.55]And no one can put out my fire
[01:01.08]It's coming right down through the wire
[01:04.65]Here it comes
[01:05.94]When I hear them 808 drums
[01:08.55]It's got me singing
[01:09.39]
[01:09.67]Hey, ey, ey, ey
[01:12.91]Like a girl gone wild

[01:27.63]Get fired up like smokin' gun
[01:31.26]On the floor til the daylight comes
[01:34.93]Girls they just wanna have some fun

[01:45.70]The room is spinning
[01:47.57]It must be the tanqueray
[01:49.28]I'm about to go astray
[01:50.97]My inhibition's gone away
[01:52.74]I feel like sinning
[01:54.96]You got me in the zone
[01:56.74]DJ play my favorite song
[01:58.22]Turn me on
