[00:06.60]
[00:12.37]I gave you all you desired
[00:15.19]All that you needed
[00:16.70]Boy, I provided
[00:18.48]I let you into my head
[00:20.17]Into my bed
[00:22.18]And that’s a privilege
[00:24.00]I had your back at the answers
[00:26.67]You took the dollars
[00:28.07]I took the chances
[00:29.66]Defended, battled and fought
[00:32.04]Cuz I thought you really loved me
[00:35.43]I don’t know where to start or where to stop
[00:39.16]No, but I know I am done
[00:43.31]I’ve had enough
[00:45.48]So fall out of my hands
[00:48.29]Out of my heart
[00:50.15]And when you hit the ground
[00:52.15]You’ll be sorry that I’m not around
[00:54.69]I will watch you
[00:56.94]And you fall out of your mind
[00:59.37]Out of your fantasy
[01:00.94]When you hit the wall
[01:03.42]Think of me
[01:05.95]I’ll be on the top just watching you fall
[01:11.85]You said that you were the strong one
[01:14.47]I was the girl
[01:15.87]And I was the young one
[01:17.59]I kept your feet on the ground
[01:20.11]My head in the rounds I had you
[01:23.24]You told me you were so grateful
[01:25.70]I was with you
[01:27.21]And I was so faithful
[01:29.04]Stood by in all that you said
[01:31.35]And all that you did
[01:32.81]I loved you
[01:34.68]I don’t know how to act or what to say
[01:39.51]But I know I am good
[01:42.64]I’ll be okay
[01:44.39]And you fall out of my hands
[01:47.44]Out of my heart
[01:49.38]And when you hit the ground
[01:51.29]You’ll be sorry that I’m not around
[01:53.86]I will watch you
[01:55.63]And you fall out of your mind
[01:58.83]Out of your fantasy
[02:00.45]When you hit the wall
[02:01.78]Think of me
[02:05.14]I’ll be on the top just watching you fall
[02:10.94]I’ll be on the top just watching you fall
[02:18.85]So fall out of my hands
[02:21.35]Out of my heart
[02:23.15]And when you hit the ground
[02:25.52]You’ll be sorry that I’m not around
[02:27.81]I will watch you
[02:29.74]And you fall out of your mind
[02:32.67]Out of your fantasy
[02:34.40]When you hit the wall
[02:36.33]Think of me
[02:39.23]I’ll be on the top just watching you fall
[02:44.89]I’ll be on the top just watching you fall~
