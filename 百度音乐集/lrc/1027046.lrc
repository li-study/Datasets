[00:00.00]Mcfly - Ultraviolet
[00:03.03]Album: Wonderland
[00:06.11][00:10.62][03:22.96][03:53.92]
[00:12.02]Nothing goes to plan
[00:15.44]It's all a game of chance they say, in wonderland
[00:22.64]There's magic in the air
[00:26.20]A tragic love affair that I don't understand
[00:35.26][01:14.45][02:47.18][02:57.90]These summer girls are really something else
[00:42.37][01:21.56][02:54.23][03:04.92]Our lives are short
[00:44.14][01:23.22][02:55.97][03:06.62]The nights are long
[00:49.38]Mrs halloween
[00:52.80]Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans
[00:59.93]She throws another dart
[01:03.45]And narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart
[01:10.32]Torn apart
[01:19.88][02:52.53][03:03.23](It won't be long)
[01:26.33][01:29.78][01:33.37][02:05.61][02:09.05][02:12.63][03:09.69][03:13.16][03:16.74]The nights go on and on
[01:39.62]So pinch me I must be dreaming
[01:43.18]My life has lost all its meaning
[01:46.71]But I like the way I'm feeling now
[01:54.08]Kissing your lips at midnight
[01:57.68]Under the stars and moonlight
[02:01.04]But I never thought we'd be this wrong
[02:22.00]She's looking good tonight
[02:25.56]I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light
[02:32.88]Intoxicate my mind
[02:36.32]I know that love is blind
[02:38.03]And I'm not seeing right
[02:43.00]Not alright
