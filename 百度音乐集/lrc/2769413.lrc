[00:12.62]She Wants Revenge - Out Of Control
[00:16.99]With her high heel against the wall
[00:21.85]Kind of dancing though not at all
[00:26.68]She had stockings running up to her thighs
[00:30.93]Snaps her fingers to keep the time
[00:34.56]From the back of the room I saw her there
[00:39.15]I said she wants to be alone and I shouldnt dare
[00:43.96]But then she noticed me glance at her
[00:48.35]I had no choice but to dance with her
[00:52.51]The lights they glow sideways and up and down
[00:56.58]The beat takes you over and spins you round
[01:00.87]Our hearts steady-beating the sweat turns to cold
[01:05.19]Were slaves to the DJ and out of control
[01:16.75]I watched her feet move her hips they sway
[01:21.97]Does a hair flip then starts to say
[01:26.60]Oh, my God, its my favorite song
[01:30.52]I pull her close and she sings along
[01:35.23]We cant slow down even if we tried
[01:38.63]If the record keeps spinning so will I
[01:43.69]She likes disco and tastes like a tear
[01:45.88]Tells me dont stop dancing and shes pulling me near
[01:51.78]The lights they glow sideways and up and down
[01:56.27]The beat takes you over and spins you round
[02:00.60]Our hearts steady-beating the sweat turns to cold
[02:04.81]Were slaves to the DJ and out of control
[02:08.97]Weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
[02:13.18]Instead of dancing alone
[02:15.89]I should be dancing with you
[02:18.33]This song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
[02:22.33]Or maybe its only you
[02:24.48]but either way lets begin
[02:26.48]Weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
[02:31.02]Instead of dancing alone
[02:33.21]I should be dancing with you
[02:35.09]This song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
[02:39.33]Or maybe its only you
[02:41.35]but either way lets begin
[02:43.59]Weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
[02:47.97]Instead of dancing alone
[02:50.18]I should be dancing with you
[02:52.40]This song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
[02:56.59]Or maybe its only you
[02:58.20]but either way lets begin
[03:00.36]The lights they glow sideways and up and down
[03:04.19]The beat takes you over and spins you round
[03:08.31]Our hearts steady-beating the sweat turns to cold
[03:12.92]Were slaves to the DJ and out of control
[03:16.90]The lights they glow sideways and up and down
[03:21.24]The beat takes you over and spins you round
[03:25.48]Our hearts steady-beating the sweat turns to cold
[03:30.19]Were slaves to the DJ and out of control
[03:35.36]
