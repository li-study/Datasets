[00:04.13]the rolling stones
[00:04.81]
[00:15.14]You'd better grease up
[00:17.31]I'm coming back
[00:18.32]You're going to catch fire
[00:20.22]Pyromaniac
[00:21.35]You'd better shape up
[00:22.89]You'd better get set
[00:24.44]I'm gonna burn up
[00:25.82]In the smoke of a jet
[00:27.57]
[00:27.74]Sparks will fly
[00:28.80]When I finally get myself back on you, baby
[00:33.87]Sparks will fly
[00:35.02]When I finally get myself back to you baby
[00:41.12]You're going to find out
[00:43.49]Going to scream and shout
[00:46.66]We're going to pierce through this drought
[00:49.56]Sparks will fly, sparks will fly
[00:55.57]
[01:01.76]You'd better stand back
[01:03.95]The flames are high
[01:05.04]Better get help
[01:06.94]Can't stop the fire
[01:08.21]Bell's going to ring
[01:09.73]Hear the alarms
[01:11.20]Better tell the fire chief
[01:12.75]To quit playing cards
[01:14.18]
[01:14.36]Sparks will fly

[01:21.58]When I finally get myself back on you, baby
[01:26.77]I'm gonna step on the gas
[01:30.46]I want to get there really fast
[01:33.81]I want to fuck your sweet ass
[01:35.81]Sparks will fly
[01:41.94]Sharks will cry
[01:43.59]
[01:58.96]I had a good sniff around
[02:02.19]Along old hunting grounds
[02:05.09]But I have never found
[02:08.08]A woman so hot
[02:09.15]
[02:09.64]Sparks will fly
[02:10.62]When I finally get myself back on you, baby
[02:15.69]Sparks will fly
[02:16.76]When I finally get myself back to you, baby
[02:23.28]My fingers are crossed
[02:26.11]The time that we lost
[02:29.09]I'm in total chaos

[02:35.59]Sparks will fly
[02:41.73]Sparks will fly....
