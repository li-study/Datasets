[00:03.04]Adam Lambert
[00:04.91]
[00:11.00]Cold as ice
[00:12.83]And more bitter than a December
[00:17.05]Winter night
[00:18.60]That's how I treated you
[00:22.44]And I know that I
[00:24.43]I sometimes tend to lose my temper
[00:28.59]And I cross the line
[00:30.31]Yeah that's the truth
[00:32.85]
[00:34.29]I know it gets hard sometimes
[00:37.12]But I could never
[00:40.35]Leave your side
[00:42.86]No matter what I say
[00:44.90]
[00:45.58]Cause if I wanted to go
[00:47.59]I would have gone by now,
[00:49.78]But I really need you near me to
[00:53.18]Keep my mind off the edge
[00:57.11]If I wanted to leave
[00:59.41]I would have left by now,
[01:01.24]But you're the only one that knows me
[01:04.02]Better than I know myself
[01:07.76]
[01:11.06]All along
[01:14.10]I tried to pretend it didn't matter
[01:18.39]If I was alone
[01:19.71]But deep down I know
[01:22.40]If you were gone
[01:25.19]For even a day I wouldn't know
[01:29.26]which way to turn
[01:31.28]Cause I'm lost without you.
[01:34.42]
[01:35.80]I know it gets hard sometimes
[01:38.20]But I could never
[01:41.43]
[01:42.06]Leave your side
[01:44.02]No matter what I say
[01:45.93]
[01:46.97]Cause if I wanted to go
[01:48.68]I would have gone by now,
[01:50.80]But I really need you near me to
[01:54.19]Keep my mind off the edge
[01:57.33]If I wanted to leave
[02:00.28]I would have left by now,
[02:02.28]But you're the only one that knows me
[02:04.98]Better than I know myself
[02:08.78]
[02:13.90]I get kind of dark
[02:17.13]Let it go too far
[02:19.79]I can be obnoxious at times
[02:23.72]But try and see my heart
[02:25.62]Cause I need you need now
[02:27.89]So don't let me down
[02:30.99]You're the only thing in this world
[02:34.57]I would die without
[02:36.38]Cause if I wanted to go
[02:38.52]I would have gone by now
[02:40.26]But I really need you near me to
[02:43.40]Keep my mind off the edge
[02:47.68]If I wanted to leave
[02:49.92]I would have left by now
[02:51.77]But you're the only one that knows me
[02:54.49]Better than I know myself
[02:58.23]Cause if I wanted to go
[03:01.56]I would have gone by now
[03:03.21]But I really need you near me to
[03:06.79]Keep my mind off the edge
[03:10.39]If I wanted to leave
[03:13.37]I would have left by now
[03:14.93]But you're the only one that knows me
[03:17.73]Better than I know myself
[03:21.85]
