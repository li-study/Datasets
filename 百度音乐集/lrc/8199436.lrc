[00:21.96]wake up lonely with you by my side
[00:27.95]one more night it doesn't feel
[00:33.21]there are movies playing in your eyes
[00:39.14]you dream of our fortunes
[00:42.64]but you're wrong.
[00:48.95]i don't belong to you
[00:55.19]the moon is the only friend i have outside
[01:00.53]one more drink & i'll be healed
[01:05.67]i told you the words & then knew it was a lie
[01:11.06]i wish i could offer an appeal
[01:14.85]you're wrong
[01:20.62]i don't belong to you
[01:31.31]i don't belong to you
[01:45.87]
[02:11.74]what i'd give for that first night when you were mine
[02:13.73]tried with all that i have to keep you alive
[02:28.66]i wasn't taught this way with a thousand things to say
[02:38.36]i was born with a broken heart
[02:45.82]what i'd give for that first night you were mine
[03:03.68]so i'll put this cigarette to bed
[03:09.27]pull some sheets from off your side
[03:14.72]i put my arm around you safe in the night
[03:20.03]still dreaming of fortune
[03:23.90]but you're wrong
[03:29.73]i don't belong.
[03:34.29]you're wrong
[03:40.14]i don't belong.
[03:44.98]you're wrong
