[00:11.96]I guess this time you\'re really leaving
[00:18.73]I heard your suitcase say goodbye
[00:24.91]Well as my broken heart lies bleeding
[00:30.90]You say true love, it’s suicide
[00:37.02]You say you\'ve cried a thousand rivers
[00:43.17]And now you\'re swimming for the shore
[00:49.59]You left me drowning in my tears
[00:55.44]And you won\'t save me anymore
[01:00.72]I pray to God you\'ll give me one more chance
[01:04.71]I\'ll be there for you
[01:06.93]These five words I swear to you
[01:09.71]When you breathe I want to be the air for you
[01:13.10]I\'ll be there for you
[01:17.22]I\'d live and I\'d die for you
[01:19.68]Steal the sun from the sky for you
[01:22.35]Words can\'t say what a love can do
[01:25.47]I\'ll be there for you
[01:30.84]
[01:34.35]I know you know we\'re had some good times
[01:40.13]Now they have their own hiding place
[01:46.31]I can’t promise you tomorrow
[01:52.41]But I can\'t buy back yesterday
[01:58.68]And Baby you know my hands are dirty
[02:04.60]But I wanted to be your valentine
[02:11.18]I\'ll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
[02:17.11]When you get drunk, I\'ll be the wine
[02:26.12]I\'ll be there for you
[02:28.48]These five words I swear to you
[02:31.30]When you breathe I want to be the air for you
[02:34.68]I\'ll be there for you
[02:38.34]I\'d live and I\'d die for you
[02:41.30]Steal the sun from the sky for you
[02:43.95]Words can\'t say what a love can do
[02:46.91]I\'ll be there for you
[02:51.38]And I wasn\'t there when you were happy
[02:55.77]I wasn\'t there when you were down
[03:03.50]I didn\'t mean to miss your birthday
[03:08.44]I wish I\'d seen you blow those candles out
[03:20.75]
[03:40.19]I\'ll be there for you
[03:42.35]These five words I swear to you
[03:45.05]When you breathe I want to be the air for you
[03:48.49]I\'ll be there for you
[03:52.38]I\'d live and I\'d die for you
[03:54.65]Steal the sun from the sky for you
[03:57.66]Words can\'t say what a love can do
[04:00.78]I\'ll be there for you
