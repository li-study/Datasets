[00:23.06]Tell me
[00:24.59]What did you wear
[00:26.89]Innocence and red, well,
[00:30.38]I really don’t care
[00:32.68]How it’s all been easy
[00:35.98]And why you’re not lonely
[00:39.04]I didn’t need to know how
[00:42.00]He gets you loud
[00:44.40]I stumbled through the fire on my own
[00:50.86]Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
[00:56.66]Centuries spent together, back to back
[01:02.34]Someone give me more now
[01:05.41]I need this to last
[01:08.26]In the beat of the hour

[01:43.46]Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
[01:49.36]Centuries spent together, back to back
[01:55.27]Someone give me more now
[01:58.12]I need this to last
[02:48.45][02:02.06]...music...
[02:24.44]Somehow I’m failing in this war
[02:30.84]A little advice won’t help at all
[02:36.10]Yeah, now I’m failing in this war
[02:42.44]This little lie won’t mend my soul
[02:56.50]I stumbled through the fire all alone
[03:02.54]Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
[03:08.52]I have wasted centuries, always,
[03:14.26]But in my own sweet time, I’m
[03:20.22]I stumbled through the fire
[03:24.06]Sweet, sweet fire
[03:29.96]Sweet, sweet...
