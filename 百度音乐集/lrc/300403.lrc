[00:00.95]词曲：Billy Joel
[00:02.06]演唱：王若琳
[00:03.09]
[00:07.19]Some folks to get away
[00:09.73]Take a holiday from the neighborhood
[00:14.40]Hop a flight to Miami Beach
[00:16.87]Or to Hollywood
[00:21.00]But I'm talking Greyhound
[00:23.84]On the Hudson River Line
[00:28.70]I'm in a New York state of mind
[00:33.97]
[00:38.35]I've seen all the movie stars
[00:40.99]In their fancy cars and their limousines
[00:45.44]Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
[00:52.21]But I know what I'm needin'
[00:54.86]And I don't waste more time
[00:59.89]I'm in a New York state of mind
[01:04.77]
[01:09.80]It was so easy living day by day
[01:16.65]Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
[01:23.63]But now I need a little give and take
[01:29.65]The New York Times the Daily News
[01:36.79]
[01:41.31]It comes down to reality
[01:43.60]And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
[01:48.04]I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
[01:54.92]I don't have any reasons
[01:57.57]I've left them all behind
[02:02.45]I'm in a New York state of mind
[02:07.19]
[02:44.10]It comes down to reality
[02:46.94]And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
[02:51.58]I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
[02:58.30]I don't have any reasons
[03:01.05]I've left them all behind
[03:06.01]I'm in a New York state of mind
[03:13.01]
