[00:00.00]Elvis Costello - Monkey To Man
[00:11.53]A long time ago, our point of view
[00:18.56]Was broadcast by Mr. Bartholomew
[00:25.27]Now the world is full of sorrow and pain
[00:32.37]It's time for us to speak up again
[00:36.73]
[00:39.52]You're slack and sorry
[00:41.45]Such an arrogant brood
[00:46.58]The only purpose you serve is to bring us our food
[00:54.07]We sit here staring at your pomp and pout
[00:57.82]Outside the bars we use for keeping you out
[01:01.21]You've taken everything that you wanted
[01:05.06]Broke it up and plundered it and hunted
[01:08.45]Ever since we said it
[01:10.01]You went and took the credit
[01:11.97]It's been headed this way since the world began
[01:15.24]When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
[01:20.40]
[01:33.96]Every time that man struggles and fails
[01:40.81]He makes up some kind of fairytales
[01:47.86]After all of the misery that he has caused
[01:51.32]He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs
[01:54.82]
[01:55.15]Points up to heaven with cathedral spires
[01:58.68]All the time indulging in his base desires
[02:02.32]Ever since we said it
[02:03.84]He went and took the credit
[02:05.80]It's been headed this way since the world began
[02:09.14]When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
[02:14.39]
[02:31.56]Big and useless as he has become
[02:34.75]With his crying statues and his flying bomb
[02:38.41]Goes 'round acting like the chosen one
[02:41.93]Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin
[02:45.34]
[02:45.98]He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes
[02:52.79]Hoping to hell that someone's forgiven his crimes
[02:59.97]Fills the air with his pride and his praise
[03:03.39]He's big disgrace to our beastly ways
[03:06.73]
[03:07.10]In the fashionable nightclubs and finer precincts
[03:10.67]Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts
[03:14.52]Ever since we said it
[03:15.72]He went and took the credit
[03:17.76]It's been headed this way since the world began
[03:21.10]When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
[03:26.99]
