[00:00.00]Westlife - Desperado
[00:17.79]
[00:19.79]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[00:28.10]You been out ridin' fences for so long now
[00:36.23]Oh, you're a hard one
[00:39.13]But I know that you got your reasons
[00:44.26]These things that are pleasin' you
[00:48.76]Can hurt you somehow
[00:52.51]
[00:54.79]Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
[00:58.89]She'll beat you if she's able
[01:02.36]You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
[01:07.80]
[01:10.30]Now it seems to me, some fine things
[01:14.36]Have been laid upon your table
[01:18.27]But you only want the ones that you can't get
[01:24.93]Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
[01:34.11]Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
[01:42.80]And freedom, oh freedom well,
[01:46.59]that's just some people talkin'
[01:50.37]Your prison is walking through this world all alone
[01:57.40]
[02:00.59]Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
[02:04.84]The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
[02:08.75]It's hard to tell the night time from the day
[02:16.59]You're losin' all your highs and lows
[02:20.25]Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
[02:29.66]
[02:30.66]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[02:39.60]Come down from your fences, open the gate
[02:47.16]It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
[02:54.88]You better let somebody love you
[02:59.48](let somebody love you)
[03:02.66]You better let somebody love you
[03:08.38]before it's too late
[03:18.79]
