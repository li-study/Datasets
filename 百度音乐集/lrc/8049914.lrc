[01:19.11]When I was only seventeen
[01:21.96]I fell in love with a gypsy queen
[01:24.89]She told me to hold on
[01:33.35]Her father was the leadin' man
[01:36.04]He said you're not welcome on our land
[01:40.70]Then, as a foe, he told me to go
[01:47.60]Aaah...
[01:53.18]He took me to a little shack
[01:55.75]And put a whip across my back
[01:59.01]And told her leave me
[02:07.19]I was out for quite a time
[02:10.07]Came back with her on my mind
[02:14.34]That sweet little girl
[02:17.00]she means all the world
[02:21.37]Aaah...

[05:12.24]Ya know I want my gypsy queen
[05:15.09]Will she still be torn between
[05:17.94]Her father and lover
[05:26.51]One day I will go to him
[05:29.24]Strong enough to fight and win
[05:33.25]The kind of man
[05:35.53]That he'll understand
[05:40.25]Aaah...
[05:45.62]Aaah...
[05:48.67]
[05:53.96]Aaah...
[05:56.57]"Ending Solo..."
