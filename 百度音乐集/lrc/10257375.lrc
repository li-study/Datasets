[00:05.36]And i wake up in the morning with my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
[00:15.16]And i stumble to the breakfast table while the kids are going off to school, goodbye.
[00:24.29]And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it and says how you feeling hon?
[00:34.62]And i look across at smiling lips that warm my heart, and see my morning sun.
[00:41.98]
[00:44.10]And if that's not loving me, then all i've got to say,
[00:54.05]God didn't make the little green apples, and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summer time.
[01:04.86]And there's no such thing as dr. seuss or disney land and mother goose, no nursery rhymes.
[01:14.61]God didn't make the little green apples, and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summer time.
[01:24.55]And when myself is feeling low, i think about her face and go and ease my mind.
[01:32.60]
[01:34.95]Sometimes i call her up, at home, knowing she's busy.
[01:41.03]And ask her if she can get away, meet me and maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
[01:53.99]And she drops what she's doing and she hurries down to meet me, and i'm always late.
[02:04.38]But she sits waiting patiently, and smiles when she first sees me, because she's made that way.
[02:12.98]
[02:13.71]And if that ain't loving me, then all i've got to say,
[02:22.89]God didn't make the little green apples, and it don't snow in minneapolis when the winter comes.
[02:33.00]And there's no such thing as make-believe, puppy dogs or autumn leaves, no bb guns.
[02:42.62]God didn't make the little green apples, and it don't snow in minneapolis when the winter comes.
