[00:00.00]
[00:07.31]Jones Beach 1988. Come on!
[00:12.03]
[00:23.50]Do you remember,
[00:24.51]Or should I rewind,
[00:26.02]To that summer when you caught my eye,
[00:28.80]I played it cool,
[00:30.07]The weather was hot,
[00:31.53]You had the beauty and the beach on lock.
[00:34.39]
[00:34.87]With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt,
[00:38.13]Walkin' on the beach, so pretty,
[00:40.33]You wasn't lookin' for a man,
[00:42.20]When you saw me in the sand,
[00:43.56]But you fell for the boy from the city.
[00:45.83]
[00:46.29]I was like, "hey, girl, can I get your number"
[00:49.98]I remember what you told me too,
[00:52.83]"Don't call after ten"
[00:54.43]But you know that I did,
[00:55.85]'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you.
[00:58.20]
[00:58.47]I think about you in the summertime,
[01:00.82](Oh oh)
[01:01.44]And all the good times we had, baby,
[01:03.94]Been a few years and I can't deny,
[01:06.30](Oh oh)
[01:07.11]The thought of you still makes me crazy,
[01:09.54]I think about you in the summertime,
[01:12.08](Oh oh)
[01:12.77]I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
[01:16.18]You're my, my summertime.
[01:19.12]
[01:20.14]Do you remember,
[01:21.68]I'll never forget,
[01:23.03]Touchin' your body all soakin' wet,
[01:25.85]The water was cool,
[01:27.11]The feelin' was hot,
[01:28.73]Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.
[01:31.61]
[01:31.98]In your strapless sundress,
[01:33.68]Kickin' back, no stress,
[01:35.00]As long as we was together,
[01:37.47]'Cause we were feelin' young love,
[01:39.40]And we couldn't get enough.
[01:40.73]Baby, I could reminisce forever.
[01:43.06]
[01:43.29]And now I'm like,
[01:44.09]Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it,
[01:47.01]And I wonder if you miss it too,
[01:49.81]Never thought it would end 'til it did,
[01:52.28]Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you.
[01:55.19]
[01:55.44]I think about you in the summertime,
[01:57.85](Oh oh)
[01:58.47]And all the good times we had, baby,
[02:00.96]Been a few years and I can't deny,
[02:03.53](Oh oh)
[02:04.19]The thought of you still makes me crazy,
[02:06.72]I think about you in the summertime,
[02:09.35]I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
[02:13.37]You're my, my summertime.
[02:16.31]
[02:16.73]Break it down.
[02:17.88]
[02:18.37]Summer ended,
[02:19.45]Winter started,
[02:21.04]It got colder,
[02:22.53]When we parted ways,
[02:24.76](I like this part.)
[02:25.92]As the seasons change.
[02:27.96](Bring it forward, bring it back)
[02:29.59]Winter melted,
[02:30.90]Spring I felt it,
[02:32.36]Summertime will never be the same,
[02:35.88](Without you. My summertime.)
[02:38.81]My summertime.
[02:41.15]
[02:41.43]I think about you in the summertime,
[02:43.66]I think about you
[02:44.30]And all the good times we had, baby,
[02:45.76]We had baby
[02:46.81]It's been a few years and I can't deny,
[02:49.12]I can't deny
[02:49.90]The thought of you still makes me crazy,
[02:51.52]Makes me crazy
[02:52.39]I think about you in the summertime,
[02:55.79]I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
[02:59.11]On my mind,
[03:00.32]My summertime.
[03:02.23]
[03:02.68]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah.
[03:06.78]
