[02:02.81][00:02.07]Somebody Needs You
[02:00.76][00:08.10]
[00:20.66]I'm only human
[00:22.95]Sometimes I make mistakes
[00:30.19]If you forgive me
[00:32.47]I'm gonna do what it takes
[00:39.17]But now I know better
[00:41.53]To hurt you was wrong
[00:43.95]Girl it's with you I belong
[02:24.25][01:35.71][00:48.23]Somebody needs you
[02:26.68][01:38.50][00:50.99]Like never before
[02:28.93][01:40.49][00:53.09]Somebody wants your love
[02:31.36][01:42.96][00:55.42]Baby open the door
[02:34.45][01:45.31][00:57.81]Don't you leave me alone
[02:35.33][01:47.63][01:00.10]Don't you turn out the light
[02:37.53][01:50.01][01:02.45]Somebody wants you
[03:01.63][02:40.77][01:53.25][01:05.83]Somebody needs you tonight
[01:08.56]I've been thinking
[01:10.54]We should be talking it through
[01:17.59]You must believe me
[01:19.66]I'll make it up to you
[01:26.74]Cause now I know better
[01:29.07]To hurt you was wrong
[01:31.74]Girl it's with you I belong
[02:06.41]In the dark
[02:08.88]When there's no one else around
[02:13.59]I still pray
[02:15.91]That our love can be found
