[00:00.78]I really hope when you hear this song
[00:05.23]That you're happy someone new
[00:11.02]Cause I found a love I can call my own
[00:16.07]And I owe it in part to you
[00:44.18]Don't you know that you seem just a little craxy
[00:49.28]You had my trust and intemacy but you threw it away just threw it away
[00:54.72]And now it's all in the past when I think of you I just laugh
[00:59.58]My friends must thought I was high to have given so much to someone not worth my
[01:05.63]time
[01:07.48]Fun how sometimes you can really lose your mind and the things you
[01:10.32]would never do
[01:15.18]Did I do that
[01:16.67]You rhapsodize and get caught up in the height
[01:21.28]Till your senses return to you love plays you for a fool
[01:27.57]You were so insucure and your crew was so immature
[01:32.33]Conffersations painfuly weak
[01:34.90]You were much better off when you didn't speak
[01:37.88]But boy to tell you the truth
[01:40.20]It was my illusion of you
[01:42.93]Being somehow desting for me
[01:45.67]That had me in a daze but were not the same in time
[01:49.45]Fun how sometimes you can really lose your mind and the things you
[01:54.24]would never do
[02:00.59]Did I do that
[02:02.07]You rhapsodize and get caught up in the height
[02:04.97]Till your senses return to you love plays you for a fool
[02:11.67]I really hope when you hear this song
[02:15.82]That you know it was meant for you
[02:22.17]Though your attetion span's not that long
[02:26.41]Try to do the you can do
