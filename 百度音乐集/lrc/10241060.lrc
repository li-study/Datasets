[00:17.78]I love you whether or not you love me
[00:21.91]I love you even if you think that I don't.
[00:26.47]Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you but I don't mind.
[00:31.07]Why should I mind? Why should I mind?
[00:34.14]
[02:04.33][01:28.13][01:11.21][00:34.56]What is love anyway?
[02:08.76][01:33.01][01:15.73][00:39.37]Does anybody love anybody anyway?
[02:12.81][01:37.21][01:19.64][00:43.52]What is love anyway?
[02:17.50][01:42.94][01:24.26][00:48.07]Does anybody love anybody anyway?
[00:53.00]
[00:53.13]Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
[00:57.83]Never worry
[00:59.25]never be sad?
[01:02.14]The answer is they cannot love this much
[01:05.29]nobody can.
[01:06.27]This is why I don't mind you doubting.
[01:09.78][02:21.57]
[02:22.51]And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
[02:26.99]The door always must be left unlocked.
[02:31.57]To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
[02:36.00]And not to spend the time just doubting.
[02:39.77]
[02:40.20]What is love anyway? Does anybody love anybody anyway?
