[00:00.00]EVERY THING I SAID
[00:10.85]----The Cranberries
[00:13.88]BY D.V.
[00:20.21]It makes me lonely,
[00:24.02]It makes me very lonely
[00:28.13]When I see you here waitin' on
[00:39.92]He makes me tired
[00:43.51]he makes me very tired
[00:48.28]And inside of me
[00:52.34]lingers on
[00:57.73]But you have your heart
[01:02.77]Don't believe it
[01:07.79]and you will find it
[01:12.36]Waitin' on
[01:17.33]Everything I said, oh,
[01:23.01]well I meant it
[01:27.98]And inside my head
[01:31.92]holdin' on
[01:41.73]'Cos if I died tonight
[01:45.98]Would you hold my hand, no
[01:50.71]Would you understand
[02:01.02]And if I lived in spite
[02:05.15]Would you still be here, no
[02:09.85]Would you disappear
[02:19.12]Surely must be you
[02:23.85]Surely must be you
[02:28.80]But I don't make you lonely
[02:38.89]I'll get over you
[02:43.80]I'll get over you
[02:48.53]But I don't make you lonely
