[00:16.85]A devil in a midnight mass,
[00:19.45]He prayed behind stained glass
[00:22.22]A memory of Sunday class
[00:24.89]Resurrected from the past
[00:27.33]
[00:28.13]Hold your breath and count to four
[00:33.15]Pinky swears don't work no more
[00:38.51]Footsteps down the hallway floor
[00:41.20]Getting closer to my door
[00:43.89]I was alive but now I'm singing
[00:47.51]
[00:47.99]Silent night for the rest of my life
[00:50.46]Silent night for the rest of my life
[00:53.12]Silent night at the edge of your knife
[00:55.93](Forgive me father)
[00:57.06]Won't make it right
[00:58.62]Silent night for the rest of my life
[01:01.18]Silent night at the edge of your knife
[01:03.90](You're guilty!)

[01:15.05]A devil in a midnight mass
[01:17.21]Killed the boy inside the man
[01:20.16]The holy water in his hands
[01:22.53]Can never wash away his sins
[01:25.93]
[01:26.12]Hold your breath and count to four
[01:31.06]Pinky swears don't work no more
[01:36.65]Put my trust in God that day
[01:39.06]Not the man that got his way
[01:41.87]I was alive but now I'm singing
[01:45.30]
[01:45.86]Silent night for the rest of my life
[01:48.41]Silent night for the rest of my life
[01:51.13]Silent night at the edge of your knife
[01:53.86](Forgive me father!)
[01:54.84]Won't make it right
[01:56.57]Silent night for the rest of my life
[01:59.24]Silent night at the edge of your knife
[02:01.66](You're guilty!)
[02:08.47]
[02:18.71]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:21.08]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
[02:23.54]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:26.29]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
[02:29.36]
[02:29.66]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:31.56]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
[02:34.25]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:37.34]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
[02:39.67]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:42.45]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
[02:45.17]Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
[02:47.85]Your bed is made and it's in the ground
