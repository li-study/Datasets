[00:03.42]One summer night
[00:08.06]We ran away for a while
[00:14.87]Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
[00:20.08]To an obscure place to hide
[00:24.06]That no-one could find
[00:25.87]And we drifted to another state of mind
[00:31.87]And imagined I was yours and you were mine
[00:37.92]As we lay upon the grass
[00:40.24]There in the dark
[00:42.79]Underneath the stars
[00:45.41](Young love)
[00:49.93]Underneath the stars
[00:52.09](Young love)
[00:55.73]Oh baby
[00:58.50]Weak in the knees
[01:03.10]Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
[01:09.68]So shy, a bundle of butterflies
[01:14.82]Flush with heat of desire
[01:18.66]On a natural high
[01:20.53]As we drifted to another place in time
[01:26.79]And the feeling was so heady and sublime
[01:32.70]As I lost my heart to you
[01:34.89]There in the dark
[01:37.74]Underneath the stars
[01:39.99](Young love)
[01:47.25](Shum do do do)
[01:51.38]Beautiful and bittersweetly
[01:54.27]You were fading into me
[01:57.03]And I was gently fading into you
[02:04.07]But the time went sailing by
[02:06.35]Reluctantly we said goodbye
[02:09.65]And left our secret place so far behind
[02:15.49]And I lay in bed all night
[02:18.14]And I was drifting
[02:20.31]Drifting
[02:21.05]Drifting
[02:21.92]Drifting
[02:22.92]Drifting
[02:26.36]And I was yours
[02:29.42]And you were my own
[02:30.52]My own baby
[02:31.63]As we lay
[02:33.80]As we
[02:35.33]Lay underneath the stars
[02:37.58](Young love)
[02:44.12](Young love)
[02:38.14]Ohhhhh
[02:48.48]Underneath the stars
[02:50.20](Shum do do do)
[02:54.13]Underneath the stars
[02:56.60](Young love)
[03:00.08]Underneath the stars
[03:01.76](Young love)
