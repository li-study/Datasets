[00:02.00]Suzanne Vega - Gypsy
[00:07.00]
[00:18.09]You come from far away
[00:22.07]With pictures in your eyes
[00:25.29]Of coffeeshops and morning streets
[00:28.43]In the blue and silent sunrise
[00:31.96]But night is the cathedral
[00:34.85]Where we recognized the sign
[00:38.40]We strangers know each other now
[00:41.98]As part of the whole design
[03:24.28][02:36.86][01:33.21][00:45.41]Oh, hold me like a baby
[03:28.25][02:40.57][01:37.06][00:48.97]That will not fall asleep
[03:31.35][02:43.73][01:40.15][00:52.17]Curl me up inside you
[03:34.66][02:46.78][01:43.54][00:55.50]And let me hear you through the heat
[01:05.88]You're the jester of this courtyard
[01:09.13]With a smile like a girl's
[01:12.29]Distracted by the women
[01:15.78]With the dimples and the curls
[01:19.75]By the pretty and the mischievous
[01:22.57]By the timid and the blessed
[01:26.19]By the blowing skirts of ladies
[01:29.61]Who promise to gather you to their breast
[01:55.25]You have hands of raining water
[01:58.86]And that earring in your ear
[02:02.25]The wisdom on your face
[02:05.53]Denies the number of your years
[02:09.50]With the fingers of the potter
[02:12.41]And the laughing tale of the fool
[02:15.96]The arranger of disorder
[02:19.28]With your strange and simple rules
[02:23.10]Yes now I've met me another spinner
[02:26.66]Of strange and gauzy threads
[02:56.86][02:29.90]With a long and slender body
[02:33.45]And a bump upon the head
[03:00.47]And the sweetest softest hands
[03:04.09]And we'll blow away forever soon
[03:07.61]And go on to different lands
[03:11.15]And please do not ever look for me
[03:14.57]But with me you will stay
[03:17.73]And you will hear yourself in song
[03:21.37]Blowing by one day
