[00:04.31]
[00:11.54]I felt it first when I was younger
[00:17.02]A strange connection to the lie
[00:22.48]I tried to satisfy the hunger
[00:26.04]I never got it right
[00:28.77]I never got it right
[00:30.60]
[00:33.54]So I climbed a mountain and l built an altar
[00:39.04]Looked out as far as I could see
[00:44.54]And everyday I'm getting older
[00:48.17]I'm running outta dreams
[00:50.72]I'm running outta dreams
[00:54.02]
[00:54.87]But Your love
[00:56.37]Your love
[00:57.85]The only the thing that matters is Your love
[01:01.80]Your love is all I have to give
[01:06.00]Your love is enough to light up the darkness
[01:11.09]It's Your love
[01:12.98]Your love
[01:14.66]all I ever needed is Your love
[01:18.90]
[01:23.17]You know the effort I have given
[01:28.70]And you know exactly what it cost
[01:34.11]And though my innocence was taken
[01:37.76]Not everything is lost
[01:40.35]Not everything is lost
[01:43.45]
[01:44.56]But Your love
[01:46.06]Your love
[01:47.47]The only the thing that matters is Your love
[01:51.56]Your love is all I have to give

[02:00.63]It's Your love
[02:02.67]Your love
[02:04.32]all I ever needed is Your love
[02:09.06]
[02:12.99]You're the hope in the morning
[02:15.67]You're the light when the night is falling
[02:18.41]You're the song when my heart is singing
[02:20.93]it's Your love
[02:23.92]You're the eyes to the blind man
[02:26.61]You're the feet to the lame men walking
[02:29.44]You're the sound of the people singing
[02:31.92]It's Your love
[02:34.05]
[02:45.41]But Your love
[02:46.84]Your love
[02:48.42]The only the thing that matters is Your love

[03:08.17](Your love is all that I needed)
[03:10.57]all I ever needed is Your love
[03:14.36]Your love
[03:16.05]all I ever needed is Your love
