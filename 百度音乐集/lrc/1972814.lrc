[00:01.77]I've paid my dues
[00:05.61]Time after time
[00:09.52]I've done my sentence
[00:12.95]But committed no crime
[00:17.11]And bad mistakes
[00:21.02]I've made a few
[00:24.91]I've had my share of sand
[00:26.75]Kicked in my face
[00:28.52]But I've come through
[00:31.10]And I need to go on and on and on and on

[01:21.74]And my curtain calls
[01:26.06]You've bought me fame and fortune
[01:28.23]And everything that goes with it
[01:30.31]I thank you all
[01:32.93]But it's been no bed of roses no pleasure cruise
[01:40.69]I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
[01:44.70]And I ain't gonna lose
[01:47.14]And I need to go on and on and on and on
