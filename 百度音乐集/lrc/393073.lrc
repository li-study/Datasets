[00:09.30]love hurts
[00:11.61]singer:incubus
[00:25.04]Tonight we drink to youth
[00:31.01]And holding fast to truth
[00:32.40](Don't want to lose what I had as a boy)
[00:38.55]My heart still has a beat
[00:42.13](But love is now a feat
[00:49.06]Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
[00:52.61]Is there a spell that I am under
[00:56.53]Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
[01:01.93]Love hurts
[01:04.35]But sometimes it's a good hurt
[01:07.33]and it feels like I'm alive
[01:14.16]Love sings
[01:16.85]When it transcends the bad things
[01:19.62]Have a heart and try me
[01:23.29]'Cause without love I won't survive
[01:36.09]I'm fettered and abused
[01:37.14]I stand naked and accused
[01:40.01]Should I surface this one man submarine?
[01:41.25]I only want the truth
[01:48.52]So tonight we drink to youth
[01:52.43](I'll never lose what I had as a boy)
[01:55.95]Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
[01:59.49]Is there a spell that I am under
[02:02.63]Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
[02:09.64]Love hurts
[02:11.94]But sometimes it's a good hurt
[02:15.11]and it feels like I'm alive
[02:21.99]Love sings
[02:25.80]When it transcends the bad things
[02:30.41]Have a heart and try me
[02:33.90]'Cause without love I won't survive
[02:58.09]Love hurts
[03:00.91]But sometimes it's a good hurt
[03:04.41]and it feels like I'm alive
[03:10.47]Love sings
[03:14.53]When it transcends the bad things
[03:17.03]Have a heart and try me
[03:19.57]'Cause without love I won't survive
[03:24.61]Love hurts, love hurts
[03:31.90]Without love I won't survive
[03:37.63]Love hurts, love hurts
[03:44.12]Without love I won't survive
