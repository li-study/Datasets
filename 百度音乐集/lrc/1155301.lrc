[00:00.00]Sheryl Crow - Chances Are
[00:32.96]
[00:34.96]I was lost inside a daydream
[00:42.22]Swimming through the saline
[00:49.41]I looked at you and you breathed in
[00:56.59]Well, that's the way it's always been
[01:00.28]
[01:03.63]It all comes down to creating time
[01:10.03]You don't always have to make it right
[01:17.83]We'll all drive by in our hybrid lives
[01:25.69]Chances are we'll make it back
[01:34.23]
[01:46.54]I was doing time in the LA jail
[01:53.86]My Karma was living inside a failure
[02:00.97]No matter how it don't matter now
[02:08.28]Rest assured the rest is blurred
[02:12.16]
[02:15.27]It all comes down to doing time
[02:21.66]We don't always have to make it a crime
[02:29.29]We'll all drive off in our hybrid lives
[02:37.80]Chances are we'll make it back
[02:47.51]We'll make it back... We'll make it back
[03:00.46]
[03:20.08]Terror runs for king I said
[03:26.67]It is better to explore within
[03:33.83]We were apes before we spoke of sin
[03:41.08]The cosmos sits on the tip of a pin
[03:47.00]
[03:57.40]It all comes down to creating time
[04:03.61]You don't always have to make it alright
[04:11.27]We'll all drive by with our hybrid lives
[04:19.86]Chances are... Chances are... Chances are
[04:29.21]We'll make it back... We'll make it back
[04:43.58]We'll make it back... We'll make it back
[04:58.15]
