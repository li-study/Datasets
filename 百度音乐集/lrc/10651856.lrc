[00:08.16]
[00:12.16]I can't believe that you came into my life
[00:15.26]Now I'm all in
[00:16.90]Never thought you would make me the one
[00:20.63]Made a difference in my life
[00:22.59]Now I'm falling for you...
[00:24.73]
[00:25.73]And the walls keep crumbling down
[00:28.52]They're crumbling now
[00:29.61]Then you come around
[00:31.37]And my legs keep stumbling now
[00:34.59]I'll fall to the ground
[00:36.32]And taking me down...
[00:37.29]
[00:38.29]When I think I got it figured out
[00:41.06]You come around
[00:42.91]And then my walls start tumbling down (down)
[00:51.89]But you came then you saw then you conquered
[00:54.83]I had to fall
[00:56.29]Now my walls keep tumbling down (down)...
[01:03.27]
[01:04.27]How could it be
[01:06.60]You became to be a part of me
[01:09.37]Takin' over my every dream oh
[01:12.25]Here, it's not a game or fantasy
[01:15.19]Living inside your reality (reality)
[01:18.31]The way you touch
[01:20.69]The way you kiss
[01:22.34]There's more to your love than I ever wish
[01:25.65]Cupid shot me out the sky
[01:29.67]And now I'm falling...
[01:30.47]
[01:30.97]And the walls keep crumbling down
[01:33.88]They're crumbling now
[01:35.34]Then you come around
[01:37.18]And my legs keep stumbling now
[01:40.24]I'll fall to the ground
[01:42.05]And taking me down...

[02:18.63]Falling
[02:22.47]Now
[02:24.51]I'm falling, falling
[02:27.18]I'm falling for you
[02:29.00]You're taking me down
[02:31.56]And I can't see the bottom
[02:34.31]There ain't nothing stopping me now...
[02:36.49]
[02:37.49]And when I think I got it figured out
[02:40.43]You come around
[02:42.13]And then my walls start tumbling down (down)
