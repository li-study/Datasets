[00:03.95]
[00:17.41]I don't wanna be adored
[00:24.15]Don't wanna be first in line
[00:28.52]Or make myself heard
[00:33.23]I'd like to bring a little light
[00:40.16]To shine a light on your life
[00:44.27]To make you feel loved
[00:47.54]
[00:49.06]No, don't wanna be the only one you know
[00:59.69]I wanna be the place you call home
[01:04.91]
[01:05.31]I lay myself down
[01:11.92]To make it so, but you don't want to know
[01:19.57]I give much more
[01:23.95]Than I'd ever ask for
[01:29.31]
[01:37.17]Will you see me in the end
[01:43.72]Or is it just a waste of time
[01:47.88]Trying to be your friend
[01:52.54]Just shine, shine, shine
[01:56.27]Shine a little light
[01:59.13]Shine a light on my life
[02:03.08]Warm me up again
[02:06.17]
[02:07.61]Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
[02:17.50]You know that it could be so simple
[02:21.97]
[02:22.52]I lay myself down
[02:29.57]To make it so, but you don't want to know
[02:37.21]You take much more
[02:41.12]Than I'd ever ask for
[02:46.65]
[03:33.61]Say a word or two to brighten my day
[03:43.21]Do you think that you could see your way
[03:47.63]
[03:48.19]To lay yourself down
[03:55.14]And make it so, but you don't want to know
[04:02.44]You take much more
[04:06.50]Than I'd ever ask for
[04:15.94]
