[00:33.52]Its been a while since the last time that weve seen each other
[00:37.47]Got me thinking bout that time when we were together
[00:41.59]You used to make me laugh, with a silly act
[00:47.69]With your funny voice and that small koala nose of yours
[00:51.14]I guess good things werent meant to last
[00:55.25]Because you were by my side
[00:56.62]But now its just all in the past
[00:59.09]All the things that stood between us
[00:59.07]Was more than just love and trust
[01:01.03]I guess youd agree were better off how we are now
[01:05.22]But when you tell me all the terrible things
[01:08.43]That are happening in your life
[01:13.52]Something feels weird and its hurting me deep inside
[01:17.36]And it cuts me like a knife
[01:19.36]
[01:21.89]You dont deserve all the things youre going through
[01:29.37]And the more you cry, the more Im dying deep down inside
[01:37.20]Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
[01:45.23]Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
[01:52.32]I guess good things werent meant to last
[01:56.19]Because you were by my side
[01:57.84]But now its just all in the past
[02:00.23]All the things that stood between us
[02:02.23]Was more than just love and trust
[02:04.15]I guess youd agree were better off how we are now
[02:08.34]But when you tell me all the terrible things
[02:11.55]That are happening in your life
[02:15.70]Something feels weird and its hurting me deep inside
[02:19.54]And it cuts me like a knife
[02:21.54]
[02:23.89]You dont deserve all the things youre going through
[02:31.53]And the more you cry, the more Im dying deep down inside
[02:39.36]Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
[02:47.43]Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
[02:55.34]Can you hear my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat beating for you
[03:03.02]Can you hear my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat beating for you
[03:14.02]
[03:16.20]You dont deserve all the things youre going through
[03:23.84]And the more you cry, the more Im dying deep down inside
[03:31.71]Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
