[00:07.00]Music / Rudolf Schenker.  Lyrics / Klaus Meine.  Vocal / Rudolf Schenker.
[00:14.00]
[00:22.00]Time, it needs time
[00:26.00]To win back your love again
[00:30.00]I will be there, I will be there
[00:41.00]Love, only love
[00:45.00]Can bring back your love someday
[00:49.00]I will be there, I will be there
[01:22.00]I'll fight, babe, I'll fight
[01:27.00]To win back your love again
[01:31.00]I will be there, I will be there
[01:41.00]Love, only love
[01:46.00]Can break down the wall someday
[01:49.00]I will be there, I will be there
[02:01.00]If we'd go again
[02:04.00]All the way from the start
[02:10.00]I would try to change
[02:13.00]The things that killed our love
[02:19.00]Your pride has built a wall, so strong
[02:23.00]That I can't get through
[02:26.00]Is there really no chance
[02:31.00]To start once again
[02:34.00]I'm loving you
[02:58.00]Try, baby try
[03:03.00]To trust in my love again
[03:06.00]I will be there, I will be there
[03:17.00]Love, our love
[03:21.00]Just shouldn't be thrown away
[03:25.00]I will be there, I will be there
[03:36.00]If we'd go again
[03:39.00]All the way from the start
[03:45.00]I would try to change
[03:48.00]The things that killed our love
[03:54.00]Your pride has built a wall, so strong
[03:58.00]That I can't get through
[04:02.00]Is there really no chance
[04:06.00]To start once again
[04:11.00]If we'd go again
[04:15.00]All the way from the start
[04:20.00]I would try to change
[04:24.00]The things that killed our love
[04:29.00]Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know
[04:33.00]What you've been through
[04:36.00]You should give me a chance
[04:40.00]This can't be the end
[05:35.00][04:44.00]I'm still loving you
[04:52.00]I'm still loving you
[05:49.00][05:41.00][05:08.00]I need your love
[06:00.00][05:43.00][05:10.00][05:01.00]I'm still loving you
[06:04.00]
[06:11.00]BEYOND再见理想
