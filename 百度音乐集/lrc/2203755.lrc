[00:05.65]Paula DeAnda
[00:10.58]
[00:28.47]You don't even hold me like you used to hold me
[00:35.66]And that's the way you could've made all the things you told me
[00:40.50]Yeah, yeah
[00:42.65]I remember when you told me you'd never lie to me
[00:46.15]I can't believe I trusted you
[00:49.22]I sacrificed my time and my heart
[00:52.37]I gave you my all and what you do
[00:55.71]You stepped on me, you walked on me
[00:59.49]Boy you left your
[01:01.79]Footprints on my
[01:02.74]Heart broken crying over the way you left your
[01:08.15]Footprints on my
[01:09.73]Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
[01:15.23]Footprints on my heart
[01:20.29]My heart
[01:22.02]
[01:24.41]I know the way you were berfore me
[01:27.04]And I was crazy to think you'd change
[01:31.31]I put up with your attitude
[01:34.04]Your selfish ways and your childish games (whoa)
[01:38.34]A good heart always ends up broken
[01:40.64]But overtime, it'll make me strong
[01:45.30]I'ma put the pieces back together
[01:47.57]Might take some time, but I just go on
[01:51.45]You stepped on me, you walked on me
[01:55.26]Boy you left your
[01:57.24]Footprints on my
[01:58.24]Heart broken crying over the way you left your
[02:03.22]Footprints on my
[02:05.34]Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
[02:10.86]Footprints on my heart
[02:15.99]My heart
[02:17.77]
[02:19.37]Love me or leave me
[02:22.45]I don't mind
[02:23.73]My heart can't take this pain
[02:26.82]We had something so beautiful
[02:31.37]But now it's not the same
[02:33.84]So I gotta let this go
[02:35.63]Gotta take back the truth
[02:37.38]This situation makes no good for me
[02:41.35]I can't believe I let it happen like this
[02:44.56]I just sat back while you
[02:47.06]You stepped on me, you walked on me
[02:50.70]Boy you left your
[02:52.97]Footprints on my
[02:54.56]Heart broken crying over the way you left your
[02:59.47]Footprints on my
[03:01.00]Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
[03:06.61]Footprints on my heart
[03:11.51]My heart
[03:16.18]Ooh, whoa, ooh
[03:24.52]Yeah, yeah...yeah, yeah...
[03:37.83]Ooh
