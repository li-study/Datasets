[00:03.00]
[00:03.83]You....
[00:07.26]are my reason to live,
[00:13.46]all I own I would give,
[00:19.50]just to have you adore me.
[00:26.21]
[00:27.19]Till....
[00:31.06]The moon deserts the sky,
[00:36.84]Till all the seas run dry,
[00:42.55]Till then I'll worship you.
[00:49.36]
[00:50.43]Till....
[00:54.14]The tropic sun grows cold,
[00:59.91]Till this young world grows old,
[01:05.67]my darling, I'll adore you.
[01:12.37]
[01:13.60]You....
[01:17.23]are my reason to live,
[01:23.02]all I own I would give,
[01:29.10]just to have you adore me.
[01:35.20]
[01:37.02]Till....
[01:41.18]The rivers flow upstream,
[01:46.70]Till lovers cease to dream,
[01:52.39]Till then I'm yours,
[01:56.26]be mine.
