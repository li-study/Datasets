[00:-0.50]Only Love

[00:08.26]can make a memory
[00:13.19]Only love can make a moment last
[00:14.87]You were there and all the world was young
[00:21.84]And all it's songs unsung and I remember you
[00:29.67]then when love was all all you were living for
[00:37.93]Only then I felt my heart was free
[00:42.47]I count the headlights passing by
[00:49.33]With every one I find
[00:52.02]another reason why
[00:57.28]You'll be sound asleep
[01:00.67]And I'll look like a fool
[01:05.71]How could I be so cruel?
[01:08.51]Only love could make me turn around
[01:14.19]and make these tears come tumbling down
[01:18.60]Only love
[01:22.00]Only love could make you stay with me
[01:27.79]I doubt myself but you believe
[01:32.45]Only love
[01:37.49]I wish that I could be that strong
[01:44.16]To see me as I am,
[01:46.66]and love me right or wrong
[01:51.92]I guess I'm still afraid
[01:55.44]to only say goodbye
[02:00.12]So I keep it all inside
[02:03.28]Only love could make me turn around
[02:08.98]and make these tears come tumbling down
[02:13.56]Only love
[02:16.91]Only love could make you stay with me
[02:22.70]I doubt myself but you believe
[02:27.23]Only love
[02:30.71]Only love...
[02:36.30]
[02:49.70]So I try to run, but no matter what I do
[02:55.50]I know it's true: I can't go on without you
[03:15.34]Only love could make you stay with me
[03:21.18]I doubt myself but you believe
[03:25.53]Only love
[03:29.08]Only love could make me turn around
[03:34.71]and make these tears come tumbling down
[03:39.27]Only love
[03:42.65]Only love could make you stay with me
[03:48.44]I doubt myself but you believe
[03:52.79]Only love
[03:56.63]Only love could make me turn around...
