[00:22.19]Someday
[00:24.83]When my life has passed me by
[00:29.17]I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
[00:39.51]One way
[00:42.15]In the eyes of a passerby
[00:46.48]I'll look around for another try
[00:50.73]And'll fade away
[00:55.40](Chorus)
[00:57.26]Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
[01:01.59]This place is war without a care
[01:05.99]We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
[01:10.25]I go to leave as you reach for me
[01:14.25]Some say
[01:16.90]Better things will come our way
[01:21.06]No matter what they try to say you were always there for me
[01:31.53]Someway
[01:34.23]When the sun begins to shine
[01:37.33]
[01:38.31]I hear a song from another time
[01:42.87]And'll fade away
[01:47.20]And'll fade away
[01:54.13]Chorus
[01:54.45]Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
[01:54.66]This place is war without a care
[02:02.28]We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
[02:06.56]I go to leave as you reach for me
[02:23.04]
[02:40.11]So far, so long, so far away
[02:48.74]So far, so long, so far away (away, away)
[02:57.39]Someday
[02:58.73]When my life has passed me by
[03:03.07]I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
[03:13.19]One way
[03:15.99]In the eyes of a passerby
[03:20.23]I'll look around for another try
[03:24.99]And'll fade away
[03:29.43]And'll fade away
[03:33.23]And'll fade away
[03:37.55]And'll fade away
[03:41.81]And'll fade away
[03:46.19]And'll fade away
[03:50.43](someday)
[03:51.04]And'll fade away
