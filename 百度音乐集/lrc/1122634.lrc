[00:17.59]Don't cling so hard to your possessions
[00:22.03]For you have nothing, if you have no rights
[00:26.34]Let racist ignorance be ended
[00:30.67]For respect makes the empires fall

[01:19.63]Let no one build walls to divide us
[01:23.63]Walls of hatred nor walls of stone
[01:27.98]Come greet the dawn and stand beside us
[01:32.51]We'll live together or we'll die alone
[01:36.91]In our world poisoned by exploitation
[01:41.33]Those who have taken, now they must give
[01:45.66]And end the vanity of nations
[01:49.82]We've one but one Earth on which to live

[02:30.17]And so begins the final drama
[02:34.44]In the streets and in the fields
[02:38.84]We stand unbowed before their armour
[02:43.58]We defy their guns and shields
[02:47.59]When we fight, provoked by their aggression
[02:51.78]Let us be inspired by life and love
[02:56.29]For though they offer us concessions
[03:00.67]Change will not come from above.
[03:04.60]
