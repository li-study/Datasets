[00:05.89]
[00:12.31]In the heat of the fight I walked away
[00:19.02]Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay
[00:23.96]I said this time I’ve had enough
[00:30.60]And you’ve called a hundred times but I’m not picking up
[00:36.44]
[00:37.19]Cause I’m so mad I might tell you that it’s over
[00:43.41]But if you look a little closer
[00:47.42]
[00:48.09]I said leave but all I really want is you
[00:53.72]To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
[00:57.83]Screaming I’m in love with you
[01:00.08]Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
[01:05.67]And don’t you leave cause I know
[01:08.15]All I need is on the other side of the door
[01:14.19]
[01:22.71]Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
[01:29.56]Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
[01:34.12]I keep going back over things we both said
[01:40.50]And I remember the slamming door
[01:43.60]And all the things that I misread
[01:46.65]
[01:47.13]So baby, if you know everything
[01:49.45]Tell me why you couldn’t see
[01:52.94]When I left I wanted you to chase after me
[01:57.78]
[01:58.76]I said leave but all I really want is you
[02:03.82]To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
[02:08.67]Screaming I’m in love with you
[02:10.17]Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
[02:15.99]And don’t you leave cause I know
[02:18.45]All I need is on the other side of the door
[02:24.55]
[02:33.40]And I’ll scream out the window
[02:36.62]I can’t even look at you
[02:40.15]I don’t need you
[02:41.56]But I do, I do, I do
[02:45.96]I’ll say there’s nothing you can say
[02:48.91]To make this right again
[02:50.97]I mean it, I mean it
[02:56.30]What I mean is
[03:02.06]
[03:02.96]I said leave, but baby all I want is you
[03:08.45]To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
[03:12.99]Screaming I’m in love with you
[03:15.72]Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
[03:20.31]And don’t you leave cause I know
[03:22.68]All I need is on the other side of the door
[03:26.25]
[03:26.75]With your face and the beautiful eyes
[03:29.19]And the conversation with the little white lies
[03:31.94]And the faded picture of a beautiful night
[03:35.00]You carried me from your car up the stairs
[03:37.78]And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
[03:40.54]After everything and that little black dress
[03:43.58]After everything I must confess
[03:46.42]I need you
[03:53.08]
