[00:30.80]That I've been tryna wait for you to see me here.
[00:36.80]It's crazy cause no girl has made me wait like this.
[00:42.37]I'm used to having whatever a guy could wish.
[00:48.13]I see you wasting time making me feel like I want to want you so bad.
[00:56.20]I'm 'bout to lose my mind (Yeah)

[01:07.68]The game's gonna end and my team's not gonna win.
[01:10.19]

[02:02.60]But it's real, I see a future with you (Ooh whoa)
