[00:17.40]This ain\'t a song for the broken-hearted
[00:25.68]No silent prayer for the faith-departed
[00:33.99]I ain\'t gonna be just a face in the crowd
[00:37.55]You\'re gonna hear my voice
[00:40.25]When I shout it out loud
[00:45.59]It\'s my life
[00:48.21]It\'s now or never
[00:51.63]I ain\'t gonna live forever
[00:55.79]I just want to live while I\'m alive
[01:02.29](It\'s my life)
[01:04.13]My heart is like an open highway
[01:08.84]Like Frankie said
[01:10.98]I did it my way
[01:12.50]I just wanna live while I\'m alive
[01:17.79]It\'s my life
[01:25.84]
[01:28.61]This is for the ones who stood their ground
[01:36.27]It\'s for Tommy and Gina who never backed down
[01:44.79]Tomorrow\'s getting harder make no mistake
[01:48.93]Luck ain\'t even lucky
[01:51.37]Got to make your own breaks
[01:56.54]It\'s my life
[01:58.97]And it\'s now or never
[02:02.52]I ain\'t gonna live forever
[02:06.73]I just want to live while I\'m alive
[02:12.97](It\'s my life)
[02:14.85]My heart is like an open highway
[02:19.03]Like Frankie said
[02:20.19]I did it my way
[02:23.44]I just want to live while I\'m alive
[02:28.70](It\'s my life)
[02:39.22]Better stand tall when they\'re calling you out
[02:43.08]Don\'t bend, don\'t break, baby, don\'t back down
[02:50.89]It\'s my life
[02:53.54]For it\'s now or never
[02:56.87]I ain\'t gonna live forever
[03:01.01]I just want to live while I\'m alive
[03:07.27](It\'s my life)
[03:09.84]My heart is like an open highway
[03:13.46]Like Frankie said
[03:14.83]I did it my way
[03:17.65]I just want to live while I\'m alive
[03:22.98]It\'s my life
[03:30.00]
[03:36.94]灰色不寂寞
