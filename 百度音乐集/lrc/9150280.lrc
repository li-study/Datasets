[00:02.00]Capital Lights - Outrage
[00:09.00]
[00:23.64]I'll take the blame for you for taking one
[00:27.46]chance away from me at getting over this
[00:30.50]And what you were to me, your work is done,
[00:33.22]I'm laughing, after all we're getting too old for this and
[00:37.06]What a pretty night, what a pretty night,
[00:38.90]You finally fit into my shoes,
[00:40.50]I'm never dressed for the occasional
[00:42.28]Invasion of surprises, I don't get surprised
[00:44.71]You think your secret's safe with you,
[00:46.58]I'll catch it swinging through the grapevine
[00:48.22]It's time I let you go,
[00:52.05]And here's looking at you kid
[00:54.09]Your last word comes out slower than you thought it would
[00:58.45]Its all you ever wanted but
[00:59.96]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[01:02.70]You're gonna find out
[01:03.99]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[01:05.80]Gung ho you let your guard down,
[01:07.74]you're nothing but a write-out,
[01:09.36]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[01:12.80]
[01:13.82]I'm taking shame with you for taking 2,
[01:16.60]too many years that could have lasted now we'll never get back
[01:20.16]But tonight the moon will set the mood,
[01:22.40]I'm a train routed off course just to keep on track and
[01:25.80]What a petty crime, what a petty crime,
[01:28.67]How could you be anything but greedy when its all that you know
[01:31.51]Give another try, give another try,
[01:34.40]But if you're one for the money than you're too good to show on time
[01:38.09]I let you down,
[01:41.64]And here's looking at you kid
[01:43.43]Now that I found and caught you red- handed I'm the last man standing 'cuz
[01:49.49]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[01:51.55]You're gonna find out
[01:53.35]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[01:55.30]Gung ho, you let your guard down,
[01:57.65]you're nothing but a write-out,
[01:59.17]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[02:01.04]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[02:03.55]You're gonna find out
[02:04.94]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[02:07.12]Gung ho, you let your guard down,
[02:09.34]you're nothing but a write-out,
[02:10.74]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[02:14.44]
[02:15.41]Take my goodbyes with love and meaningful lyrics
[02:21.70]I got you this time, I got you this time
[02:26.61]A closing line unannounced and breaking your spirits
[02:32.71]A curtain call cry, I got you this time, I got you this time
[02:39.00]It's happened all before with you the one to call it short
[02:41.16]but girl when I say that it's over than its over for good
[02:44.23]We're nothing now but history,
[02:46.02]I'll leave you reminiscing in a diary regretting paying dues
[02:50.51]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[02:52.93]You're gonna find out
[02:54.37]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[02:56.60]Gung ho, you let your guard down,
[02:58.60]you're nothing but a write-out,
[02:59.96]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[03:02.34]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,

[03:10.36]you're nothing but a write-out,
[03:11.79]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[03:14.36]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[03:15.97]soon your gonna find that I'll take you out,
[03:18.70]This is an Outrage!
[03:19.78]You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
[03:22.01]You're gonna find out
[03:23.24]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
[03:29.00]I'll leave you raining on your own parade
