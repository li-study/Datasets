[00:02.07]Natasha Bedingfield
[00:04.41]Freckles
[00:12.21]I used to care so much about what others think about
[00:19.99]Almost didn’t have a thought of my own
[00:23.49]The slightest remark would make me embark
[00:28.20]On the journey of self doubt
[00:31.58]But that was a while ago
[00:34.61]This girl has got stronger
[00:37.14]If I knew then what I know now
[00:39.28]I would have told myself don’t worry any longer it's okay
[00:44.62]Cuz a face without freckles is like a sky without stars
[00:51.66]Why waste a second not loving who you are
[00:56.47]Those little imperfections make you
[01:00.15]beautiful, lovable, valuable,
[01:04.34]They show your personality inside your heart
[01:10.22]Reflecting who you are
[01:12.49]Who you are Who you are Who you are
[01:17.65]whoa
[01:22.89]I wondered if I could
[01:27.43]trade my body with somebody else in magazines
[01:32.24]With the whole world full at my feet
[01:35.73]I phantom worthy and would blame my
[01:39.24]failures on the ugliness I could see
[01:43.51]When the mirror looked at me
[01:46.12]Sometimes I feel like the little girl who
[01:50.80]doesn’t belong in her own world
[01:52.84]But I'm getting better
[01:55.17]And I'm reminding myself
[01:57.82]Cuz a face without freckles is a sky without stars
[02:03.80]Why waste a second not loving who you are
[02:08.74]Those little imperfections make you
[02:12.34]beautiful, lovable, valuable,
[02:16.48]They show your personality inside your heart
[02:22.28]Reflecting who you are
[02:28.24]Reflecting who you are
[02:33.79]Reflecting who you are Hmmm
[02:42.06]Whoooooo whoa hmmmm oooooo
[02:51.24]Cuz a face without freckles is a sky without stars
[02:58.08]Why waste a second not loving who you are
[03:02.82]Those little imperfections make you
[03:06.64]beautiful, lovable, valuable,
[03:11.00]They show your personality inside your heart
