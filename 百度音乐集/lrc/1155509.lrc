[00:11.35]Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
[00:15.78]Suicide is slow with liquer
[00:20.19]Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
[00:24.51]Then it floods away tommorows
[00:32.21]Away tommorows
[00:38.71]Evil thoughts and evil doings
[00:43.11]Cold, alone you hang in ruins
[00:47.43]Thought that you'd escape the reaper
[00:51.96]You can't escape the master keeper
[00:56.30]'Cos you feel life's unreal, and you're living a lie
[01:00.57]Such a shame, who's to blame, and you're wondering why
[01:05.15]Then you ask from your cask, is there life after birth
[01:09.42]What you saw can mean hell on this earth
[01:16.87]Hell on this earth
[01:22.90]Now you live inside a bottle
[01:27.29]The reaper's travelling at full throttle
[01:31.74]It's catching you, but you don't see
[01:35.80]The reaper's you, and the reaper is me
[01:41.08]Breaking laws, knocking doors
[01:43.08]But there's no one at home
[01:45.54]Made your bed, rest your head
[01:47.53]But you lie there and moan
[01:49.65]Where to hide, suicide is the only way out
[01:54.11]Don't you know what it's really about
[01:58.76]
[02:48.39]Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
[02:52.78]Suicide is slow with liquer
[02:57.25]Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
[03:01.61]Then it floods away tomorrows
