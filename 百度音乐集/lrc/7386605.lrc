[00:11.46]Billy Ray was a preacher's son
[00:13.47]And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
[00:16.66]When they gathered around and started talking
[00:19.20]That's when Billy would take me walking
[00:21.97]Out through the backyard we'd go walking
[00:24.70]Then he'd look into my eyes

[01:28.55]The look that was in his eyes
[01:31.01]Stealing kisses from me on the sly
