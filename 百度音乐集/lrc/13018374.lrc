[00:13.92]The falling leaves
[00:18.71]drift by the window
[00:22.74]The autumn leaves
[00:26.63]of red and gold
[00:30.58]I see your lips
[00:34.50]The summer kisses
[00:38.64]The sunburned hands
[00:42.19]I used to hold
[00:44.99]
[00:46.31]Since you went away
[00:50.18]The days grow long
[00:54.37]And soon I'll hear
[00:57.48]old winter's song
[01:02.68]But I miss you most of all, my darling
[01:10.70]When autumn leaves
[01:13.80]start to fall
[01:17.36]
[01:47.05]Since you went away
[01:51.46]The days grow long
[01:55.60]And soon I'll hear
[01:59.34]old winter's song
[02:06.95]But I miss you most of all, my darling
[02:15.33]When autumn leaves
[02:20.36]start to fall
[02:27.09]
