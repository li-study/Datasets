[00:08.48]Title: Legend
[00:10.85]
[01:04.11]Candlelight shades
[01:05.50]dance upon her glance,
[01:09.74]stands in loneliness,
[01:11.60]her mind to hope...forever,
[01:15.15]an angel without wings that's her destiny,
[01:20.94]she feels the emptyness killing her soul
[01:25.35]
[01:26.19]Rain, blood, storm and thunders,
[01:30.31]run Aurienne through the night,
[01:33.25]...storm and thunders, until
[01:34.98]
[01:36.24]I'll take your hands tonight,
[01:42.57]you'll live over the ages and fly
[01:44.12]through the gates of wisdom,
[01:48.13]Your eyes will see the power,
[01:53.48]the strenght of a world where
[01:54.76]emotions and feelings are life
[01:58.95]
[02:10.70]I see a sphere, shining bright,
[02:14.42]it invades me, it fills my eyes
[02:18.17]
[02:21.23]These words tear
[02:22.53]a silence made of steel,
[02:26.53]darkin' times were slowly rapin' her smile,
[02:32.16]appears a tear, slowly falling,
[02:37.38]bringing away the pain,
[02:42.16]uh, the first tear of joy,
[02:48.58]after the last one of sadness
[02:54.75]
[02:58.16]Run Aurienne through the night, until
[03:04.13]
[03:05.01]I'll take your hands tonight,
[03:10.18]you'll live over the ages and fly
[03:11.57]through the gates of wisdom,
[03:15.87]Your eyes will see the power,
[03:21.27]the strenght of a world where
[03:23.13]emotions and feelings are life
[04:04.99]
[04:40.00]Shadows surround my life,
[04:43.92]I'll tear them,
[04:45.15]with the force of mind,
[04:47.29]I have no...fear,
[04:49.84]never think you'd die without light,
[04:52.56]you're much stronger
[04:59.93]
[05:06.67]Wings of power now raise me
[05:11.94]I'm overfliyng the time
