[00:00.23]In Christ Alone
[00:08.55]Brian Littrell
[00:15.85]In Christ alone will I glory
[00:20.49]Though I could pride myself in battles won
[00:26.72]For I've been blessed beyond measure
[00:31.06]And by His strength alone I overcome
[00:38.53]Oh I could stop and count successes
[00:43.35]Like diamonds in my hand
[00:48.62]But those trophies could not equal
[00:52.24]To the grace by which I stand
[00:58.40]In Christ alone I place my trust
[01:05.43]And find my glory in the power of the cross
[01:12.44]In every victory let it be said of me
[01:20.35]My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone
[01:34.11]In Christ alone will I glory
[01:38.29]For only by His grace I am redeemed
[01:44.61]And only His tender mercy
[01:48.58]Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
[01:56.12]Now I seek no greater honor
[02:01.10]Than just to know Him more
[02:06.36]And to count my gains
[02:08.46]But losses to the glory of my Lord
[02:16.06]In Christ alone I place my trust
[02:22.96]And find my glory in the power of the cross
[02:29.76]In every victory let it be said of me
[02:37.68]My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone
[02:44.72]In Christ alone I place my trust
[02:51.41]And find my glory in the power of the cross
[02:58.51]In every victory let it be said of me
[03:06.47]My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone
[03:19.91]Is Christ alone
