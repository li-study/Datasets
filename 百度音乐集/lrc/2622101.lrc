[00:02.37]I open up my head
[00:03.22]Inside I find another person's mind
[00:05.70]I'm gonna take this chance I've got
[00:11.02]I run denying as we speak
[00:12.90]Hiding my face among the weak
[00:17.61]Some say their day is all away
[00:20.63]Into the wild
[00:23.40]I'm with a mission
[00:25.45]Over the hill
[00:28.15]Come here with me
[00:30.66]Into the wild
[00:35.59]Into the wild
[00:41.32]High above the serpentine
[01:13.18]I cross below the well - worn lines
[01:15.90]Entangled in a missing memory
[01:21.60]I find an oversight
[01:24.10]I formed this sword that will give rise
[01:26.44]To something the world is here to seize
[01:31.42]Into the wild
[01:36.90]Into the wild
[02:02.13]Into the wild
[02:04.12]I'm with a mission
[02:06.59]Over the hill
[02:09.25]Come here with me
[02:32.47]Into the wild
[02:34.32]I'm with a mission
[02:36.90]Over the hill
[02:39.45]Come here with me
