[00:00.00]Falling Free
[00:03.56]
[00:14.06]When I move a certain way,
[00:18.04]I feel an ache I’ve kept at bay.
[00:22.17]A hairline break, this aching hold
[00:26.35]A medal that I thought was gold.
[00:30.91]And pure so sure it struck a vain.
[00:33.49]I wanted you to feel the same
[00:35.37]So when you did ignite his heart,
[00:37.62]Rescue me from all this dark.
[00:40.02]See our hearts are intertwined,
[00:41.92]Then I’m free, free of mine,
[00:44.32]I’m falling free.
[00:48.64]Then see our hearts are intertwined,
[00:52.66]And then I’m free, I’m free of mine.
[00:56.77]Deep and pure our hearts align.
[01:01.28]And then I’m free, I’m free of mine.
[01:06.15]
[01:11.02]When I raise the certain wing,
[01:14.16]And crawl beneath that growing thing.
[01:18.57]It throws a shadow over time,
[01:22.96]And keeps yours falling next to mine.
[01:27.31]Your days were meant to fly anew,
[01:30.04]I’ve fallen ??? mine into you,
[01:32.12]And what you take is just enough,
[01:34.45]And what you give is what I love.
[01:36.73]And when you live(lift) you raise the sand,
[01:38.79]And then I’m free, free to fail,
[01:40.89]I’m falling free.
[01:45.74]Deep and pure our hearts align,
[01:51.44]Then I'm free, I'm free of mine.
[01:55.74]When I let loose the need to know,
[02:00.10]Then we're both free, we're free to go.
[02:05.47]
[02:09.31]When I lose a certain claim,
[02:13.36]That tries to know and needs to blame.
[02:17.67]Whatever river runs aground,
[02:22.25]It turns my head and washes down.
[02:26.57]The face of God that stands above,
[02:28.95]pouring over hope and love,
[02:31.28]That all of might and life and limb,
[02:33.56]Can turn around a love again.
[02:35.52]When I let loose the need to know,
[02:37.64]Then we're both free, free to go.
[02:39.82]I'm falling free.
[02:45.00]I’m fallin, I’m fallin, I’m falling free.
[02:55.30]I’m fallin, I’m fallin, I’m falling free
[03:04.01]Deep and pure our hearts aligned,
[03:07.76]And then I’m free, I’m free of mine.
[03:12.23]When I let loose the need to know,
[03:16.33]Then we’re both free, we’re free to go.
[03:21.80]
[04:16.10]Deep and pure our hearts aligned,
[04:21.37]And then I’m free, I’m free of mine.
[04:28.03]When I let loose the need to know,
[04:34.67]Then we’re both free, free to go.
