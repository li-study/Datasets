[00:07.18]
[00:28.40]Rising above tension below
[00:34.15]Learn from the in-between
[00:39.75]Blinded by trust, asleep to the truth
[00:45.22]Awakened by disbelief
[00:50.99]Somewhere I found strength in my soul
[00:56.35]Still you refuse to see
[01:01.12]
[01:01.52]Are you sure I'm not all right?
[01:12.83]'Cause lately I've been feeling fine!
[01:24.52]Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
[01:35.47]But I have seen you run in circles, unforgiven
[01:44.44]Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?!
[01:48.39]Oh, you're a machine!
[01:51.71]
[02:01.52]A world of your own
[02:04.42]Hollow inside
[02:07.36]Careful when worlds collide
[02:12.66]I'm filling my life
[02:15.57]With all it can hold
[02:18.54]Carry it on with pride
[02:23.54]
[02:24.25]Are you sure I'm not all right?
[02:34.83]Cause lately I've been feeling fine!
[02:46.41]Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
[02:57.50]But I have seen you run in circles, unforgiven
[03:06.50]Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?!
[03:10.60]Oh, you're a machine!
[03:14.63]
[03:23.15]The sun's still above
[03:28.19]All the rain that's coming down
[03:35.00]And I can feel the clouds drifting away
[03:44.73]And now the sky is open wide!
[03:54.52]
[04:16.95]Turn the light on, you will see things
[04:21.85]So much clearer
[04:26.22]Ohh, but there's no heart
[04:30.14]Oh, there's no heart, and I've spent all this time feeling
[04:36.57]Something you can't feel at all!
[04:38.99]You're a machine!
[04:44.19]Oh, you're a machine.
