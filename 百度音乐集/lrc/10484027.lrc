[00:02.39]Anywhere Is
[00:04.27]Enya
[00:06.27]
[00:09.27]I walk the maze of moments,
[00:11.84]But everywhere I turn to,
[00:14.29]Begins a new beginning,
[00:16.55]But never finds a finish.
[00:19.22]I walk to the horizon,
[00:21.45]And there I find another,
[00:23.91]It all seems so surprising,
[00:26.31]And then I find that I know.
[00:30.57]You go there you're gone forever.
[00:33.11]I go there I'll lose my way.
[00:35.42]If we stay here we're not together.
[00:37.93]Anywhere is.
[00:40.45]The moon upon the ocean
[00:43.12]is swept around in motion.
[00:45.79]But without ever knowing
[00:48.23]the reason for its flowing.
[00:50.63]In motion on the ocean,
[00:53.10]the moon still keeps on moving.
[00:55.63]The waves still keep on waving.
[00:57.92]And I still keep on going.
[01:02.36]You go there you're gone forever.
[01:04.52]I go there I'll lose my way.
[01:06.98]If we stay here we're not together.
[01:09.50]Anywhere is.
[01:13.13]I wonder if the stars sign,
[01:15.55]the life that is to be mine.
[01:18.06]And would they let their light shine
[01:20.49]Enough for me to follow.
[01:23.09]I look up to the heavens,
[01:25.65]But night has clouded over.
[01:28.11]No spark of constellation,
[01:30.33]No Vela no Orion.
[01:32.88]
[02:04.65]The shells upon the warm sands
[02:07.13]Have taken from their own lands.
[02:09.83]The echo of their story,
[02:12.30]But all I hear are low sounds,
[02:14.73]As pillow words are weaving.
[02:17.06]And willow waves are leaving,
[02:19.61]But should I be believing
[02:22.04]That I am only dreaming.
[02:26.18]You go there you're gone forever.
[02:28.60]I go there I'll lose my way.
[02:31.11]If we stay here we're not together.
[02:33.59]Anywhere is.
[02:37.07]To leave the thread of all time,
[02:39.54]And let it make a dark line
[02:42.21]In hopes that I can still find
[02:44.84]The way back to the moment.
[02:47.02]I took the turn and turned to
[02:49.45]Begin a new beginning,
[02:51.85]Still looking for the answer,
[02:54.58]I cannot find the finish.
[02:57.09]It's either this or that way,
[02:59.35]It's one way or the other.
[03:01.92]It should be one direction,
[03:04.28]It could be on reflection.
[03:06.79]The turn I have just taken,
[03:09.26]The turn that I was making.
[03:11.81]I might be just beginning,
[03:14.14]I might be near the end.
[03:16.75]
