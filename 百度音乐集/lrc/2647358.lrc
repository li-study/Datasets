[00:16.71]Hummer
[00:37.76]
[01:18.40]Faith lies in
[01:23.47]The ways of sin
[01:30.22]I chased the charmed
[01:35.27]But I don't want them anymore
[01:41.02]
[01:45.40]And in their eyes I was alive
[01:53.67]A fool's disguise
[01:55.03]Take me away from you
[01:58.50]
[02:00.36]Shame my tongue
[02:03.84]Fat with promise all along
[02:09.56]But when I woke up from that sleep
[02:15.45]I was happier than I'd ever been
[02:20.51]
[02:21.62]When you decide
[02:26.85]That your life is a prize
[02:33.11]Renew and revive
[02:38.61]It's alright honey
[02:42.05]It's alright, yeah
[02:45.04]
[02:51.91]Happiness will make you wonder
[02:57.27]Will I feel OK?
[03:04.00]It scares the disenchanted
[03:07.61]Far away
[03:10.63]
[03:32.36]Yeah I want something new
[03:37.87]But what am I supposed to do about you
[03:43.35]Yeah I love you, it's true
[03:51.07]
[04:07.16]Life's a bummer
[04:12.32]When you're a hummer
[04:18.19]Life's a drag
[04:23.60]
[05:04.51]Ask yourself a question
[05:07.20]Anyone but me
[05:10.77]I ain't free
[05:13.01]
[05:15.71]Ask yourself a question
[05:19.53]Anyone but me
[05:21.93]I ain't free
[05:27.31]
[05:28.36]Do you feel
[05:38.19]Love is real?
