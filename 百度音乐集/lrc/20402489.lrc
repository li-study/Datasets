[00:00.23]Lene Marlin
[00:00.33]
[00:01.83]I'm sitting down here but hey, you can't see me.
[00:05.91]
[00:24.76]Your words cut rather deeply
[00:27.15]They're just some other lies
[00:29.02]I'm hiding from a distance
[00:30.77]I've got to pay the price
[00:32.74]Defending all against it
[00:34.74]I really don't know why
[00:36.77]You're obsessed with all my secrets
[00:38.62]You always make me cry
[00:40.65]You seem to wanna hurt me
[00:42.56]No matter what I do
[00:44.40]I'm telling just a couple
[00:46.24]But somehow it gets to you
[00:47.96]But I've learned to get revenge
[00:49.80]And I swear you'll experience that someday
[00:54.57]
[00:55.82]I'm sitting down here but hey, you can't see me
[01:00.00]Kinda invisible, you don't sense my stay
[01:03.73]Not really hiding, not like a shadow
[01:07.64]Just thought I would join you for one day
[01:11.35]I'm sitting down here but hey, you can't see me
[01:15.49]
[01:19.02]I'm not trying to avoid you
[01:21.23]Just don't wanna hear your voice
[01:23.31]When you call me up so often
[01:25.03]I don't really have a choice
[01:27.12]You're talking like you know me
[01:28.75]And wanna be my friend
[01:30.89]But that's really too late now
[01:32.81]I won't try it once again
[01:34.69]You may think that I'm a loser
[01:36.69]That I don't really care
[01:38.57]You may think that it's forgotten
[01:40.50]But you should be aware
[01:42.30]'Cause I've learned to get revenge
[01:44.18]And I swear you'll experience that someday
