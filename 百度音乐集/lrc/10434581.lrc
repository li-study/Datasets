[00:15.00]Song  : Big Mistake
[00:21.00]There's no sign on the gate
[00:26.00]and there's mud on your face
[00:31.00]Don't ya think it's time we re-investigate this situation?
[00:37.00]Put some fruit on your plate
[00:42.00]You've forgotten how it started.
[00:47.00]Close your eyes
[00:50.00]think of all the bubbles of love we made,
[00:53.00]and you're down on your knees
[00:57.00]it's too late.
[01:00.00]Oh don't come crawlin'
[01:03.00]and you lie by my feet.
[01:07.00]what a big mistake.
[01:10.00]I see you fallin'
[01:25.00]got a buzz in my head
[01:30.00]and my flowers are dead.
[01:35.00]Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation.
[01:40.00]I don't believe what you said
[02:49.00][01:46.00]you forgotten how it started
[02:54.00][01:51.00]Close your eyes
[02:57.00][01:53.00]think of all the bubbles of love we made
[03:41.00][02:59.00][01:56.00]and you're down on your knees
[03:45.00][03:04.00][02:00.00]it's too late.
[03:49.00][03:07.00][02:03.00]Oh don't come crawlin'
[03:52.00][03:10.00][02:06.00]and you lie by my feet.
[03:56.00][03:14.00][02:11.00]what a big mistake.
[03:59.00][03:17.00][02:14.00]I see you fallin'
[02:28.00]I could sting like a bee.
[02:33.00]Careful how you treat me
[02:38.00]baby I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation.
[02:44.00]Close the door as you leave
[03:21.00]and you cry over me.
[03:25.00]I can't wait.
[03:28.00]I feel you stallin'
[03:31.00]and you try to reach me.
[03:35.00]What a big mistake.
[03:38.00]I hear you calling.
