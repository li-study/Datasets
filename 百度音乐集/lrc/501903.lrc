[00:06.40]Damien Rice Lyrics
[00:11.15]
[00:14.49]Accidental Babies
[00:16.67]
[00:25.10]Well I held you like a lover
[00:27.00]Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place
[00:34.74]
[00:39.80]And we ignored our others, happy plans
[00:45.65]For that delicate look upon your face
[00:49.52]
[00:56.35]Our bodies moved and hardened
[00:59.87]Hurting parts of your garden
[01:03.79]With no room for a pardon
[01:07.56]In a place where no one knows what we have done
[01:12.11]
[01:17.75]Do you come
[01:25.22]Together ever with him?
[01:34.86]And is he dark enough?
[01:40.76]Enough to see your light?
[01:50.15]And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
[01:58.11]Do you miss my smell?
[02:05.86]And is he bold enough to take you on?
[02:13.83]Do you feel like you belong?
[02:21.23]And does he drive you wild?
[02:28.80]Or just mildly free?
[02:37.71]What about me?
[02:41.08]
[02:46.83]Well you held me like a lover
[02:50.65]Sweaty hands
[02:52.30]And my foot in the appropriate place
[03:00.73]
[03:03.13]And we use cushions to cover
[03:06.76]Happy glands
[03:08.50]In the mild issue of our disgrace
[03:14.45]
[03:18.90]Our minds pressed and guarded
[03:22.08]While our flesh disregarded
[03:26.39]The lack of space for the light-hearted In the boom that beats our drum
[03:36.20]
[03:41.25]Well I know I make you cry
[03:45.20]And I know sometimes you wanna die
[03:49.20]But do you really feel alive without me?
[03:56.54]If so, be free
[03:58.98]If not, leave him for me
[04:02.16]Before one of us has accidental babies
[04:12.11]For we are in love
[04:15.02]
[04:19.56]Do you come
[04:27.57]Together ever with him?
[04:37.09]Is he dark enough?
[04:42.47]Enough to see your light?
[04:51.92]Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
[05:00.14]Do you miss my smell?
[05:08.23]And is he bold enough to take you on?
[05:16.04]Do you feel like you belong?
[05:23.45]And does he drive you wild?
[05:30.47]Or just mildly free?
[05:36.07]
[05:39.28]What about me?
[05:47.55]What about me?
