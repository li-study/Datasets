[00:17.07]Boy I see you lookin' over
[00:20.78]You keep on looking back at what you knew
[00:25.92]When will you come closer
[00:29.30]Closer to the one that's good for you
[00:33.22]
[00:34.59]Cause you're still goin' back to that life
[00:38.67]And I refuse to stand on the side
[00:43.28]By sparing her from heartache
[00:47.04]Don't you know you end up hurting me
[00:51.28]
[00:51.90]I see your head spinning right around
[00:54.74]She makes you fall hard and hit the ground
[00:56.95]When you ever gonna let her go
[00:59.02]I see the way that she breaks you so
[01:01.08]All I'm asking is for you please
[01:03.39]To take control and be set free
[01:05.63]Make the space so we can grow
[01:07.66]Save us before I let you go
[01:16.17]
[01:18.11]So you say this will get better
[01:21.79]Better for you, her, or me?

[01:30.47]It's not my fault that I don't believe
[01:34.55]
[01:35.67]Cause you're still so stuck in that life
[01:39.77]And I refuse to stay on this ride
[01:44.19]Cause we're goin' round in circles
[01:48.04]Aren't you tired of never having peace
