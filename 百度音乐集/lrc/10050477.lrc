[00:08.45]Rocking around the Christmas tree
[00:11.57]At the Christmas party hop
[00:15.46]Mistletoe hung where you can see
[00:18.52]Every couple tries to stop
[00:22.51]Rocking around the Christmas tree,
[00:25.63]Let the Christmas spirit ring
[00:29.53]Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
[00:32.65]And we'll do some caroling.
[00:35.38]
[00:36.64]You will get a sentimental
[00:40.09]Feeling when you hear
[00:43.59]Voices singing let's be jolly,
[00:47.20]Deck the halls with boughs of holly
[00:50.76]Rocking around the Christmas tree,
[00:53.66]Have a happy holiday
[00:57.60]Everyone's dancing merrily
[01:00.68]In the new old-fashioned way.

[01:36.20]Feeling when you hear
[01:39.80]Voices singing let's be jolly,
[01:43.35]Deck the halls with boughs of holly
[01:46.75]Rocking around the Christmas tree,
