[00:01.11]I don't know your face, no more
[00:09.83]Or feel the touch, that I adore
[00:19.65]I don't know your face, no more
[00:27.96]It's just a place, I'm looking for

[00:52.96]We might as well
[00:56.29]We might as well
[01:02.98]

[02:31.38]For all I know of you now
[02:41.94]For all I know of you now
[02:51.74]For all I know
