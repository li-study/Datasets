[00:01.61]
[00:04.62]Did you know?
[00:07.32]That I'm contiguous watching you type on the phone
[00:12.40]Something as simple as hearing your tone
[00:18.10]It's enough for me to feel like I'm at home (oh yeah)
[00:25.40]Did you know?
[00:28.31]That each and every time you walk into a room
[00:33.21]My eyes are totally fixed on you
[00:38.48]I know you want to show me all that you can do
[00:43.71]But I think that you're confused
[00:47.28]
[00:48.39]I don't ask for much
[00:51.06]But I don't need anything
[00:55.61]Baby all that I ask
[00:58.87]My only request
[01:01.02]All that I really need
[01:04.92]Is too share the same air that you breathe
[01:08.98]
[01:10.20]Sometimes I just stay awake and watch you sleep
[01:14.94]And try to guess what you do in your dreams
[01:20.37]That's my favorite thing to do when you're with me (oh yeah)
[01:27.94]Did you know?
[01:30.89]That your smile lightens up through the night
[01:35.84]I like to think that happens when I'm on your mind
[01:41.09]I know you want to give the world to me tonight
[01:46.31]But you should realize
[01:50.01]
[01:51.03]I don't ask for much
[01:53.53]And I don't need anything
[01:58.39]Baby all that I ask
[02:01.44]My only request
[02:03.63]All that I really need
[02:07.44]Is too share the same air that you breathe
[02:11.55]
[02:12.11]And I'll be okay, as long as you're here with me yeah
[02:19.19]Baby promise me that, there's no turning back
[02:24.34]I'll be fine honestly,
[02:28.04]if I can share the same air that you breathe
[02:32.67]So you don't have to prove, that your love is true
[02:38.69]Might give you the world tonight, cause I'l be satisfied
[02:45.88]If I'm by your side,
[02:48.91]I get a butterfly from looking in your eyes
[02:53.77]I don't ask for much
[02:56.15]And I don't need anything
