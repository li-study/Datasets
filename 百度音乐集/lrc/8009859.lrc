[00:01.14]Killing Me Softly With His Song
[00:18.54]- Tracy Huang

[00:31.50]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[00:36.22]Singing my life with his words,
[00:40.68]Killing me softly with his song,
[00:44.01]Killing me softly with his song,
[00:48.40]Telling my whole life with his words,
[00:52.83]Killing me softly with his song.
[01:00.51]
[01:12.21]I heard he sang a good song,
[01:16.30]I heard he had a style,
[01:20.59]And so I came to see him
[01:23.83]to listen for a while.
[01:29.07]And there he was this young boy,
[01:33.39]A stranger to my eyes,
[01:36.81]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[01:41.03]Singing my life with his words,
[01:45.28]Killing me softly with his song,
[01:48.52]Killing me softly with his song,
[01:52.75]Telling my whole life with his words,
[01:56.94]Killing me softly with his song.
[02:04.42]
[02:07.36]I felt all flushed with fever,
[02:11.64]Embarrassed by the crowd,
[02:15.84]I felt he found my letters
[02:19.01]and read each one out loud.
[02:24.37]I prayed that he would finish,
[02:28.64]But he just kept right on
[02:32.05]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[02:36.32]Singing my life with his words,
[02:40.57]Killing me softly with his song,
[02:43.84]Killing me softly with his song,
[02:48.11]Telling my whole life with his words,
[02:52.34]Killing me softly with his song
[03:00.05]
[03:02.67]He sang as if he knew me ,
[03:06.82]In all my dark despair
[03:11.12]And then he looked right through me ,
[03:14.45]As if l wasn't there
[03:19.62]And he just keep on saying ,
[03:23.93]Sining clear and strong
[03:27.29]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[03:31.64]Singing my life with his words,
[03:35.87]Killing me softly with his song,
[03:39.05]Killing me softly with his song,
[03:43.34]Telling my whole life with his words,
[03:47.61]Killing me softly with his song.
[03:58.24]Oh... La... Oh... La...Ah...
[04:26.66]Strumming my pain with his fingers,
[04:30.64]Singing my life with his words,
[04:34.84]Killing me softly with his song,
[04:38.07]Killing me softly with his song,
[04:42.24]Telling my whole life with his words,
[04:46.41]Killing me softly with his song.
