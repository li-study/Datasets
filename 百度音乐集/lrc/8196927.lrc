[ti:Lay Down Your Weary Tune]

[00:01.07]Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
[00:06.06]Lay down the song you strum,
[00:09.61]And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
[00:14.14]No voice can hope to hum.
[00:18.94]Struck by the sounds before the sun,
[00:24.07]I knew the night had gone.
[00:27.83]The morning breeze like a bugle blew
[00:32.42]Against the drums of dawn.
[00:36.42]Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
[00:40.48]Lay down the song you strum,
[00:45.21]And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
[00:49.63]No voice can hope to hum.
[00:57.87]The ocean wild like an organ played,
[01:02.68]The seaweed's wove its strands.
[01:06.39]The crashin' waves like cymbals clashed
[01:10.70]Against the rocks and sands.
[01:15.93]I stood unwound beneath the skies
[01:19.87]And clouds unbound by laws.
[01:23.60]The crying rain like a trumpet sang
[01:27.98]And asked for no applause.
[01:31.92]Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
[01:35.43]Lay down the song you strum,
[01:40.83]And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
[01:45.17]No voice can hope to hum.
[02:10.35]The last of leaves fell from the trees
[02:15.83]And clung to a new love's breast.
[02:19.36]The branches bare like a banjo played
[02:23.61]To the winds that listened best.
[02:27.47]I gazed down in the river's mirror
[02:32.58]And watched its winding strum.
[02:36.26]The water smooth ran like a hymn
[02:40.60]And like a harp did hum.
[02:46.44]Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
[02:49.55]Lay down the song you strum,
[02:53.28]And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
[02:57.92]No voice can hope to hum.
[03:01.67]Lay down your weary tune, lay down,
[03:06.61]Lay down the song you strum,
[03:10.55]And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
[03:15.23]No voice can hope to hum.
