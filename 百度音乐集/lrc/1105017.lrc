[00:29.77]A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
[00:32.63]You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
[00:36.48]My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
[00:38.85]I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
[00:41.81]I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
[00:44.20]With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
[00:47.68]We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
[00:50.46]Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
[00:53.65]This is the season for noise pollution contamination
[00:56.29]Examination of more cartoons than animation
[00:59.35]My lamination of narration
[01:01.44]Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation

[01:11.40]
[01:11.71]You heard of hell well I was sent from it
[01:13.76]I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
[01:17.18]Now I'm trying to repent from it
[01:19.01]But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
[01:22.25]I'm Infinite
[01:22.76]
[01:32.78]Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
[01:37.14]I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse
[01:40.39]I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
[01:43.00]I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
[01:46.18]My coil hands around this microphone lethal
[01:48.84]One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
[01:51.79]MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
[01:54.56]Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
[01:58.06]Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
[02:03.17]There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
[02:06.50]Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
[02:09.17]My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
[02:11.53]My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
[02:14.87]And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
[02:19.07]With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
[02:21.49]

[02:47.39]My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
[02:51.05]So I'm assuming all responsibility
[02:53.48]Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
[02:56.55]Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
[02:58.90]Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
[03:02.07]No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
[03:04.92]I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
[03:07.84]I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
[03:11.38]I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy
[03:14.95]In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
[03:16.88]A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
[03:20.15]This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
[03:24.04]Plus the man who never had a plan B
[03:25.84]Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
[03:28.62]I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
[03:31.35]I'm Infinite
