[00:18.81]Sunday is Gloomy,
[00:22.20]My hours are slumberless,
[00:26.72]Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
[00:33.30]Little white flowers will never awaken you
[00:46.02]Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
[00:50.78]Angels have no thought of ever returning you
[01:00.66]Would they be angry if I thought of joining you
[01:14.96]Gloomy Sunday
[01:22.81]
[01:42.43]Sunday is gloomy
[01:46.59]with shadows I spend it all
[01:48.49]My heart and I have decided to end it all
[01:55.47]Soon there’ll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
[02:01.39]I know, let them not weep,
[02:08.66]Let them know that I’m glad to go
[02:17.56]
[02:18.24]Death is no dream,
[02:20.99]For in death I’m caressing you
[02:26.15]With the last breath of my soul I’ll be blessing you
[02:31.27]Gloomy Sunday
[02:36.68]
[03:03.31]Dreaming
[03:10.13]I was only dreaming
[03:14.65]I wake and I find you
[03:24.43]Asleep in the deep of
[03:27.99]My heart
[03:33.86]Dear
[03:38.35]
[03:43.03]Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
[03:49.18]My heart is telling you how much I wanted you
[04:03.87]Gloomy Sunday
