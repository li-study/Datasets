[00:17.71]Do you know that I'm OK?
[00:21.79]Are there things you wanna say?
[00:25.77]Thinking of you night and day
[00:29.78]Hopping you'll come back and stay
[00:33.79]I remember when you told me
[00:36.82]I'll be all right
[00:40.69]Don't worry...

[01:48.58]You'll always be my heart and mind
[01:52.50]So I don't wanna close my eyes tonight
[01:56.64]I know it's just a miss match in time...
