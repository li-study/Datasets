[00:00.00]"Born To Lead"
[00:08.80]
[00:13.22]With eyes closed tightly,
[00:17.02]I march so blindly.
[00:20.99]Pretending everything's fine,
[00:24.87]'Cause you're there to keep me in line.
[00:33.26]I don't want your guidance,
[00:37.10]I'll break my silence.
[00:41.03]So sick of asking and being denied and now I realise.
[00:48.77]
[00:49.46]We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
[00:54.27]We were Born To Lead.
[00:57.48]We're finally free, no longer following,
[01:02.38]We were Born To Lead... we were Born To Lead.
[01:07.02]
[01:10.22]You can't ignore me (you can't ingnore me)
[01:13.87]You cant think for me (you can't think for me)
[01:18.14]Your world will come crashing down to the ground,
[01:22.95]'Cause I figured you out.
[01:25.69]
[01:26.14]We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
[01:30.41]We were Born To Lead.
[01:34.18]We're finally free, no longer following,
[01:40.04]We were Born To Lead... we were Born To Lead.
[01:47.39]
[02:00.14]I use to think I'm ALL alone,
[02:04.18]But now I see our numbers grow.
[02:08.25]I'm not afraid to break away,
[02:12.12]Think on my own
[02:17.24]
[02:24.08]With eyes wide open,
[02:27.78]My new life begins.
[02:32.10]Without you there to tell me, when, where and how,
[02:36.94]And you can't stop me now!
[02:39.37]
[02:40.15]We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
[02:44.74]We were Born To Lead.
[02:48.10]We're finally free, no longer following,
[02:52.94]We were Born To Lead... we were Born To Lead.
[02:56.84]
[02:57.03]We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
[03:01.39]We were Born To Lead
[03:04.85]We're finally free, no longer following,
[03:09.58]We were Born To Lead.
[03:16.73]"NOT today ladies ,NOT today NOT yesterday.NOT tonight.........."
