[00:09.29]This is a New Year lullaby, I can not fake it.
[00:16.30]You know the reasons, don't ask why.
[00:23.23]When I got drunk and crashed the car, were you still near me?
[00:32.09]Still I've got writing on my face.
[00:38.97]Minute by minute, day by day,
[00:43.96]Though I can touch you you're so far away.
[00:47.31]Minute by minute, day by day,
[00:54.26]Minute by minute, day by day,
[00:59.14]Though I can touch you you're so far away.
[01:02.84]Minute by minute, day by day, two packs a day.

[03:05.38]Now that its all been said and done, our house is empty.
[03:14.26]Where do I go now you have gone?
[03:21.91]Minute by minute, day by day,
[03:25.77]Though I can touch you you're so far away.
[03:29.77]Minute by minute, day by day. Ooh.
