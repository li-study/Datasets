[00:03.49]Madonna 
[00:04.66]
[00:06.74]If you were the Mona Lisa
[00:11.77]You’d be hanging in the Louvre
[00:17.15]Everyone would come to see you
[00:22.24]You’d be impossible to move
[00:28.19]It seems to me is what you are
[00:34.13]A rare and priceless work of art
[00:39.29]Stay behind your velvet rope
[00:45.07]But I will not renounce all hope
[00:49.24]
[00:49.75]And I’m right by your side
[00:53.58]Like a thief in the night
[00:56.21]I stand in front of a masterpiece
[01:00.36]And I can’t tell you why
[01:04.43]It hurts so much
[01:07.03]To be in love with the masterpiece
[01:11.82]‘Cause after all
[01:15.94]Nothing’s indestructible
[01:18.65]
[01:18.85]From the moment I first saw you
[01:23.39]All the darkness turned to light
[01:28.89]An impressionistic painting
[01:34.34]Tiny particles of light
[01:39.61]It seem to me is what you’re like
[01:45.96]The “look but please don’t touch me” type
[01:51.30]And honestly it can’t be fun
[01:56.41]To always be the chosen one
[02:00.89]
[02:01.59]And I’m right by your side
[02:05.12]Like a thief in the night
[02:07.79]I stand in front of a masterpiece
[02:11.80]And I can’t tell you why
[02:15.90]It hurts so much
[02:18.46]To be in love with a masterpiece
[02:23.25]
[02:24.38]‘Cause after all
[02:27.44]Nothing’s indestructible
[02:33.22]Nothing’s indestructible
[02:38.06]Nothing’s indestructible
[02:44.32]Nothing’s indestructible
[02:47.74]
[02:51.21]And I’m right by your side
[02:54.92]Like a thief in the night
[02:57.48]I stand in front of a masterpiece
[03:01.87]And I can’t tell you why
[03:06.04]It hurts so much
[03:08.36]To be in love with a masterpiece
[03:13.20]And I’m right by your side
[03:17.00]Like a thief in the night
[03:19.51]I stand in front of a masterpiece
[03:23.49]And I can’t tell you why
[03:27.60]It hurts so much
