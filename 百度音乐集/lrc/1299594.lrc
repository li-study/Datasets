[00:09.54]Call you up in the middle of the night
[00:13.60]Like a firefly without a light
[00:17.67]You were there like a blowtorch burning
[00:21.67]I was a key that could use a little turning
[00:25.76]So tired that I couldn't even sleep
[00:29.80]So many secrets I couldn't keep
[00:33.94]I promised myself I wouldn't weep
[00:37.89]One more promise I couldn't keep
[00:41.29]It seems no one can help me now,
[00:45.09]I'm in too deep; there's no way out
[00:49.42]This time I have really led myself astray
[00:58.33]Runaway train, never going back
[01:01.93]Wrong way on a one-way track
[01:06.46]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[01:10.57]Somehow I'm neither here nor there
[01:18.76]Can you help me remember how to smile?
[01:22.86]Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
[01:26.91]How on earth did I get so jaded?
[01:31.02]Life's mystery seems so faded
[01:34.97]I can go where no one else can go
[01:39.12]I know what no one else knows
[01:43.18]Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain
[01:47.19]With a ticket for a runaway train
[01:50.41]And everything seems cut and dried,
[01:54.62]Day and night, earth and sky,
[01:58.62]Somehow I just don't believe it
[02:07.57]Runaway train, never going back
[02:11.64]Wrong way on a one-way track
[02:15.69]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[02:19.85]Somehow I'm neither here nor there
[02:24.64]
[02:56.42]Bought a ticket for a runaway train
[03:00.50]Like a madman laughing at the rain
[03:04.72]A little out of touch, a little insane
[03:08.85]It's just easier than dealing with the pain
[03:13.09]Runaway train, never going back
[03:17.05]Wrong way on a one-way track
[03:21.13]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[03:25.28]Somehow I'm neither here nor there
[03:29.35]Runaway train, never coming back
[03:33.50]Runaway train, tearing up the track
[03:37.57]Runaway train, burning in my veins
[03:41.72]I run away but it always seems the same
