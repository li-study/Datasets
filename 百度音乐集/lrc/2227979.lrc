[00:26.68]I know a girl who’s like the sea
[00:31.41]I watch her changing every day for me
[00:35.76]Oh yeah
[00:39.66]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[00:41.67]
[00:45.87]One day she’s still, the next she swells
[00:50.60]You can hear the universe in her sea shells
[00:54.21]Oh yeah
[00:58.90]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[01:00.84]
[01:04.66]No, no line on the horizon, no line
[01:11.86]
[01:14.65]I know a girl with a hole in her heart
[01:19.30]She said infinity is a great place to start
[01:24.21]
[01:27.75]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[01:29.87]
[01:33.82]She said “Time is irrelevant, it’s not linear”
[01:38.61]Then she put her tongue in my ear
[01:47.01]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[02:02.05]No, no line on the horizon, no line
[02:06.76]No, no line
[02:09.25]
[02:30.76]The songs in your head are now on my mind
[02:35.23]You put me on pause
[02:37.97]I’m trying to rewind and replay
[02:48.68]
[02:50.54]Every night I have the same dream
[02:55.32]I’m hatching some plot, scheming some scheme
[02:59.18]Oh yeah
[03:00.75]
[03:03.73]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:05.80]
[03:09.51]I’m traffic cop, due de marais
[03:14.47]The sirens are wailing but it’s me that wants to get away
[03:20.35]
[03:22.93]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:26.26]
[03:28.74]No, no line on the horizon, no line
[03:33.20]No, no line
[03:38.12]No, no line on the horizon, no line
[03:42.96]No, no line
