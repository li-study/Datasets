[00:12.35]I learned a lesson in my life
[00:15.72]But I learned it the hard way
[00:21.21]I don't know why I used to fall in love
[00:25.66]With the wrong kind
[00:31.49]Then I suffer so much pain
[00:36.00]But I only had myself to blame
[00:41.12]maybe you came
[00:43.65]In the nick of time to show me
[00:46.89]Love doesn't have to hurt
[00:51.29]To feel good
[00:55.05]It's such a revelation
[00:57.67]With you I can be myself
[01:01.41]I know it should
[01:02.78]Don't have to cry
[01:03.98]Don't have to fight
[01:05.20]Don't have to die
[01:06.47]Not after tonight

[01:25.03]Darling now it seems to me
[01:29.02]Like I've always known you
[01:34.03]But I still shudder
[01:35.90]When I think back
[01:38.49]On the lonely times
[01:44.30]I used to keep all my feelings inside
[01:49.81]From your eyes I have nothing to hide
[01:54.39]Baby you came
[01:57.40]In the nick of time to show me
