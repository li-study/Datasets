[00:02.41]Fireworks
[00:04.56]Kate Walsh
[00:06.51]
[00:08.42]It's that time of year again
[00:15.10]I think I'll stay in tonight
[00:24.02]My dogs are barking
[00:28.45]Shaking scared
[00:31.72]We don't light fireworks in this house
[00:40.39]I hate the way they shoot and sparkle
[00:48.16]It reminds me of a time I often clung to
[00:56.44]And when I see the Catherine wheel turn
[01:04.46]it only leaves me with heartburn
[01:11.77]
[01:12.48]Cause it's the 5th of November
[01:16.22]It's the 5th of November
[01:20.39]It's the 5th and these fireworks make me blue
[01:28.57]Cause it's the 5th of November
[01:32.46]It's the 5th of November
[01:36.63]It's the 5th and I remember rain
[01:42.97]
[01:49.60]It's cold out there
[01:52.90]The grass is wet
[01:56.50]And I don't care for muddy in my shoes
[02:05.20]I can see them from the window
[02:09.57]See them if I want to
[02:13.97]Leave me here with arms that I can cling to
[02:21.46]Children getting louder and louder
[02:29.32]May you roll around the sky like thunder
[02:37.38]And later all my friends will come to tell me
[02:45.81]about amazing fireworks they've seen
[02:53.32]
[02:53.61]Cause it's the 5th of November
[02:57.32]It's the 5th of November
[03:01.27]It's the 5th and these fireworks make me blue
[03:09.69]Cause it's the 5th of November
[03:13.46]It's the 5th of November
[03:17.69]It's the 5th and I remember rain
[03:25.17]
