[00:10.00]So this is who I am,
[00:16.00]And this is all I know,
[00:22.00]And I must choose to live,
[00:25.00]For all that I can give,
[00:28.00]The spark that makes the power grow
[00:33.00]And I will stand for my dream if I can,
[00:39.00]Symbol of my faith in who I am,
[00:45.00]But you are my only,
[00:50.00]And I must follow on the road that lies ahead,
[00:57.00]And I won't let my heart control my head,
[01:03.00]But you are my only
[01:14.00][01:08.00]We don't say goodbye,
[01:20.00]And I know what I've got to be
[01:26.00]Immortality
[01:32.00]I make my journey through eternity
[01:38.00]I keep the memory of you and me inside
[01:47.00]Fulfill your destiny,
[01:53.00]Is there within the child,
[01:58.00]My storm will never end,
[02:02.00]My fate is on the wind,
[02:05.00]The king of hearts, the joker's wild,
[02:10.00]But we don't say goodbye,
[02:16.00]We don't say goodbye
[02:22.00]I'll make them all remember me
[02:28.00]Cos I have found a dream that must come true,
[02:33.00]Every ounce of me must see it though,
[02:39.00]But you are my only
[02:44.00]I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play,
[02:51.00]Hand over my heart I'll find my way,
[02:57.00]I will make them give to me
[03:03.00]Immortality
[03:09.00]There is a vision and a fire in me
[03:14.00]I keep the memory of you and me, inside
[03:24.00]And we don't say goodbye
[03:30.00]We don't say goodbye
[03:36.00]With all my love for you
[03:39.00]And what else we may do
[03:45.00]We don't say, goodbye
