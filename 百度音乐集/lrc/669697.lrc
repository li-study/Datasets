[00:01.58]Song: How Come
[00:02.50]
[00:10.91]How come we dont even talk no more,
[00:14.05]and you dont even call no more.
[00:15.88]We dont barely keep in touch at all,
[00:17.89]and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more.
[00:21.13]And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now.
[00:24.49]After all the years we been down,
[00:26.55]aint no way no how, this bullshit can't be true.
[00:29.85]We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you
[00:32.98]
[00:33.49]So young, so full of life in vibrant,
[00:34.20]side by side wherever you was ridin' I went.
[00:38.05]So close, almost on some Bonnie & Clyde shit.
[00:40.74]When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on,
[00:44.57]tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it.
[00:48.71]You even had the same type of childhood I did.
[00:51.47]Sometimes I just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
[00:54.80]and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it.
[00:59.06]We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us,
[01:01.75]then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises.
[01:04.41]Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it,
[01:06.97]as much as your pride tries to hide it.
[01:09.02]Your cold, your touch it's just like ice
[01:10.92]in your eyes is the look of resenment
[01:12.59]I can sense it, and I dont like it.
[01:14.45]
[01:15.03]How come we dont even talk no more,
[01:17.36]and you dont even call no more.
[01:19.16]We dont barely keep in touch at all,
[01:21.15]and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more.
[01:24.39]And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now.
[01:27.70]After all the years we been down,
[01:29.77]aint no way no how, this bullshit can't be true.
[01:33.11]We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you
[01:36.73]
[01:37.18]It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse
[01:38.64]on my own album with a deal but shit got worse.
[01:41.28]So I came out, I woulda killed a nigga first
[01:44.03]before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst.
[01:46.58]Some bitch that I wasn't with, I would hit her then quit.
[01:49.18]But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit.
[01:51.96]I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
[01:55.11]comin' out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
[01:57.30]like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'.
[01:59.30]But me catchin' you fuckin' other niggers musta hurt your pride or somethin'
[02:02.48]cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me,
[02:05.33]when all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty.
[02:08.00]And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced,
[02:10.75]you actin' like I ain't your man and lyin' like she can't be loose.
[02:13.31]But I am really your friend, I'm just tryin' to tell you the truth,
[02:15.86]but dont hate the game or the player
[02:17.53]cause the one that's changing is you.
[02:18.42]
[02:19.41]How come we dont even talk no more,
[02:21.76]and you dont even call no more.
[02:23.67]We dont barely keep in touch at all,
[02:25.88]and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more.
[02:28.95]And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now.
[02:32.32]After all the years we been down,
[02:34.43]aint no way no how, this bullshit can't be true.
[02:37.65]We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you
[02:41.28]
[02:41.67]You're only at the top cause my homie had to stop,
[02:43.20]now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block.
[02:45.69]And homies in the hood, only she be on the tube,
[02:48.59]only gossip on the porch, get to speakin' on who.
[02:51.09]Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
[02:53.89]
[02:56.46]But Proof is just actin out the party was stoned,
[02:58.94]Shady made it so my babys ain't starvin' at home.
[03:01.50]See the devil in you grin, since the ghetto we been friends,
[03:04.49]whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end.
[03:07.05]I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
[03:09.61]and wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise.
[03:12.38](How come) when you talk it's with bitter and spite,
[03:14.98]and (How come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
[03:17.54]and everytime I go to hear you and play you look away.
[03:20.47]We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.
[03:23.48]
[03:24.02]How come we dont even talk no more,
[03:25.99]and you dont even call no more.
[03:27.78]We dont barely keep in touch at all,
[03:29.97]and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more.
[03:33.02]And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now.
[03:36.34]After all the years we been down,
[03:38.41]aint no way no how, this bullshit can't be true.
[03:41.67]We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you
