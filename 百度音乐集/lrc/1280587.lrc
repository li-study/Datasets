[00:01.50]
[00:03.65]Love can be so cold
[00:08.69]Love can be so cold
[00:15.53]I think it's time that I told you the truth, yeah
[00:20.10]'Cause it's on my mind
[00:22.02]So let me do what I gotta do, yeah
[00:25.14]'Cause it's someone else
[00:27.13]So I can't see you no more
[00:29.46]I can finally see my smile again
[00:32.02]'Cause he's the one my heart beats for
[00:35.45]He makes me feel like I'm his number one, his prize
[00:40.20]Tells me everyday I'm his everything
[00:42.73]And I never got that from you (that from you)
[00:45.26]So don't try to change my mind
[00:47.68]'Cause I've had enough this time
[00:50.22]And you always let me down
[00:52.11]And now you can't turn your back around
[00:54.48]Ain't it cold
[00:55.66]When the one you love lets you go
[00:58.44]And you got no one to hold, yeah, yeah
[01:02.33]That's the way you make me feel
[01:04.53]Boy, it's cold
[01:05.95]On the other side, yes I know
[01:08.37]Now it's time to let you go, yeah, yeah

[01:22.36]You know we don't do it that way
[01:25.61]It's been so long
[01:27.33]There's not much to say
[01:30.41]The memory of you and me is gone
[01:32.55]Today is a brand new day
[01:34.75]Ain't it cold
[01:35.97]When the one you love lets you go

[02:00.64]Boy I hope that you can move on
[02:05.77]'Cause you said you'll be fine without me
[02:11.41]But love gets tricky when you're all alone
[02:15.59]Ain't it cold
[02:16.62]When the one you love lets you go
[02:19.27]And you got no one to hold, yeah, yeah
