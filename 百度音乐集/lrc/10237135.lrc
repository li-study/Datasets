[00:00.00]The Cardigans - Live and Learn
[00:29.55]
[00:31.55]I came home in the morning
[00:33.98]And everything was gone
[00:36.06]Oh what have I done
[00:39.37]
[00:40.27]I dropped dead in the hallway
[00:43.19]Cursing the dawn
[00:45.40]Oh come on son
[00:47.68]Why must I burn
[00:51.19]I'm just trying to learn
[00:54.38]
[00:57.69]I stared into the light
[00:59.83]To kill some of my pain
[01:02.47]It was all in vain
[01:04.35]Cause no senses remain
[01:06.71]But an ache in my body
[01:08.99]And regret on my mind
[01:11.51]But I'll be fine
[01:13.06]Cause I live and I learn
[01:17.42]Yes I live and I learn
[01:21.90]If you live you will learn
[01:26.18]I live and I learn
[01:30.37]
[01:41.58]God kicked you in the head
[01:43.58]So I started a fight
[01:46.11]Cause I knew I was right
[01:48.04]But I learned I was wrong
[01:50.48]I remember a slaughter
[01:52.75]I remember I fought
[01:54.82]For the money I brought
[01:56.96]I got blistered and burned
[02:01.58]And lost what I learned
[02:04.08]
[02:05.89]But I live and I learn
[02:09.98]Yes I live and I learn
[02:13.72]
[02:16.79]I got, I got it now
[02:25.41]She's got, She's got it now
[02:30.13]I got, I got it now
[02:38.63]She's got, She's got it now
[02:44.06]
[02:54.69]I came to one a corner
[02:56.99]With some help from a man and goddamn
[03:01.21]I don't see to have learn
[03:03.50]That a lady in need is guilty indeed
[03:08.58]So I paid and got laid in return
[03:14.02]And I don't know what I've learned
[03:17.91]
[03:21.99]Well you get what you give
[03:26.12]And hell yes I lived
[03:30.47]But if you live as you learn
[03:34.29]I don't think I'd be learned
[03:38.62]Oh with the sun in my eyes
[03:42.55]Surprise, I'm living a life
[03:47.84]But I don't seem to learn
[03:51.77]No I don't think I can learn
[03:56.32]
