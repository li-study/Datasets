[00:00.00]Babyface - Sleigh Ride
[00:11.18]Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
[00:13.54]Ring ting tingling too
[00:16.44]Come on, it's lovely weather
[00:18.36]For a sleigh ride together with you
[00:21.54]Outside the snow is falling
[00:23.70]And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
[00:26.70]Come on, it's lovely weather
[00:28.70]For a sleigh ride together with you.
[00:32.85]Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,Let's go,
[00:35.61]Let's look at the snow,
[00:38.21]We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
[00:42.71]Giddy yap, giddy yap, gidd yap,It's grand,
[00:45.74]Just holding your hand,
[00:48.83]We're gliding along with a song
[00:50.55]Of a wintry fairy land
[00:52.38]Our cheeks are nice and rosy
[00:54.67]And comfy cozy are we
[00:57.50]We're snuggled up together
[00:59.70]Like two birds of a feather would be
[01:02.70]Let's take that road before us
[01:04.72]And sing a chorus or two
[01:08.38]Come on, it's lovely weather
[01:10.05]For a sleigh ride together with you.
[01:13.68]There's a birthday party
[01:15.27]At the home of Farmer Gray
[01:18.89]It'll be the perfect ending a of perfect day
[01:24.04]We'll be singing the songs
[01:25.39]We love to sing without a single stop
[01:29.59]At the fireplace while we watch
[01:30.66]The chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop!
[01:34.41]There's a happy feeling
[01:35.95]Nothing in the world can buy
[01:39.48]When they pass around the coffee
[01:41.73]And the pumpkin pie
[01:44.52]It'll nearly be like a picture print
[01:46.39]By Currier and Ives
[01:49.69]These wonderful things are the things
[01:52.52]We remember all through our lives!
[01:59.29]Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
[02:01.43]Ring ting tingling too
[02:03.99]Come on, it's lovely weather
[02:05.95]For a sleigh ride together with you
[02:08.81]Outside the snow is falling
[02:10.90]And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
[02:13.68]Come on, it's lovely weather
[02:15.81]For a sleigh ride together with you.
[02:19.45]Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,Let's go,
[02:22.33]Let's look at the snow,
[02:24.77]We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
[02:29.17]Giddy yap, giddy yap, gidd yap,It's grand,
