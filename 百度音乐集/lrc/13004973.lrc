[00:02.44]
[00:31.20]Gaze upon the stake,
[00:34.16]flames will soon start to embrace
[00:38.18]Condemned, auto da fe,
[00:41.41]she's about to fall from grace
[00:45.47]
[00:46.07]In the land of the rising sun
[00:49.19]shadows are falling again
[00:53.37]The die is cast, the future and past
[00:56.81]coming to her at last
[00:59.29]
[01:00.38]Oh, oh, oh
[01:03.14]All she needed was a Champion
[01:07.72]Oh, oh, oh
[01:10.59]Crying for a saviour to fight for her life
[01:16.35]
[01:29.94]Behold, the freedom cries
[01:33.36]by the dying of the light
[01:37.26]Too late to justify
[01:40.52]for vindication upon this night
[01:44.24]
[01:45.00]In the land of the rising sun
[01:48.41]shadows are falling again
[01:52.29]From out of nowhere, a rider declared
[01:56.07]to answer her final prayer
[01:59.04]
[01:59.56]Oh, oh, oh
[02:02.27]He stood up to be the Champion
[02:06.83]Oh, oh, oh
[02:09.74]He became the saviour that fought for her life
[02:16.46]
[02:32.96]Face to face, eye to eye
[02:36.95]The saviour fought to save her pride
[02:40.42]Far beyond the starlit skies,
[02:44.36]the encounter went on
[02:48.74]
[03:39.71]Gaze upon the stake,
[03:42.59]as the flames start to embrace
[03:46.51]A life, an act of faith,
[03:49.86]long-lost gone without a trace
[03:53.43]
[03:54.32]In the land of the rising sun
[03:57.50]Shadows are falling again
[04:01.68]The die is cast for the future and past
[04:05.12]came for her at last
[04:08.06]
[04:08.72]Oh, oh, oh
[04:11.65]All she needed was a Champion
[04:16.08]Oh, oh, oh
[04:19.02]Crying for a saviour to fight for her
[04:22.94]
[04:23.44]Oh, oh, oh
[04:26.32]He stood up to be the Champion
[04:30.80]Oh, oh, oh
[04:33.78]He became the saviour that fought for her life
[04:40.86]
