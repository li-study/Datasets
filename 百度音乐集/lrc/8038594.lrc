[00:11.79]Wandering Star
[00:12.90]Please could you stay awhile to share my grief
[00:18.77]For its such a lovely day
[00:21.30]To have to always feel this way
[00:24.10]And the time that I will suffer less
[00:30.76]Is when I never have to wake
[00:36.60]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[00:42.74]The blackness of darkness forever
[00:48.03]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[00:54.66]The blackness of darkness forever
[01:00.85]... Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread
[01:06.68]Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
[01:12.07]And the masks, that the monsters wear
[01:19.22]To feed, upon their prey
[01:24.15]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[01:30.38]The blackness of darkness forever
[01:35.92]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[01:42.05]The blackness of darkness forever
[02:24.85](always) doubled up inside
[02:28.55]Take awhile to shed my grief
[02:35.71](always) doubled up inside
[02:41.64]Taunted, cruel.... ...
[02:47.99]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[02:54.84]The blackness of darkness forever
[02:59.99]Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
[03:06.43]The blackness of darkness forever
