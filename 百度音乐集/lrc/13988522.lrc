[00:01.12]Beckah Shae - Hope
[00:03.73]
[00:15.39]And this a song for those who need hope
[00:20.07]For those who can't see it,
[00:22.51]though there's more than enough
[00:25.80]And it's found in His everlasting love
[00:30.49]This is a song for those who feel weak
[00:35.42]For those who can't speak...
[00:37.52]I'll be, the words you need
[00:41.31]Just open your heart and agree
[02:01.13][00:44.51]
[02:02.15][00:45.80]W're all part of a plan
[02:06.11][00:49.27]We've got a purpose
[02:07.96][00:50.97]We've got a destiny
[02:10.89][00:54.04]We're all headed somewhere and we're goin soon
[02:15.15][00:58.41]Cause yeah! We choose to believe
[03:21.43][02:17.60][01:00.80]
[03:39.11][03:23.43][02:33.89][02:18.42][01:16.62][01:01.63]Halleluiah! Raise the banner high
[03:44.43][03:29.09][02:39.06][02:23.91][01:22.37][01:06.88]We're gonna let the whole world know!
[03:47.50][03:33.08][02:42.25][02:26.91][01:25.46][01:10.05]Hosannah! He's comin like fire in the sky
[03:52.28][03:36.92][02:47.02][02:31.67][01:30.25][01:14.93]To take His children home
[01:32.16]
[01:32.76]And this is a song for the broken spirit
[01:36.99]Whose wounds have sealed, yet you still feel it
[01:42.73]The pain is a weapon if you know how to use it
[01:47.82]And this is a song for those who are hated
[01:52.06]For those who have traded all of this world to keep your soul
[01:57.37]You're going through the fire but you're comin out Gold!
[02:49.29]
[02:50.02]And love covers a multitude of sins
[02:53.10]It's why it always wins
[02:55.01]Its mercy never ends
[02:57.00]It's sooner than we think
[02:59.25]We've gotta hold fast
[03:00.70]The confession of our faith
[03:02.49]Cause everything else will all fade away
[03:05.90]While love and justice remains, it'll be okay
[03:10.65]We've just got to believe that we're all a part of the victory
[03:16.05]And we've got a reason to sing!
[03:54.81]
