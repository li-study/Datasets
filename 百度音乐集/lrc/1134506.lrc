[00:02.87]この世の限り
[00:04.87]椎名林檎
[00:06.87]
[00:08.87]この世に限りはあるの?
[00:16.86]もしも果てが見えたなら
[00:23.12]如何やって笑おうか愉しもうか
[00:28.33]もうやり尽くしたね
[00:34.01]
[00:34.39]じゃあ何度だって忘れよう
[00:37.28]そしてまた新しく出逢えれば素晴らしい
[00:45.24]然様なら
[00:47.23]初めまして
[00:49.70]
[00:56.41]But still my dear if the end draws near what should I do?
[01:04.47]If you hold me tight I'd feel all right but still be blue
[01:11.12]But if a song were to play just for us for a moment
[01:16.76]To take the heartache away
[01:19.30]Well then I'd say, I'll make a song for you
[01:25.41]Nothing too old, and nothing too new
[01:30.28]Sing to the light of day
[01:33.20]You'll smile for me, we'll be happy that way
[01:37.42]
[01:38.31]Da la la...
[01:49.66]Just turn away and take this point of view
[01:55.31]Nothing is old, and nothing is new
[02:00.25]When you look at me and say I'll forget you
[02:06.89]
[02:09.76]If you were me who would you be when the sun goes down?
[02:18.85]Two faces bright but I fear the night might come around
[02:25.98]And if reflections appear from the past, all our moments,
[02:31.58]Smiles, love and laughter, I fear
[02:34.07]Well then I'd say, I'll make a song for you
[02:39.95]Nothing too old, and nothing too new
[02:45.04]Sing to the light of day
[02:48.06]You'll smile for me, we'll be happy that way
[02:52.80]
[02:53.47]And take this point of view
[02:56.14]Nothing is old, and nothing is new
[03:00.89]When you look at me and say
[03:03.97]Nice to meet you, would you mind if I stay?
[03:10.76]if I stay
[03:15.77]
