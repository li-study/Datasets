[00:01.12]The Almost - Want To
[00:05.89]
[00:25.34]Truth works just like it needs to
[00:28.16]Sharp, an ugly riding off the lips
[00:31.58]Of someone strange
[00:34.52]Oh, how weird it can be
[00:37.40]Looking at you, looking at me
[00:39.92]I know just what you think
[00:42.48]Yeah, I know just what you think
[02:45.52][01:34.26][00:45.87]
[02:46.57][01:35.60][00:46.17]I can't take this down
[02:51.88][01:41.62][00:51.82]I don't need it
[02:54.49][01:44.24][00:54.44]No, I don't want it
[02:55.93][01:45.77][00:56.02]God, I don't want it
[02:57.44][01:47.29][00:57.39]I want to feel proud
[03:03.43][01:53.17][01:03.71]I won't let them see
[03:06.49][01:55.95][01:06.24]Won't let them see me
[03:07.66][01:57.41][01:07.69]Won't let t hem see me now
[03:11.89][01:12.28]It should be easier
[03:17.71][01:15.45]
[01:15.93]The back of my throat is so dry
[01:18.24]The sick in my chest won't subside
[01:21.23]The ugly that is now is real
[01:24.22]The helplessness of my pain
[01:27.16]Me knowing the weight of my shame
[01:30.15]Can you get me out?
[01:32.25]Yeah come on, get me out
[01:59.18]
[01:59.88]I can't tell how I lie, I can't tell why
[02:10.70]I'm not gonna make it
[02:12.24]Out real clean
[02:13.61]I can't tell when it's real
[02:16.71]I can't tell what I feel
[02:18.27]Maybe this is numb?
[02:20.11]Maybe this is me?
[02:24.81]
[02:28.40]If this is really me, God help me
[02:34.34]To separate fact from fiction
[02:37.16]Separate fact from fiction
[02:40.49]If I am really free, help me
