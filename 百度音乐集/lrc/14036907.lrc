I wanna know where you are
If only you could tell
I wanna know where you are
More than everything you need
Tell me
Will you ever change your mind?
And maybe one day your heart will be mine
One day you'll be mine?
You'll be mine (repeats)
You will be mine
I wanna be in your arms
If only for one day
I wanna be in your arms
It feels so far away from me
Tell me
Will you ever change your mind?
Maybe one day your heart will be mine
One day you'll be mine
You'll be mine (repeats)
You will be mine
