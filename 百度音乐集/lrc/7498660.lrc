[00:33.96]I hear you through the wire
[00:38.04]The words all sound like noise
[00:42.04]What happened to the fire in your voice
[00:49.91]Don't try to hide the distance
[00:54.20]It's just too big to ignore
[00:58.19]We work it out like business
[01:02.38]It won't work anymore.
[00:01.21][01:06.15]I remember eyes that shined
[00:04.39][01:09.74]As they looked so hard back into mine
[00:09.28][01:14.43]Now it's just a memory
[00:12.37][01:17.42]So I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
[01:22.91](I'll) set you free.
[01:35.09]Still sometimes late at night
[01:38.48]Moonlight comes into my window
[01:42.28]I can make believe it's how it used to be
[01:51.06]We made it look so easy
[01:55.45]We never tried to resist
[01:59.14]Somehow you stopped believing
[02:03.23]Somehow we've come to this.
[02:07.22]I remember eyes that shined
[02:10.71]As they looked so hard back into mine
[02:15.20]Now it's just a memory
[02:18.50]So I'll set you free
[02:23.69]I remember words that fell
[02:26.88]Like coins into a wishing well
[02:31.77]It was never meant to be
[02:34.86]So I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
[02:40.25](I'll) set you free.
[02:44.43]So now I must go on
[02:47.52]What more can I do
[02:52.61]What good is being strong
[02:55.70]When all I ever really want is you.
[03:03.85]
[03:20.65]I remember eyes that shined
[03:23.95]As they looked so hard back into mine
[03:28.73]Now it's just a memory
[03:31.83]So I'll set you free
[03:36.82]I remember words that fell
[03:40.21]Like coins into a wishing well
[03:45.10]It was never meant to be
[03:48.21]So I'll set you free (I'll set you free)
[03:53.18](I'll) set you free.
[03:57.47]I remember eyes that shined (I remember)
[04:03.16]As they looked so hard back into mine (all I want is you)
[04:07.30]All I want is you
[04:12.89](I remember) I remember words that fell
[04:16.08]Like coins into a wishing well (all I want is you)
[04:21.65]It's you want that I want
[04:23.45]It's you want but I won't tell, oh
[04:30.03]I remember eyes that shined
[04:33.52]As they looked so hard back into mine (all I want is you)
