[00:14.39]Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
[00:20.95]The Carribean's all booked out
[00:24.37]And that's just as well
[00:27.10]Once I'd have been much keener
[00:29.99]On Barbados or Antigua
[00:33.65]But just now I think the arctic will suit us well
[00:40.77]Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
[00:48.77]
[00:54.82]They've built it all with ice that's pure and clear
[01:01.28]The sofas, the lobby
[01:04.05]Even the chandelier
[01:07.09]A thermostat guarantees A steady minus five degrees
[01:14.18]What other place could serve our needs so well
[01:20.83]Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
[01:34.13]Romantic places
[01:36.85]Like Verona or Paris
[01:40.37]They'll always lead you astray
[01:47.05]You'd have to be a novice
[01:50.42]To ever trust Venice
[01:53.52]And those dreamy waterways
[02:01.79]And what the tropics can do
[02:08.07]I know only too well
[02:13.10]So, let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
[02:29.82]
[02:41.35]Heavy clothing at all times
[02:43.81]Is the expected norm
[02:47.70]Even candlelight at dinner
[02:49.52]
[02:49.74]Is considered too dangerously warm
[02:55.33]And when the time comes for us to sleep
[03:01.74]We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
[03:07.96]And curl up together
[03:09.74]On an ice block carved for two
[03:14.67]But then in the morning
[03:17.12]Provided we've made it through â€¦
[03:22.74]We'll step out together
[03:25.01]To watch the sun rise over
[03:28.29]That vast expanse of cold
[03:35.37]And who knows if we're lucky
[03:38.35]We may find ourselves talking
[03:42.67]Of what our future may hold
[03:50.12]This is no whim of the moment
[03:52.00]I want you to realize
[03:56.34]Let's go away to that palace made of ice
[04:02.59]
[04:04.48]Let's you and me go away to the ice hotel
[04:10.51]The Bahamas are all booked out
[04:14.14]And that's just as well
[04:17.07]I don't think we're quite ready
[04:20.26]For Hawaii of Tahiti
[04:23.85]And when we will be
[04:26.00]Only time will tell
[04:31.05]Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
