[00:03.62]Find Yourself
[00:12.52]Brad Paisley
[00:17.77]When you find yourself
[00:21.69]In some far off place,
[00:26.03]And it causes you
[00:30.54]To rethink some things.
[00:35.00]You start to sense
[00:37.27]That slowly you're becoming someone else
[00:45.23]And then you find yourself.
[00:49.85]When you make new friends
[00:53.89]In a brand new town,
[00:58.30]And you start to think
[01:02.59]About settling down,
[01:07.08]The things that would have been lost on you
[01:11.36]Are now clear as a bell.
[01:17.52]And you find yourself
[01:21.45]That's when you find yourself.
[01:26.29]Well you go through life
[01:30.58]So sure of where you're heading,
[01:35.00]And you wind up lost
[01:39.10]And it's the best thing that could happen.
[01:43.86]because sometimes when you lose your way
[01:48.11]It's really just as well.
[01:54.13]because you find yourself;
[01:57.95]That when you find yourself.
[02:28.52]When you meet the one
[02:32.77]You're been waiting for,
[02:37.79]And she's everything
[02:41.64]That you want and more,
[02:46.53]You look at her
[02:48.02]And you finally start
[02:50.26]To live for someone else.
[02:56.71]And then you find yourself;
[03:00.73]That's when you find yourself.
[03:05.55]We go though life
[03:09.47]So sure of where we're heading,
[03:13.75]And then we wind up lost
[03:18.12]And it's the best thing that could happen.
[03:23.01]Sometimes when you lose your way
[03:26.61]It's really just as well.
[03:33.02]Because you find yourself;
[03:36.60]Yeah that's when you find yourself.
