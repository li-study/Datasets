[00:12.50]If you can depend
[00:16.77]On certainty
[00:21.17]Count it out and weigh it up again
[00:25.94]You can be sure
[00:29.66]You've reached the end
[00:33.16]And still you don't feel
[00:36.96]Do you know you're beautiful
[00:43.39]Do you know you're beautiful
[00:49.81]Do you know you're beautiful
[00:55.91]You are  yes you are  yes you are
[01:04.66]If you can ignore
[01:08.58]What you've become
[01:12.78]Take it out and see it die again
[01:17.66]You can be here
[01:21.38]So who's a friend
[01:25.00]And still you don't feel
