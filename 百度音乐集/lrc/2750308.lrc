[00:18.29]Trudging slowly over wet sand
[00:22.36]Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
[00:31.90]This is the coastal town
[00:36.77]That they forgot to close down
[00:40.56]Armageddon - come armageddon!
[00:43.49]Come, armageddon! come!
[00:46.58]
[00:49.55]Everyday is like sunday
[00:56.71]Everyday is silent and grey
[01:04.34]
[01:06.07]Hide on the promenade
[01:09.68]Etch a postcard :
[01:13.35]\"how i dearly wish i was not here\"
[01:21.35]In the seaside town
[01:25.63]...that they forgot to bomb
[01:29.89]Come, come, come - nuclear bomb
[01:35.40]
[01:38.93]Everyday is like sunday
[01:47.05]Everyday is silent and grey
[01:52.26]
[01:54.70]Trudging back over pebbles and sand
[02:01.03]And a strange dust lands on your hands
[02:09.08](and on your face...)
[02:13.59](on your face ...)
[02:18.69](on your face ...)
[02:21.32](on your face ...)
[02:26.82]
[02:28.20]Everyday is like sunday
[02:36.32]\"win yourself a cheap tray\"
[02:44.62]Share some greased tea with me
[02:53.33]Everyday is silent and grey
