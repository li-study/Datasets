[00:35.30]Well, she's walking through the clouds
[00:42.32]With a circus mind,
[00:45.57]That's running wild.
[00:49.84]Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
[00:55.66]And fairytales,
[00:58.57]
[00:59.04]That's all she ever thinks about .
[01:01.04]
[01:01.64]Riding with the wind.
[01:03.48]
[01:07.72]When I'm sad, she comes to me
[01:15.46]With a thousand smiles
[01:18.45]She gives to me free.
[01:20.33]
[01:22.38]It's alright, she says,
[01:24.78]It's alright;
[01:28.40]Take anything you want from me,
[01:31.10]Anything.
[01:32.75]
[01:44.74]Fly on, little wing.
