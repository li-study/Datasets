[00:08.43]Ooh baby love, my baby love
[00:14.49]I need you, oh how I need you
[00:18.86]But all you do is treat me bad
[00:22.36]Break my heart and leave me sad
[00:25.73]Tell me, what did I do wrong
[00:29.32]To make you stay away so long
[00:32.77]
[00:33.06]'Cause baby love, my baby love
[00:36.24]Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
[00:40.32]Instead of breaking up
[00:43.84]Let's do some kissing and making up
[00:47.20]Don't throw our love away
[00:50.78]In my arms why don't you stay
[00:54.32]Need ya, need ya
[00:56.04]Baby love, ooh, baby love
[01:01.08]
[01:15.64]Baby love, my baby love
[01:18.82]Why must we seperate, my love
[01:23.24]All of my whole life through
[01:26.66]I never loved no one but you
[01:30.10]Why you do me like you do
[01:33.56]I get this need
[01:34.99]
[01:35.35]Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
[01:41.76]Once again, my love
[01:44.09]Feel your warm embrace, my love
[01:48.01]Don't throw our love away
[01:50.98]
[01:51.70]Please don't do me this way
[01:55.04]Not happy like I used to be
[01:58.44]Loneliness has got the best of me
[02:02.18]My love, my baby love
[02:05.11]
[02:05.81]I need you, oh how I need you
[02:09.76]Why you do me like you do
[02:13.45]After I've been true to you
[02:16.91]So deep in love with you
[02:20.29]
[02:20.55]Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
[02:25.45]'Til it's hurtin' me
[02:27.55]Ooh, baby love
[02:31.79]Don't throw our love away
[02:35.24]Don't throw our love away
