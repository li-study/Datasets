[00:05.00]Where did Ur heart go-Wham （威猛）
[00:15.00]
[00:22.46]I spend my nights down on the wharf
[00:27.39]In unlit alleyways
[00:32.59]By the church downtown
[00:37.80]Where Sally prays
[00:42.14]Come down sometime
[00:44.75]We'll share a rusty can of corn...
[00:52.36]And listen to the radio
[00:56.07]I love you, I love you, it says...
[01:21.53][01:01.64]Where did your heart go
[01:26.71][01:06.93]Did you put it on a train
[01:31.77][01:11.85]Did you leave it in the rain
[01:35.86][01:16.79]Or down in Mexico
[01:45.71]
[02:04.24]You cry, but I don't know
[02:09.12]I've heard it all before
[02:14.32]There it goes again,
[02:19.38]the slamming of the door
[02:24.12]Sometimes the river calls me
[02:28.93]And at night it calls my name
[02:34.01]Says "put your troubles down beside me"
[02:38.75]Things have always been the same...
