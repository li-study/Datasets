[00:01.29]The Bridges - All The Words
[00:07.69]
[00:15.39]All the words that you said
[00:16.88]Made you matter in my head
[00:18.91]I was tied to the thought of you
[00:22.11]
[00:22.33]Taken back to the day
[00:24.08]That I found you on my way
[00:26.03]To a place I was going to
[00:29.22]
[00:29.42]Simplify all these years
[00:31.26]And another round of tears
[00:33.11]I'm so lost when it comes to you
[00:36.18]
[00:36.69]Broken in and again
[00:38.39]Now you're everywhere I've been
[00:40.27]So it's hard to deny the view
[00:43.74]
[00:44.12]Did you know I had you going?
[00:48.24]You got your heart back
[00:50.04]It was stolen
[00:51.90]And now there's nothing I can do at all
[00:58.18]
[00:58.37]And it's still there, all the love we had
[01:02.49]And it's all right
[01:03.56]Keep the memories tied to your heart, dear
[01:06.98]And the words will be enough
[01:15.22]
[01:15.69]All the words that you say
[01:17.31]Have me loving you away
[01:19.43]And my heart's all I want to see
[01:22.56]
[01:22.76]Let me know you believe
[01:24.50]That the world is meant to leave
[01:26.44]And you're here to belong to me
[01:29.67]
[01:30.12]Did you know I have you going?
[01:34.28]I got your heart back
[01:36.05]It was stolen
[01:38.05]And now there's nothing you can do at all
[01:44.08]
[01:44.28]And it's still there, all the love we had
[01:48.12]And it's all right
[01:49.55]Keep the memories tied to your heart, dear
[01:53.07]And the words will be enough
[02:01.41]
[02:17.64]It's you against the sunlight always
[02:24.95]It's you against the sunlight always
[02:32.28]It's you against your word always
[02:39.32]I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
[03:05.95][02:51.18]
[03:06.19][02:51.41]And it's still there, all the love we had
[03:09.49][02:55.24]And it's all right
[03:10.85][02:56.71]Keep the memories tied to your heart, dear
[03:14.50][03:00.33]And the words will be enough
[03:22.56]
[03:24.50]Always, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
[03:31.71]Always, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
[03:44.47]
