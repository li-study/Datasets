[00:15.95]Wave away my yesterday
[00:19.47]Cause I'm leaving it behind me.
[00:24.11]Hello sunshine, come what may.
[00:27.75]I feel something new inside me.
[00:32.27]I hear the birds singing
[00:34.31]Now my alarm's ringing
[01:24.26][00:36.26]Get up, get up, hey!

[02:52.68][02:37.05][01:32.72][00:44.63]I'm stepping, stepping on my way
[02:55.60][02:39.39][01:35.64][00:47.76]Good morning,

[01:04.00]Slow down, breathe in,
[01:06.21]Don't move ahead
[01:07.44]I'm just living in this moment
[01:10.97]I've got my arms raised, un-phased
[01:14.27]Jump out of bed
[01:15.70]Gotta get this party going
[01:20.34]I went to bed dreaming,
[01:22.34]You woke me up singing
[01:39.91]And I can feel the hope that's rising up in me.
[01:51.97]Now I'm smiling, and I'm kissing all my worries goodbye
[01:56.44]Got the feeling, if I spread my wings I might even fly
[02:00.52]You are my truth, my way
[02:02.34]Give me the strength to say
[02:04.06]Get up, get up, get up
