[00:10.00]
[00:15.40]I wanna have you
[00:17.28]'Cause you're all I've got
[00:22.24]Don't wanna lose you
[00:24.28]'Cause it means a lot
[00:28.46]All the joy this world can bring
[00:32.10]Doesn't give me anything
[00:35.24]When you're not here
[00:39.32]
[00:43.23]Idiot me
[00:46.37]Stupid fool
[00:49.90]How could you be
[00:53.48]So uncool?
[00:56.84]To fall in love with someone who
[01:00.58]Doesn't really care for you
[01:03.78]It's so obscure...
[01:10.46]But I feel...
[01:18.27]WONDERFUL
[01:24.77]Yes I feel...
[01:28.64]Don't you know I feel...
[01:33.48]WONDERFUL
[01:38.39]
[01:39.36]Come on
[03:43.48][03:13.65][01:40.17]God it makes me feel so blue
[03:46.20][03:17.20][01:43.81]Everytime I think about you
[03:49.87][03:20.73][01:47.41]All of the heat of my desire
[03:53.40][03:24.47][01:51.05]Smokin' like some crazy fire
[03:56.98][03:28.07][01:54.64]Come on here
[03:57.86][03:28.96][01:55.51]Look at me
[03:58.80][03:29.90][01:56.45]Where I stand
[04:00.56][03:31.66][01:58.16]Can't you see my heart burnin'
[04:02.32][03:33.37][01:59.98]In my hands?
[04:04.20][03:35.18][02:01.74]Do you want me?
[04:05.91][03:37.00][02:03.56]Do you not?
[04:07.78][03:38.88][02:05.38]Does it feel cold baby?
[04:09.66][03:40.69][02:07.31]Does it feel hot?
[04:11.53][03:42.57][02:09.40]
[02:17.36]I wanna hold you
[02:19.57]And be so held back
[02:24.36]Don't wanna need you
[02:26.51]But it's where I'm at
[02:30.59]Thinkin' 'bout you every day
[02:34.28]How come I was made that way?
[02:38.41]It's so surreal...
[02:44.03]But I feel...
[02:52.13]WONDERFUL
[02:58.30]Yes I feel...
[03:02.19]Don't you know I feel...
[03:06.99]WONDERFUL
