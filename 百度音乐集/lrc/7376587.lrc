[00:15.58]it's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
[00:26.53]without saying a word you can light up the dark
[00:37.24]try as i may i can never explain
[00:41.92]
[00:43.30]what i hear when you don't say a thing
[00:51.63]
[00:52.54]the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[00:58.01]there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[01:03.54]the tough of your hand says you'll catch me wherever i fall
[01:14.80]you say it best when you say nothing at all
[01:22.75]
[01:31.77]all day long i can hear people talking out loud
[01:42.51]but when you hold me near you drown the crowd
[01:52.96]try as they may they can never define
[01:58.45]what's been said between your heart and mine
[02:04.99]the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[02:10.57]there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[02:15.89]the tough of your hand says you'll catch me wherever i fall
[02:27.40]you say it best when you say nothing at all
[02:38.95]
[02:53.82]the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[02:59.11]there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
