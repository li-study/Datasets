[00:14.00]In my solitude
[00:23.00]You haunt me
[00:31.00]With dreadful ease
[00:37.00]Of days gone by
[00:45.00]In my solitude
[00:52.00]You taunt me
[01:01.00]With memories
[01:07.00]That never die
[02:15.00][01:15.00]I sit in my chair
[02:20.00][01:20.00]And filled with despair
[02:25.00][01:24.00]There's no one could be so sad
[02:32.00][01:31.00]With gloom everywhere
[02:36.00][01:35.00]I sit and I stare
[02:40.00][01:39.00]I know that I'll soon go mad
[02:45.00][01:45.00]In my solitude
[02:52.00][01:52.00]I'm afraid
[03:00.00][02:00.00]Dear Lord above
[03:07.00][02:06.00]Send back my love
