[04:17.17][03:58.20][03:22.81][03:02.92][02:40.27][01:29.23][00:52.18][00:17.15]
[00:19.15]He drowns in his dreams
[00:23.25]An exquisite extreme, I know
[00:27.57]He's as damned as he seems
[00:31.75]And more heaven than a heart could hold
[00:36.73]And if I tried to save it
[00:41.22]My heart wall could cave in
[00:45.79]It just ain't right, it just ain't right
[03:27.40][00:53.71]Oh and I don't know
[03:31.63][00:57.99]Don't know what he's after
[03:36.90][02:14.31][01:02.97]But he's so beautiful
[03:40.51][02:17.82][01:06.41]Such a beautiful disaster
[03:44.90][02:23.08][01:11.54]And if I could hold on
[03:49.22][02:26.91][01:15.55]Through the tears and the laughter
[03:54.27][02:32.20][01:20.80]Would it be beautiful
[03:57.72][02:35.55][01:24.14]Or just a beautiful disaster?
[01:30.34]He's magic and myth
[01:34.77]As strong as what I believe
[01:39.38]A tragedy with
[01:43.51]For damage that a soul should see
[01:47.89]And do I try to change him?
[01:52.66]So hard not to blame him
[01:57.18]Hold on tight, hold on tight
[02:05.12]Oh and I don't know...
[02:09.59]I don't know what he's after
[02:41.72]I'm looking for love and the logical
[02:46.25]But he's only happy hysterical
[02:50.62]I'm waiting for some kind of miracle
[02:54.18]Waiting so long,
[02:59.16]I've waited So long
[03:04.15]He's soft to the touch
[03:08.38]But frayed at the end he breaks
[03:12.91]He's never enough
[03:17.47]And still he's more than I can take
[04:11.16][04:02.55]He's beautiful
[04:06.92]Lord he's so beautiful
