[00:28.84]It seems so long
[00:31.83]Since we last met
[00:34.87]How has it gone
[00:36.81]Don't accept the blame
[00:41.39]I would
[00:42.33]I would not complain
[00:47.55]
[00:48.53]Cause I'm sure it wasn't your own fault
[00:51.59]That you never made it out your fall
[00:54.59]Just lock the door and find some time to scream
[00:58.99]To scream again
[01:02.51]
[01:05.91]Just say when
[01:09.29]And you'll stop the pain
[01:12.09]Of your life
[01:14.93]Bring it to an end
[01:17.81]Just say when
[01:21.09]And you can make amends
[01:23.86]Just say hello
[01:27.25]Say hello again
[01:31.65]
[01:32.49]Hello again
[01:35.21]It's not that hard
[01:38.41]No dead ends
[01:41.28]Even with the scares
[01:43.31]Don't accept the blame
[01:47.65]I would
[01:48.96]I would not complain
[01:54.17]
[01:55.16]Cause I'm sure it wasn't your own fault
[01:58.17]That you never made it out your fall
[02:01.17]Just lock the door
[02:02.68]Find some time to scream
[02:05.47]
[02:06.88]Just say when
[02:09.60]And you'll stop the pain
[02:12.49]Of your life
[02:15.80]Bring it to end
[02:18.42]Just say when
[02:21.76]And you could make amends
[02:24.56]Just say hello
[02:27.89]Say hello again
[02:34.24]
[02:43.72]You have no home
[02:45.00]You've lost your throne
[02:46.52]Where has it gone
[02:48.35]Well, it could come back
[02:50.76]But you're being there
[02:52.43]By the walking dead
[02:54.34]Stumble as you crack the ground
[02:58.08]You'll be down
[03:01.00]
[03:01.64]Just say when
[03:06.74]You could stop the pain
[03:12.20]
[03:12.48]Just say when
[03:15.62]And you could make amends
[03:18.56]Just say hello
[03:21.78]Say hello again
[03:26.05](Hello again)
[03:26.79](Hello again)
[03:28.16](Hello again)
[03:29.52](Hello again)
[03:31.17]It's not the end if you just say hello again...

[03:41.76]The End
