[00:06.13]Nelly Furtado - I'm like a bird
[00:21.75]You're beautiful, that's for sure
[00:26.73]You'll never ever fade
[00:32.17]You're lovely but it's not for sure
[00:37.38]That I won't ever change
[00:42.36]And though my love is rare
[00:47.41]Though my love is true
[00:53.76]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[00:58.07]I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is
[01:02.85](and baby all I need for you to know is)
[01:04.41]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[01:08.72]I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
[01:13.56]All I need for you to know is
[01:15.16]Your faith in me brings me to tears
[01:20.92]Even after all these years
[01:25.44]And it pains me so much to tell
[01:30.91]That you don't know me that well
[01:35.89]And though my love is rare
[01:41.17]Though my love is true
[01:47.34]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[01:51.80]I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is
[01:56.81](and baby all I need for you to know is)
[01:58.32]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[02:02.59]I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
[02:07.81]Baby all I need you to know is
[02:09.69]It's not that I wanna say goodbye
[02:12.12]It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
[02:19.81]Each and every single day I know
[02:22.72]I'm going to have to eventually give you away
[02:32.08]And though my love is rare
[02:37.46]And though my love is true
[02:42.85]Hey I'm just scared
[02:48.05]That we may fall through
[02:57.20]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[03:01.34]I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is
[03:06.39](and baby all I need for you to know is)
[03:07.88]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[03:12.09]I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
[03:17.21]All I need for you to know is
[03:18.49]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[03:22.84]I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is
[03:27.79](and baby all I need for you to know is)
[03:29.20]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
[03:33.41]I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is
[03:38.50]All I need for you to know is
[03:39.88]I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
