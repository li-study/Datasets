[00:30.33]Pressure
[00:31.94]Pushing down on me
[00:33.96]Pressing down on you
[00:35.98]No man ask for
[00:38.33]Under pressure
[00:40.37]That burns a building down
[00:42.56]Splits a family in two
[00:44.71]Puts people on streets
[00:55.54]It's the terror of knowing
[00:57.68]What this world is about
[01:00.16]Watching some good friends
[01:01.98]Screaming let me out!
[01:04.33]Pray tomorrow takes me higher
[01:08.37]Pressure on people
[01:10.44]People on streets
[01:18.72]O-kay
[01:22.04]Chippin' around
[01:24.16]Kick my brains round the floor
[01:26.34]These are the days
[01:28.09]It never rains but it pours
[01:38.11]People on streets
[01:42.33]People on streets
[01:46.48]It's the terror of knowing
[01:48.46]What this world is about
[01:50.98]Watching some good friends
[01:52.81]Screaming let me out!
[01:55.07]Pray tomorrow takes me higher higher higher
[01:59.63]Pressure on people
[02:01.15]People on streets
[02:05.77]Turned away from it all
[02:07.84]Like a blind man
[02:10.73]Sat on a fence but it don't work
[02:14.59]Keep coming up with love
[02:16.35]But it's so slashed and torn
[02:18.54]Why why why?
[02:29.47]Love love love love
[02:33.44]Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
[02:37.03]Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
[02:40.87]Why can't we give love that one more chance?
[02:45.35]Why can't we give love give love give love?...
[02:54.17]Cause love's such an old fashioned word
[02:59.23]And love dares you to care
[03:03.51]For people on the edge of the night
[03:09.85]And love dares you to change our way
[03:14.58]Of caring about ourselves
[03:19.25]This is our last dance
[03:23.52]This is our last dance
[03:27.74]This is ourselves
[03:31.69]under pressure
[03:35.81]Under pressure
[03:40.32]Pressure
