[00:17.62]See them walking hand in hand
[00:19.39]Across the bridge at midnight
[00:24.95]Heads turning as the lights flashing out
[00:27.16]Are so bright
[00:31.58]And walk right out to the four line track
[00:33.51]There's a camera rolling on her back
[00:36.53]On her back
[00:38.88]And I sense a rhythm humming in a frenzy
[00:41.15]All the way down her spine

[01:10.83]Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling

[01:27.27]Cause the crowd all love pulling Dolly by the hair
[01:30.28]By the hair
[01:32.31]And she wonders how she ever got here
[01:34.55]As she goes under again
