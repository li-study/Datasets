[02:08.21][00:00.93]Lonestar where are you out tonight?
[02:18.60][00:11.24]This feeling I'm trying to fight
[02:29.71][00:21.80]It's dark and I think that
[02:34.58][00:27.17]I would give anything
[02:50.26][02:40.03][00:32.52]For you to shine down on me
[00:40.58]
[00:43.48]How far you are I just don't know
[00:53.94]The distance I'm willing to go
[01:05.31]I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky
[01:15.33]Hoping for some kind of sign
