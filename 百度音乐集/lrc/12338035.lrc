[00:19.25]
[01:22.97]The job is done and I go out
[01:27.72]Another boring day
[01:32.45]I leave it all behind me now
[01:37.57]So many worlds away
[01:40.74]
[02:01.59]I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
[02:06.46]And all we gonna do
[02:11.32]Is walk around to catch the thrill
[02:16.09]On streets we call the zoo
[02:19.65]
[02:20.95]We eat the night, we drink the time
[02:25.84]Make our dreams come true
[02:30.59]And hungry eyes are passing by
[02:35.36]On streets we call the zoo
[02:39.52]
[02:40.43]We eat the night, we drink the time
[02:45.10]Make our dreams come true
[02:49.82]And hungry eyes are passing by
[02:55.07]On streets we call the zoo
[03:04.53]
[03:50.37]And walk down 42nd Street
[03:44.87]You wanna be excited too
[03:55.19]And you will feel the heat
[03:58.62]We eat the night, we drink the time
[04:03.48]Make our dreams come true
[04:08.48]And hungry eyes are passing by
[04:13.23]On streets we call the zoo
[04:16.29]
[04:17.99]We eat the night, we drink the time
[04:22.72]Make our dreams come true
[04:27.52]And hungry eyes are passing by
[04:32.71]On streets we call the zoo
