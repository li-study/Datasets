[00:00.94]The Beatles--Rock And Roll Music
[00:01.17]
[00:01.69]Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
[00:05.49]Any old way you choose it
[00:08.00]It\'s got a back beat, you can\'t lose it
[00:11.16]Any old time you use it
[00:14.04]It\'s gotta be rock and roll music
[00:17.04]If you wanna dance with me
[00:19.96]If you wanna dance with me
[00:21.72]
[00:22.55]I\'ve got no kick against modern jazz
[00:24.68]Unless they try to play it too darn fast
[00:27.60]And lose the beauty of the melody
[00:30.51]Until they sound just like a symphony
[00:31.47]
[00:33.60]That\'s why I go for that that rock and roll music
[00:37.47]Any old way you choose it
[00:40.24]It\'s got a back beat, you can\'t lose it
[00:43.27]Any old time you use it
[00:46.10]It\'s gotta be rock and roll music
[00:49.03]If you wanna dance with me
[00:51.97]If you wanna dance with me
[00:54.07]
[00:54.53]I took my loved one over across the tracks
[00:57.03]So she can hear my man awail a sax
[00:59.53]I must admit they have a rocking band
[01:02.38]Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
[01:03.46]
[01:05.27]That\'s why I go for that that rock and roll music
[01:09.23]Any old way you choose it
[01:11.82]It\'s got a back beat, you can\'t lose it
[01:14.93]Any old time you use it
[01:17.59]It\'s gotta be rock and roll music
[01:20.71]If you wanna dance with me
[01:23.62]If you wanna dance with me
[01:25.06]
[01:25.59]Way down South they had a jubilee
[01:28.38]The jokey folks they had a jamboree
[01:31.22]They\'re drinking home brew from a water cup
[01:33.98]The folks dancing there are all shook up
[01:36.63]
[01:37.06]And started playing that that rock and roll music
[01:40.70]Any old time you use it
[01:43.33]It\'s got a back beat, you can\'t lose it
[01:46.46]Any old time you use it
[01:49.34]It\'s gotta be rock and roll music
[01:52.22]If you wanna dance with me
[01:55.15]If you wanna dance with me
[01:56.59]
[01:57.11]Don\'t care to hear them play a tango
[01:59.91]And In The Mood they take a mambo
[02:02.95]It\'s way to early for a congo
[02:05.48]So keep a rocking that piano
[02:08.17]
[02:08.62]That\'s why I go for that that rock and roll music
[02:12.33]Any old time you use it
[02:14.95]It\'s got a back beat, you can\'t lose it
[02:18.02]Any old time you use it
[02:20.94]Gotta be rock and roll music
[02:23.98]If you wanna dance with me
[02:26.79]If you wanna dance with me
