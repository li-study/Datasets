[00:16.72]I still remember the day that we met
[00:20.53]I hold on to every word you said
[00:24.57]Asked me to surrender
[00:26.68]And that's what I did
[00:28.72]And you broke my heart again and again
[00:32.10]
[00:32.82]So now you are sorry like your all in love
[00:36.86]But where was your sorry when you broke it all up
[00:40.50]
[00:41.50]I told myself never again
[00:43.74]There ain't no way I'm lettin you in
[00:45.69]Because I keep on remembering when you played me
[00:49.22]I cried me a river,
[00:51.38]I cried me a sea,
[00:53.36]I cried me an ocean
[00:55.37]I cried me a stream,
[00:57.40]I'm fresh outta teardrops
[00:59.53]You've got me on E
[01:01.53]I'm outta emotion got nothin in me,
[01:05.53]And I would have done anything in the world for you
[01:10.03]I would have done anything that you told me too,
[01:13.89]I cried me a river,
[01:15.97]I cried me a sea
[01:18.01]And I ain't got nothin left in me...
[01:21.65]
[01:22.18]You can't have my number
[01:24.15]Don't wanna be friends
[01:26.23]I don't care to see you now and then
[01:30.25]It's not that I'm bitter
[01:32.31]It's just that I'm done
[01:34.27]My heart finally said enough is enough
[01:37.80]
[01:38.41]So now you are sorry like your all in love
[01:42.54]But where was your sorry when you broke it all up
[01:46.25]

[02:27.52]
[02:29.51]Just in case your not clear
[02:33.84]And you think there's a chance
[02:37.96]There's no way you're gettin' near
[02:41.92]This or have me again
