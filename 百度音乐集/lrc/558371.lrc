[00:03.74]SWIMMING IN MIAMI
[00:08.32]
[00:09.22]I’m alone above the atmosphere
[00:12.38]And no one looking up can find me here
[00:15.70]Cuz I can close my eyes and disappear
[00:22.66]When I climb the stairs to watch the sun
[00:25.92]Above the station walls, the colors run
[00:30.02]To fill the swimming pool when I am done
[00:32.73]
[00:36.86]I am the captain of an oil tanker
[00:40.10]That travels through your veins
[00:42.48]
[00:43.98]When the satellites hang all around
[00:50.19]And I can finally hear the lovely sound
[00:54.65]When all the engines in the back room die down
[00:59.30]All the airships move across the sky
[01:01.84]And my equipment just keeps standing by
[01:05.58]The planets glow and intensify
[01:09.06]
[01:12.06]I am the pilot of a cargo airplane
[01:16.04]That travels through your veins
[01:18.99]
[01:20.08]When you are lying half asleep in your room
[01:26.43]Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon
[01:33.33]Because the water doesn’t flood the stairwell
[01:40.99]It could be raining but then you can never tell
[01:47.71]If you’re alone in this awful downpour
[01:55.34]Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door
[02:00.28]
[02:05.64]In the evening light, the boulevard
[02:13.24]Conceals the night with dis-regard
[02:14.00]For all the workers in a West Coast shipyard
[02:19.93]When I rearrange the silverware
[02:24.03]And reinstall the lights and captain’s chair
[02:28.48]I’ll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air
[02:32.29]
[02:34.32]I am the engineer of 40 freight trains
[02:37.33]That travel through your veins
[02:40.08]
[02:41.27]When you are lying half asleep in your room
[02:48.12]Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon
[02:55.28]Because the water doesn’t flood the stairwell
[03:02.25]It could be raining but then you can never tell
[03:09.66]If you’re awake in this awful downpour
[03:17.84]Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door
[03:24.35]When you are swimming in Miami at night
[03:31.23]I’m all around you in the traffic and city light
