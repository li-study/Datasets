[00:33.85]They lived in peace, not long ago
[00:38.25]A mighty Indian tribe
[00:42.50]But the winds of change,
[00:44.63]Made them realize, that the promises were lies.
[00:49.65]
[00:51.14]The white man's greed, in search of gold

[02:06.93]Nowhere they could turn
[02:11.67]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
[02:20.16]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
[03:25.15]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
[03:33.63]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
[03:42.42]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
[03:50.97]Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.
