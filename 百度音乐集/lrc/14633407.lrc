[00:00.07]Journey

[00:11.22]
[00:12.41]It's a long long journey
[00:17.79]Till I know where I'm supposed to be
[00:24.10]It's a long long journey
[00:29.77]And I don't know if I can believe
[00:36.13]When shadows fall and block my eyes
[00:41.36]I am lost and know that I must hide
[00:48.04]It's a long long journey
[00:53.19]Till I find my way home to you
[00:58.61]
[01:00.19]Many days I've spent
[01:05.03]Drifting on through empty shores
[01:11.06]Wondering what's my purpose
[01:16.73]Wondering how to make me strong
[01:21.38]
[01:22.56]I know I will falter I know I will cry
[01:28.41]I know you'll be standing by my side
[01:34.61]It's a long long journey
[01:40.09]And I need to be close to you
[01:45.40]
[01:46.88]Sometimes it feels no one understands
[01:52.66]I don't even know why
[01:55.81]I do the things I do
[01:59.00]When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul
[02:05.34]Will you break down these walls and pull me through
[02:16.41]
[02:18.73]Cause It's a long long journey
[02:25.80]Till I feel that I am worth the price
[02:31.60]You paid for me on calvary
[02:37.74]Beneath those stormy skies
[02:43.44]
[02:43.85]When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes
[02:49.63]It feel like everything is out to make me lose control
[02:58.91]Cause It's a long long journey
[03:07.16]Till I find my way home to you
[03:16.58]oh to you
[03:23.94]
