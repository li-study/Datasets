[00:29.43]Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
[00:35.00]They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
[00:41.73]Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
[00:47.36]Possessing and caressing me.
[00:51.91]Jai guru de va om
[01:12.57][01:00.77]Nothing's gonna change my world,
[01:18.27][01:06.53]Nothing's gonna change my world.
[01:22.52][01:10.53]
[01:24.13]Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
[01:30.24]That call me on and on across the universe,
[01:35.56]Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
[01:41.26]Tumble blindly as they make their way
[01:44.71]Across the universe
[01:47.67]Jai guru de va om
[02:08.00][01:56.46]Nothing's gonna change my world,
[02:13.61][02:02.19]Nothing's gonna change my world.
[02:18.02][02:06.38]
[02:19.39]Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
[02:23.42]Through my open views inviting and inciting me
[02:29.46]Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
[02:34.31]Million suns, it calls me on and on
[02:37.49]Across the universe
[02:40.65]Jai guru de va om
[03:01.16][02:49.33]Nothing's gonna change my world,
[03:06.79][02:54.97]Nothing's gonna change my world.
[03:09.80][02:59.82]
[03:12.63]Jai guru de va
