[00:-2.00]Daughtry - September
[00:-1.00]

[00:15.00]
[00:16.60]How the time passed away
[00:19.66]All the trouble that we gave
[00:23.05]And all those days we spent out by the lake
[00:27.09]
[00:29.41]Has it all gone to waste?
[00:32.48]All the promises we made,
[00:35.83]One by one they vanish just the same.
[00:39.82]
[00:43.32]Of all the things I still remember
[00:46.56]Summer's never looked the same
[00:49.72]The years go by and time just seems to fly by
[00:53.45]But the memories remain.
[00:55.45]
[00:56.20]In the middle of September
[00:59.43]We'd still play out in the rain
[01:02.46]Nothing to lose but everything to gain
[01:09.07]Reflecting now on how things could've been
[01:12.59]It was worth it in the end
[01:16.93]
[01:20.54]Now it all seems so clear,
[01:23.66]There's nothing left to fear
[01:26.76]So we made our way by finding what was real
[01:31.08]
[01:33.23]Now the days are so long
[01:36.29]That summer's moving on
[01:39.70]We reach for something that's already gone yeah
[01:46.13]
[01:47.26]Of all the things I remember
[01:50.52]Summer's never looked the same
[01:53.58]The year's go by and time just seems to fly by
[01:57.40]But the memories remain.
[01:59.36]
[02:00.18]In the middle of September
[02:03.34]We'd still play out in the rain
[02:06.44]Nothing to lose but everything to gain
[02:12.50]Reflecting now on how things could've been
[02:16.60]It was worth it in the end
[02:19.36]
[02:32.24]We knew we had to leave this town
[02:36.36]But we never knew when we never knew how
[02:40.61]We would end up here the way we are
[02:44.98]Yeah we knew we had to leave this town
[02:48.77]But we never knew when and we never knew how
[02:56.50]
[02:57.77]Of all the things I still remember
[03:01.03]Summer's never looked the same
[03:04.03]The years go by and time just seems to fly by
[03:07.77]But the memories remain.
[03:09.82]
[03:10.57]In the middle of September
[03:13.84]We'd still play out in the rain
[03:16.90]Nothing to lose but everything to gain
[03:23.28]Reflecting now on how things could've been
[03:27.04]It was worth it in the end
[03:31.83]
