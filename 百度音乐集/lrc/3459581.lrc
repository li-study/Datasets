[01:00.90]The journey home is never too long
[01:08.20]Your heart arrives before the train
[01:15.94]The journey home is never too long
[01:23.38]Some yesterdays always remain
[01:29.47]
[01:30.83]I'm going back to where my heart was light
[01:38.61]When my pillow was a ship, I sailed through the night
[01:46.75]
[01:47.14]Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah, ...
[02:16.34]
[02:16.80]The journey home is never too long
[02:24.11]When open arms are waiting there
[02:31.71]The journey home is never too long
[02:39.43]There's room to love and room to spare
[02:45.18]
[02:46.71]I want to feel the way that I did then
[02:54.51]And think my wishes through before I wish again
[03:02.62]
[03:03.11]Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah, ...
[03:16.78]
[03:17.71]Not every boat you come across is one you have to take
[03:24.73]Now sometimes standing still can be
[03:28.26]the best move you ever make
[03:37.04]
[03:47.85]The journey home is never too long
[03:55.07]Home hopes to heal the deepest pain
[04:02.73]The journey home is never too long
[04:10.27]Your heart arrives before the train
[04:23.07]
