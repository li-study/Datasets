[00:08.27]If You Love Me
[00:10.68]by Ronan Keating
[00:13.03]
[00:19.22]Wish I could tell by
[00:21.21]The look in your eyes
[00:22.73](Were I stand)
[00:23.71]Wish I could tell
[00:25.31]What you're feeling inside
[00:26.76](But I can't)
[00:28.18]Wish you would say what
[00:29.81]I'm needing to hear
[00:31.30](You want me)
[00:32.50]Give me a sign that
[00:34.13]Would make it all clear
[00:35.69](Just show me)
[00:36.93]Don't leave my heart
[00:38.32]Out here on the line
[00:39.37]
[00:40.31]If you love me
[00:43.22]Let me know
[00:44.80]So all of me
[00:47.29]Can just let go
[00:49.09]You can have me
[00:52.07]Heart and soul
[00:53.62]If you love me, then
[00:57.68]Just let me know
[00:59.36]You let me think that
[00:59.59]
[01:00.91]I don't have a chance
[01:03.32](None at all)
[01:04.10]You turn away when
[01:05.72]I capture your glance
[01:06.96](Should I fall)
[01:08.18]And then you say
[01:09.36]You've been
[01:10.85]Dreamin' of me
[01:11.61](Am I right)
[01:12.67]And I don't know what
[01:13.99]I should believe
[01:15.70](Am I right)
[01:16.88]And I don't know what
[01:18.78]I should believe
[01:19.97]If you love me
[01:22.97]Let me know
[01:24.70]So all of me
[01:27.45]Can just let go
[01:29.13]You can have me
[01:31.81]Heart and soul
[01:33.53]If you love me, then
[01:37.53]Just let me know
[01:39.17]
[01:40.40]I wanna give you
[01:42.55]What you need
[01:44.56]I wanna be there
[01:46.56]In your dreams
[01:48.80]You gotta show me
[01:50.84]That you want it
[01:52.95]As much as I do
[01:55.44]
[02:14.72]Wish I could tell by
[02:16.53]The look in your eyes
[02:19.12]Don't leave my heart
[02:20.66]Out here on the line
[02:22.48]If you love me
[02:25.38]Let me know
[02:27.00]So all of me
[02:29.75]Can just let go
[02:31.37]You can have me
[02:34.12]Heart and soul
[02:35.81]If you love me, then
[02:39.97]Just let me know
[02:43.11]
[02:44.36]Just let me know
[02:44.57]Just let me know
[02:48.89]Just let me know
