[00:04.94]
[00:11.73]When I look in your eyes
[00:14.84]I can feel my temperature rise
[00:17.87]I feel emotions burning inside of me
[00:21.39]I thank god every day of my life
[00:23.95]
[00:25.23]When I look in your eyes
[00:28.05]I can feel my temperature rise
[00:31.47]I feel emotions burning inside of me
[00:34.01]I thank god every day of my life
[00:36.71]
[00:38.09]I never forget
[00:39.74]When I look in your eyes
[00:41.16]When we met
[00:41.51]summer of 0'5
[00:41.78]Never would
[00:42.90]Of guessed or expected
[00:43.97]to feel so alive
[00:45.98]Cause you were like a local
[00:47.45]And I was more like a visitor
[00:49.39]But from the second I saw you
[00:51.58]I knew I had to get with ya
[00:53.21]Spit a little game
[00:54.47]You acted like you got nausous
[00:55.41]I’m laughing
[00:57.07]And I’m thinking to myself stay cautious
[00:59.48]Cuz, I know you heard of my past.
[01:01.59]And reputation, for that some hesitation, in fact some separation
[01:05.23]But eventually, we were both consumed by the energy
[01:09.28]Like what could we do
[01:11.13]We knew there was chemistry
[01:13.00]Felt, the attraction, and felt the connection,
[01:16.52]and felt the affection, and itself was a blessing.
[01:20.00]So now I’m contemplating,
[01:23.31]Trying to plot my next move, I told you I don’t care what it takes
[01:25.44]I got to get you

[01:59.16]
[02:00.50]I don’t got the patience or time, and
[02:02.31]I don’t need to act hard when I’m saying my rhyme,
[02:05.20]Cuz see I’m grown up, I’m passed that, I’m over the limit.
[02:08.60]I’m over these women, living with the phoniest image,

[02:22.41]It’s we not me,
[02:25.33]So the both of us feelin it
[02:26.58]Never pictured myself as a co dependent
[02:28.79]But I depend on you, and with that there’s no pretending
[02:31.62]That you make me better,
[02:34.56]When we grow together.
