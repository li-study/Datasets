[00:03.46]on the radio
[00:08.15]Regina Spektor
[00:13.06]
[00:21.56]This is how it works
[00:23.53]It feels a little worse
[00:25.54]Than when we drove our hearse
[00:27.95]Right through that screaming crowd
[00:30.31]While laughing up a storm
[00:32.70]Until we were just bone
[00:35.06]Until it got so warm
[00:37.47]That none of us could sleep
[00:39.55]And all the styrofoam
[00:41.73]Began to melt away
[00:44.48]We tried to find some words
[00:46.61]To aid in the decay
[00:48.83]But none of them were home
[00:51.19]Inside their catacomb
[00:53.94]A million ancient bees
[00:56.25]Began to sting our knees
[00:58.42]While we were on our knees
[01:00.72]Praying that disease
[01:03.13]Would leave the ones we love
[01:06.07]And never come again On the radio
[01:10.04]
[01:11.00]We heard November Rain
[01:12.85]That solo's really long
[01:15.16]But it's a pretty song
[01:17.62]We listened to it twice
[01:19.69]'Cause the DJ was asleep
[01:22.34]
[01:31.58]This is how it works
[01:32.98]You're young until you're not
[01:35.81]You love until you don't
[01:37.94]You try until you can't
[01:40.41]You laugh until you cry
[01:42.72]You cry until you laugh
[01:45.15]And everyone must breathe
[01:47.39]Until their dying breath
[01:49.72]
[01:50.33]No, this is how it works
[01:52.55]You peer inside yourself
[01:54.52]You take the things you like
[01:56.71]And try to love the things you took
[01:58.88]And then you take that love you made
[02:01.46]And stick it into some
[02:03.83]Someone else's heart
[02:06.31]Pumping someone else's blood
[02:08.91]And walking arm in arm
[02:10.90]You hope it don't get harmed
[02:13.42]But even if it does
[02:15.78]You'll just do it all again
[02:17.47]
[02:18.51]And on the radio
[02:20.48]You hear November Rain
[02:22.53]That solo's awful long
[02:24.86]But it's a good refrain
[02:27.85]You listen to it twice
[02:29.65]'Cause the DJ is asleep
[02:32.39]On the radio
[02:34.21](oh oh oh)
[02:35.23]On the radio
[02:37.36]On the radio - uh oh
[02:39.99]On the radio - uh oh
[02:42.10]On the radio - uh oh
[02:44.55]On the radio
[02:46.65]oh
[02:51.45]
