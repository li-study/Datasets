[00:00.00]Starry starry night
[00:04.17]paint your palette blue and grey
[00:09.12]look out on a summer\'s day
[00:12.31]with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
[00:16.54]Shadows on the hills
[00:20.91]sketch the trees and the daffodils
[00:25.94]catch the breeze and the winter chills
[00:29.73]in colors on the snowy linen land.
[00:36.22]And now I understand
[00:40.71]what you tried to say to me
[00:45.44]and how you suffered for your sanity
[00:50.27]and how you tried to set them free.
[00:53.32]They would not listen they did not know how
[00:58.82]perhaps they\'ll listen now.
[01:04.49]Starry starry night
[01:09.14]flaming flowers that brightly blaze
[01:14.38]swirling clouds in violet haze
[01:18.05]reflect in Vincent\'s eyes of China blue.
[01:22.41]Colors changing hue
[01:26.91]morning fields of amber grain
[01:32.12]weathered faces lined in pain
[01:36.22]are smoothed beneath the artist\'s loving hand.
[01:40.49]And now I understand
[01:45.34]what you tried to say to me
[01:49.21]and how you suffered for your sanity
[01:54.54]and how you tried to set them free.
[01:57.31]They would not listen they did not know how
[02:02.64]perhaps they\'ll listen now.
[02:06.15]For they could not love you
[02:10.46]but still your love was true
[02:15.28]and when no hope was left in sight on that
[02:19.66]starry starry night.
[02:22.14]You took your life as lovers often do,
[02:27.22]But I could have told you Vincent
[02:31.32]this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
[02:40.63]Starry starry night
[02:45.27]portraits hung in empty halls
[02:50.39]frameless heads on nameless walls
[02:54.20]with eyes that watch the world and can\'t forget.
[02:58.08]Like the stranger that you\'ve met
[03:02.84]the ragged men in ragged clothes
[03:07.38]the silver thorn of bloddy rose
[03:10.88]lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
[03:16.32]And now I think I know
[03:21.27]what you tried to say to me
[03:25.81]and how you suffered for your sanity
[03:31.37]and how you tried to set them free.
[03:34.19]They would not listen they\'re not listening still
[03:40.18]perhaps they never will.
