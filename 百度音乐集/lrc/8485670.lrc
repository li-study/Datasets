[00:00.00]All I want is your understanding
[00:02.48]As in a small act of affection
[00:05.08]
[00:10.15]Why is this my life
[00:11.68]
[00:12.68]Is almost everybody's question
[00:14.71]
[00:18.00]And I've tried,everything but suicide
[00:25.21]
[00:27.28]But it's crossed my mind
[00:29.08]
[00:38.26]I prefer peace
[00:40.08]
[00:41.02]Wouldn't have to have one
[00:42.58]Wordly possession
[00:43.48]
[00:47.40]But Essentially I'm an animal
[00:49.78]
[00:50.24]So just what do I do with all the aggression?
[00:53.78]
[00:56.48]Well I've tried everything but suicied
[01:02.48]
[01:04.96]But it's crossed my mind
[01:07.33]
[01:15.11]Life is a one way street ain't it
[01:17.58]If you could paint it
[01:18.68]I'd draw myself going in the right direction
[01:21.48]
[01:24.24]So I'll go all the way like I really really know
[01:27.38]But truth is I'm only guessing
[01:30.65]
[01:33.48]And I've tried,everything but suicide
[01:42.33]But it's crossed my mind
[01:43.58]
[01:47.08]Just a thought
[01:48.08]
[01:53.53]It's even dark in the daytime
[01:55.68]It's not just good it's great depression
[01:58.21]
[02:02.78]When I was lost I even found myself
[02:05.08]
[02:06.38]Looking in the gun's direction
[02:07.72]
[02:12.10]So I've tried,everything but suicide
[02:18.08]
[02:19.38]But yes it's crossed my mind
[02:21.68]
[02:24.80]But I'm fine
