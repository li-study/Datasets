[00:16.30]I've seen your face a thousand times
[00:20.42]Have all your stories memorized
[00:24.66]I've kissed your lips a million ways
[00:28.48]But I still love to have you around
[00:31.49]I've held you too many times to count
[00:35.87]I think I know you inside out
[00:40.79]And we're together most days
[00:44.34]But I still love to have you around
[00:48.23]You're the one I want and it's not just phase
[00:56.67]You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing
[01:04.72]Don't go away
[01:06.88]My love (my love)
[01:08.75]I want you to stay
[01:10.60]In my life
[01:12.87]Don't go away
[01:15.01]My lover (my love)
[01:16.84]I'm happiest when we spend time
[01:21.07]You're a salty water ocean wave
[01:25.24]You knock me down, you kiss my face
[01:28.93]I know the storms will always come
[01:32.77]But I still love to have you around
[01:37.35]Heaven knows what will come next
[01:41.00]So emotional, you're so complex
[01:45.03]A rollercoaster built to crash
[01:48.97]But I still love to have you around
[01:53.56]You're the one I want and it's not just phase
[02:00.94]You're the one I trust, our love is the real thing
[02:08.81]Don't go away
[02:10.78]My love (my love)
[02:12.66]I want you to stay
[02:14.61]In my life
[02:16.82]Don't go away
[02:18.80]My lover (my love)
[02:21.04]I'm happiest when we spend time (it's only you and I)
[02:41.24]It's you there when I close my eyes
[02:44.58]And you in the morning
[02:47.09]I never thought you'd still be mine
[02:52.46]Or I'd really need to have you around
[02:56.16]Don't go away
[02:58.51]My love (you're my love supply)
[03:00.42]I want you to stay
[03:02.27]In my life (every day, every night)
[03:04.39]Don't go away
[03:06.42]My love (you're my love supply)
[03:09.09]I need you, you're my love supply
