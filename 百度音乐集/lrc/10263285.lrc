[02:27.39][00:08.72]There was a man, a lonely man,
[00:22.72]who lost his love through his indifference.
[00:37.12]A heart that kept, that went unchecked,
[00:51.16]until it died within his silence.
[03:46.53][02:53.59][01:03.62]And Solitaire's the only game in town,
[03:53.31][03:00.32][01:10.67]and every road that takes him down.
[03:06.86][01:17.54]And by himself, it's easy to pretend,
[03:12.77][01:23.17]he'll never love again.
[03:19.91][01:30.67]And keeping to himself he plays the game,
[03:26.57][01:37.40]without her love it always ends the same.
[03:59.75][03:33.08][01:44.30]While life goes on around him everywhere,
[04:06.62][03:38.97][01:50.17]he's playing Solitaire.
[01:59.74]A little hope goes up in smoke,
[02:13.60]just how it goes, goes without saying.
[02:41.65]who would command the hand he's playing.
