[00:07.70]
[00:09.70]The sun just slipped its note below my door
[00:14.11]And I can't hide beneath my sheets
[00:18.38]I've read the words before so now I know
[00:22.81]For time has come again for me
[01:53.42][01:01.12][00:25.76]And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
[02:16.34][02:11.69][01:58.82][01:06.37][00:31.29]Feelin' the same way all over again
[02:20.39][02:02.88][01:10.58][00:35.61]Singin' the same lines all over again
[02:29.22][02:24.39][02:06.76][01:14.42][00:39.66]No matter how much I pretend
[02:32.93]Ahâ€¦
[02:43.72][01:18.90]
[00:44.75]Another day that I can't find my head
[00:48.91]My feet don't look like they're my own
[00:53.46]I'll try and find the floor below to stand
[00:57.77]I hope I reach it once again
[01:36.82]So many times I wonder where I've gone
[01:41.44]And how I find my way back in
[01:45.74]I look around a while for something lost
[01:50.04]Maby I'll find it in the end
