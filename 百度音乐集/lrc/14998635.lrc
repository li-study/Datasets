[00:07.58]If you search for tenderness
[00:11.26]It isn't hard to find
[00:13.88]You can have the love you need to live
[00:19.98]But if you look for truthfulness
[00:24.40]You might just as well be blind
[00:27.47]It always seems to be so hard to give
[03:05.28][01:32.29][00:35.29]Honesty is such a lonely word
[03:11.00][01:39.69][00:42.54]Everyone is so untrue
[03:16.88][01:46.48][00:48.72]Honesty is hardly ever heard
[03:25.04][01:54.01][00:56.63]And mostly what I need from you
[03:33.59][02:00.06][01:02.94]
[01:04.38]I can always find someone
[01:08.09]To say they sympathize
[01:11.37]If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
[01:16.84]But I don't want some pretty face
[01:21.42]To tell me pretty lies
[01:24.80]All I want is someone to believe
[02:04.77]I can find a lover
[02:08.31]I can find a friend
[02:11.56]I can have security
[02:14.83]Until the bitter end
[02:18.34]Anyone can comfort me
[02:21.80]With promises again
[02:24.97]I know, (I know) I know
[02:36.24]When I'm deep inside of me
[02:40.14]Don't be too concerned
[02:43.43]I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
[02:49.61]But when I want sincerity
[02:53.45]Tell me where else can I turn
[02:56.87]Because you're the one that I depend upon
