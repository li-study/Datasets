[00:00.00]Misty Blue
[00:02.07]
[00:04.41]Oh it's been such a long long time
[00:10.24]looks like I get you off my mind
[00:15.96]Oh but I can't just the thought of you
[00:21.89]turns my world a misty blue
[00:27.53]Just the mention of your name
[00:33.26]turns the flicker to a flame
[00:39.04]I think of things we used to do
[00:44.88]then my whole world turns misty blue
[00:51.34]
[00:53.85]I should forget you
[00:59.41]heaven knows I've tried
[01:05.15]But when I said I'm glad we're through
[01:11.05]my heart knows I've lied
[01:15.58]
[01:16.39]Oh it's been such a long long time
[01:22.96]looks like I get you off my mind
[01:28.82]Oh but I can't just the thought of you
[01:34.54]turns my world a misty blue
[01:39.84]
[01:40.52]but I can't just the thought of you
[01:46.61]turns my world a misty blue
[01:52.24]
[01:52.55]Oh it's been such a long long time
[01:58.64]looks like I get you off my mind
[02:04.29]Oh but I can't just the thought of you
[02:10.02]turns my world a misty blue
[02:19.43]
