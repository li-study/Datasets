[00:08.31]
[00:24.40]The summer sun
[00:26.06]It blows my mind
[00:28.04]It's falling down on all that I've ever known
[00:31.85]Time to kiss the world goodbye
[00:35.32]Falling down on all that I've ever known
[00:40.29]Is all that I've ever known
[00:43.69]
[00:57.60]A dying scream
[00:59.29]It makes no sound
[01:01.14]Calling out to all that I've ever known
[01:05.03]Here am I, lost and found
[01:08.49]Calling out to all
[01:12.15]
[01:14.31]We live a dying dream
[01:21.57]If you know what I mean
[01:24.71]All that I've ever known
[01:28.01]It's all that I've ever known
[01:32.41]
[01:38.00]Catch the wind that breaks the butterfly
[01:44.90]I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
[01:52.36]I tried to talk with God to no avail
[01:58.86]Calling my name from out of nowhere
[02:02.94]I said "If you won't save me, 
[02:05.04]please don't waste my time"
[02:08.63]
[03:09.43]Catch the wind that breaks the butterfly
[03:16.77]I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
[03:23.97]I tried to talk with God to no avail
[03:30.51]Calling my name from out of nowhere
[03:34.63]I said "If you won't save me, 
[03:36.69]please don't waste my time"

[03:53.37]The summer sun

[04:04.19]Falling down on all that I've ever known
