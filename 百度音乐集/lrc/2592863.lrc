[00:00.50]You And Me Against The World
[00:05.56]- Helen Reddy
[00:09.56]
[00:11.95]You and me against the world,
[00:16.01]Sometimes it seems like
[00:18.66]you and me against the world,
[00:22.25]When all the others turn their
[00:24.90]backs and walked away,
[00:28.06]You can count on me to stay.
[00:33.40]
[00:35.50]Remember
[00:36.77]when the circus came to town
[00:42.19]And you were frightened by the clown,
[00:48.50]Wasn't it nice to be around
[00:52.22]someone that you knew,
[00:55.40]Someone who was big and strong
[00:58.21]and looking out for
[01:01.47]
[01:03.32]You and me against the world,
[01:06.66]Sometimes it seems like
[01:08.68]you and me against the world
[01:15.04]And for all the times we've cried
[01:19.25]I always felt that
[01:21.25]God was on our side.
[01:23.94]
[01:26.57]And when one of us is gone,
[01:32.41]And one of us is left to carry on,
[01:39.39]Then remembering will have to do,
[01:44.70]Our memories alone will get us through
[01:50.98]Think about the days of me and you,
[01:56.72]Of you and me against the world.
