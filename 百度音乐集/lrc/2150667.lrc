[00:00.50]Never Say Goodbye
[00:03.30]Bon Jovi
[00:07.30]
[00:15.81]As I sit in this smokey room
[00:19.85]The night about to end
[00:23.32]I pass my time with strangers
[00:26.22]But this bottle's my only friend
[00:30.56]Remember when we used to park
[00:34.22]On Butler Street out in the dark
[00:37.67]Remember when we lost the keys
[00:41.29]And you lost more than that in my backseat baby
[00:45.06]Remember how we used to talk
[00:47.49]About busting out  we'd break their hearts
[00:51.48]Together  forever
[00:57.70]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[01:03.80]
[01:05.54]You and me and my old friends
[01:09.10]Hoping it would never end
[01:12.68]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[01:19.79]Holdin on  we got to try
[01:23.27]Holdin on to never say goodbye
[01:28.72]
[01:41.43]Remember days of skipping school
[01:44.97]Racing cars and being cool
[01:48.09]With a six pack and the radio
[01:51.50]We didn't need no place to go
[01:55.92]Remember at the prom that night
[01:58.99]You and me we had a fight
[02:02.27]But the band they played our favorite song
[02:06.63]And I held you in my arms so strong
[02:09.36]We danced so close
[02:11.11]We danced so slow
[02:12.61]And I swore I'd never let you go
[02:16.54]Together   forever
[02:22.71]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[02:28.87]
[02:30.69]You and me and my old friends
[02:34.19]Hoping it would never end
[02:37.74]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[02:44.82]Holdin on  we got to try
[02:48.35]Holdin on to never say goodbye
[02:53.86]
[03:19.31]I guess you'd say we used to talk
[03:23.05]About busting out
[03:24.87]We'd break their hearts
[03:26.86]Together  forever
[03:32.89]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[03:38.93]
[03:40.72]You and me and my old friends
[03:44.16]Hoping it would never end
[03:47.78]Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
[03:54.93]Holdin on we got to try
[03:58.39]Holdin on to never say goodbye
[04:07.41]
