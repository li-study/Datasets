[00:10.73]
[00:11.90]Got my headlights shining
[00:15.63]Down an old dirt road
[00:18.34]Smoke my cigarettes
[00:19.98]I should quit, I know
[00:22.44]
[00:22.74]The radio’s playing
[00:25.58]Old country songs
[00:28.46]Someone’s leaving, someone’s cheating,
[00:31.08]On and on
[00:33.05]
[00:34.04]I think I might like
[00:36.22]The quiet nights,
[00:38.70]Of this empty life
[00:42.13]
[00:43.15]'Cause someday maybe
[00:47.77]Somebody will love me like I need
[00:49.49]And someday I won’t have to prove
[00:51.80]'Cause somebody will see
[00:53.64]All my worth but until then
[00:56.09]I’ll do just fine on my own
[01:00.72]With my cigarettes
[01:06.71]And this old dirt road
[01:07.72]
[01:14.82]See I left another
[01:18.09]Good man tonight
[01:20.73]I wonder if he'll miss me
[01:22.56]Lord knows I tried
[01:24.53]
[01:25.91]But I think that maybe
[01:28.22]The thing that I did wrong
[01:31.18]Was put up with this bullshit
[01:33.10]For far too long
[01:36.23]
[01:36.47]I think I might like
[01:38.87]The quiet nights,
[01:42.03]Of this empty life
[01:44.51]
[01:46.07]'Cause someday maybe
[01:47.92]Somebody will love me like I need
[01:51.25]And someday I won’t have to prove
[01:55.52]'Cause somebody will see
[01:56.32]All my worth but until then
[01:58.86]I’ll do just fine on my own
[02:03.60]With my cigarettes
[02:04.59]And this old dirt road
[02:06.67]
[02:09.52]I ain’t gonna sleep
[02:12.04]I don't wanna dream
[02:14.92]About the things that I used to need
[02:19.69]I aint’ gonna cry
[02:22.28]Or go on living lies
[02:25.55]I'm just gonna drive
[02:28.34]
[02:32.70]'Cause someday
[02:34.28]Maybe somebody will love me
[02:36.55]And someday I won’t have to prove
[02:41.67]All my worth
[02:44.55]But until then I’ll do just fine on my own
[02:50.21]With my cigarettes and this old
[02:52.63]
[02:53.63]'Cause someday maybe
[02:55.36]Somebody will love me like I need
[02:58.36]And someday I won’t have to prove
[03:01.81]'Cause somebody will see
[03:03.77]All my worth but until then
[03:06.74]I’ll do just fine on my own
[03:10.59]With my cigarettes
[03:12.56]And this old dirt road
