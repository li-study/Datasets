[00:10.32]Another red letter day,
[00:12.98]so the pound has dropped
[00:14.51]and the children are creating.
[00:16.98]The other half ran away,
[00:19.27]taking all the cash
[00:20.82]and leaving you with the lumber.
[00:23.28]Got a pain in the chest,
[00:24.91]doctors on strike
[00:26.47]what you need is a rest.
[00:28.48]It's not easy love
[00:31.64]but you've got friends
[00:33.47]you can trust.
[00:35.67]Friends will be friends,
[00:38.49]when you're in need of love
[00:39.92]they give you care and attention.
[00:42.40]Friends will be friends,
[00:44.66]when you're through with life
[00:46.30]and all hope is lost.
[00:48.09]Hold out your hand
[00:49.62]cos friends will be friends
[00:56.42]right till the end.

[01:09.63]Now it's a beautiful day.
[01:12.08]The postman delivered
[01:13.65]a letter from your lover.
[01:16.03]Only a phone call away,
[01:18.54]you tried to track him down
[01:20.03]but somebody stole his number.
[01:22.37]As a matter of fact,
[01:24.01]you're getting used to life
[01:25.76]without him in your way.
[01:27.64]It's so easy now,
[01:30.78]cos you got friends you can trust.
[01:34.86]Friends will be friends,
[01:37.62]when you're in need of love
[01:39.21]they give you care and attention.
[01:41.62]Friends will be friends,
[01:44.10]when you're through with life
[01:45.60]and all hope is lost.
[01:47.08]Hold out your hand
[01:48.69]cos friends will be friends
[01:55.52]right till the end.
