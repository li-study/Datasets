[00:01.12]Green Day - East Jesus Nowhere
[00:07.89]
[00:40.05]Raise your hands now to testify
[00:43.32]Your confession will be crucified
[00:46.69]You're a sacrificial suicide
[00:50.02]Like a dog that's been sodomized
[00:52.80]Stand up! - All the white boys
[00:56.97]Sit down! - All the black girls
[01:01.95]You're the soldiers of the new world
[01:07.19]
[01:07.44]Put your faith in miracle
[01:10.39]And it's non-denominational
[01:13.52]Join the choir we will be singing
[01:16.88]In the church of wishful thinking
[01:19.79]
[01:20.04]A fire burns today
[01:22.79]Of blasphemy and genocide
[01:26.35]The sirens of decay
[01:29.45]Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
[01:43.01]
[01:46.76]Oh bless me lord for I have sinned
[01:53.50]It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
[02:00.07]I therw my crutches in "The river
[02:04.29]Of a shadow of doubt"
[02:07.00]And I'll be dressed in my Sunday best
[02:12.24]
[02:13.41]Say a prayer for the family
[02:16.74]Drop a coin for humanity
[02:20.06]Ain't this uniform so flattering?
[02:23.27]I never asked you a god damned thing
[02:26.02]
[02:26.28]A fire burns today
[02:29.34]Of blasphemy and genocide
[02:32.83]The sirens of decay
[02:35.84]Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
[02:50.96]
[02:54.96]Don't test me
[02:58.05]Second Guess me
[03:01.40]Protest Me
[03:03.81]You will disappear
[03:05.66]
[03:06.25]I want to know who's allowed to breed
[03:09.64]All the dogs who never learned to read
[03:12.88]Missionary politicians
[03:16.25]And the cops of a new religion
[03:54.39]
[03:57.57]A fire burns today
[04:01.55]Of blasphemy and genocide
[04:06.00]The sirens of decay
[04:09.81]Will infiltrate the inside
[04:21.29]
