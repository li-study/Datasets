[00:03.89]Elton John
[00:04.90]
[00:07.64]Goodbye Norma Jean
[00:10.72]Though I never knew you at all
[00:13.99]You had the grace to hold yourself
[00:17.20]While those around you crawled
[00:22.19]They crawled out of the woodwork
[00:25.99]And they whispered into your brain.
[00:29.10]They set you on the treadmill
[00:32.34]And they made you change your name
[00:37.94]And it seems to me you lived your life
[00:41.80]like a candle in the wind:
[00:45.70]Never knowing who to cling to
[00:49.40]when the rain set in
[00:53.38]And I would have liked to have known you
[00:56.72]But I was just a kid
[00:59.48]Your candle burned out long before
[01:03.31]your legend ever did.
[01:07.05]
[01:18.86]Loneliness was tough;
[01:21.72]The toughest role you ever played
[01:25.39]Hollywood created a superstar
[01:28.86]And pain was the price you paid
[01:33.90]Even when you died
[01:37.73]The press still hounded you
[01:41.01]All the papers had to say
[01:44.26]Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
[01:49.83]And it seems to me you lived your life
[01:54.64]like a candle in the wind:
[01:57.30]Never knowing who to cling to
[02:01.08]when the rain set in.
[02:05.31]And I would have liked to have known you
[02:08.57]But I was just a kid
[02:11.37]Your candle burned out long before
[02:15.14]your legend ever did.
[02:30.83]Goodbye Norma Jean
[02:33.69]Though I never knew you at all
[02:36.91]You had the grace to hold yourself
[02:40.34]While those around you crawled
[02:46.25]Goodbye Norma Jean
[02:48.92]From the young man in the 22nd row
[02:52.50]Who sees you as something more than sexual
[02:55.67]More than just our Marilyn Monroe
[03:01.46]And it seems to me you lived your life
[03:05.13]like a candle in the wind
[03:08.93]Never knowing who to cling to
[03:12.60]when the rain set in.
[03:16.83]And I would have liked to have known you
[03:19.77]But I was just a kid
[03:22.74]Your candle burned out long before
[03:26.49]your legend ever did
[03:32.68]Your candle burned out long before
[03:36.31]your legend ever did
[03:44.84]
