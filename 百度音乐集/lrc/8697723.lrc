[00:35.73]High, higher than the sun
[00:38.50]You shoot me from a gun
[00:40.65]I need you to elevate me here
[00:45.30]At corner of your lips
[00:47.20]As the orbit of your hips
[00:49.37]Eclipse
[00:50.38]You elevate my soul
[00:53.77]I’ve got no self control
[00:55.83]Been living like a mole now
[00:58.51]Going down, excavation
[01:01.62]I and I in the sky
[01:04.28]You make me feel like I can fly
[01:06.83]So high
[01:08.14]Elevation
[01:19.00]A star
[01:20.08]Lit up like a cigar
[01:22.15]Strung out like a guitar
[01:24.33]Maybe you can educate my mind
[01:28.84]Explain all these controls
[01:30.83]Can’t sing but I’ve got soul
[01:33.05]The goal is elevation
[01:36.43]A mole
[01:37.52]Digging in a hole
[01:39.65]Digging up my soul now
[01:41.91]Going down, excavation
[01:45.10]I and I in the sky
[01:47.76]You make me feel like I can fly
[01:50.32]So high
[01:51.77]Elevation
[02:11.93]Love
[02:14.78]Lift me up out of these blues
[02:19.55]Won’t you tell me something true
[02:23.95]I believe in you
[02:35.29]A mole
[02:36.47]Digging in a hole
[02:38.60]Digging up my soul now
[02:40.80]Going down, excavation
[02:43.98]Higher now
[02:45.13]In the sky
[02:46.69]You make me feel like I can fly
[02:49.27]So high
