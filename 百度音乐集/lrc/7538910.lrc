[00:00.00]I Do Love You
[00:03.00]Declan Galbraith
[00:05.84]
[00:11.71]In your eyes I see the pain
[00:17.61]Of a child who runs away
[00:23.28]And he's thinking that tomorrow
[00:28.90]Will be OK like in a fairytale
[00:34.62]I close my eyes, and see your dreams
[00:40.42]Of a perfect, loving man
[00:45.78]But some things don’t come so easily
[00:51.85]You know I'll try if you give me a chance
[00:55.59]'Cause I do love you
[01:01.16]Yes I do love you
[01:06.83]And dreams do come true
[01:11.24]Baby I love you so
[01:19.23]In your eyes, I see as true
[01:25.18]...'s more that's, harmony
[01:30.69]And don’t worry about tomorrow
[01:36.29]I’ll be your friend, you can lean on me
[01:40.44]'Cause I do love you
[01:46.02]Yes I do love you
[01:51.61]And dreams do come true
[01:56.04]Baby I love you so
[01:59.84]Just you 'n me
[02:02.05]You know, I love you
[02:03.87]For all those times that I've been wrong
[02:09.27]I ask you baby please
[02:13.75]Understand
[02:15.29]You know it takes some praying
[02:19.42]For a dream, to grow strong
[02:24.79]'Cause I do love you
[02:30.66]Yes, I do love you
[02:36.10]And dreams do come true
[02:40.71]Baby I love you so
[02:44.39]Just you 'n me
[02:46.15]'Cause I do love you
[02:52.87]Yes I do love you
[02:58.50]And dreams do come true
[03:03.00]Baby I love you so
[03:06.51]You know I love you
