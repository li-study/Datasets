[00:00.00]Siters of mercy
[00:00.05]Leonard Cohen
[00:00.08]
[00:01.00]Oh the sisters of mercy,
[00:03.74]they are not departed or gone.
[00:12.45]They were waiting for me
[00:15.05]when I thought that I just can't go on.
[00:23.02]And they brought me their comfort and later
[00:26.67]they brought me this song.
[00:33.35]Oh I hope you run into them,
[00:36.64]you who've been travelling so long.
[00:40.90]
[00:56.46]Yes you who must leave everything
[01:00.49]that you cannot control.
[01:07.01]It begins with your family,
[01:09.82]but soon it comes around to your soul.
[01:17.25]Well I've been where you're hanging,
[01:20.04]I think I can see how you're pinned.
[01:27.49]When you're not feeling holy,
[01:30.19]your loneliness says that you've sinned.
[01:34.08]
[01:49.87]Well they lay down beside me,
[01:52.77]I made my confession to them.
[02:00.72]They touched both my eyes
[02:03.72]and I touched the dew on their hem.
[02:10.63]If your life is a leaf
[02:13.47]that the seasons tear off and condemn
[02:21.05]they will bind you with love
[02:23.49]that is graceful and green as a stem.
[02:27.22]
[02:43.12]When I left they were sleeping,
[02:45.60]I hope you run into them soon.
[02:54.02]Don't turn on the lights,
[02:56.32]you can read their address by the moon.
[03:03.68]And you won't make me jealous
[03:06.25]if I hear that they sweetened your night.
[03:13.73]We weren't lovers like that
[03:16.28]and besides it would still be all right,
[03:24.21]We weren't lovers like that
[03:27.13]and besides it would still be all right.
