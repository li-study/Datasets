[00:12.63]Sunday morning, I heard the preacher say
[00:20.39]Thou shall not kill
[00:24.29]I don\'t wanna hear nothing else about killing
[00:32.80]And that it\'s God\'s will
[00:37.33]\'Cause our children are watching us
[00:41.52]They put their trust in us
[00:44.32]They\'re gonna be like us
[00:48.69]So let\'s learn from our history
[00:53.07]And do it differently
[00:59.17]I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
[01:05.05]I hope, we\'ll have more than we\'ll ever need
[01:10.48]I hope, we\'ll have more happy ever after
[01:16.82]I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
[01:21.91]And we can lose all the pain and misery
[01:29.58]I hope, I hope
[01:33.68]Oh, Rosie, her man he gets too rough
[01:40.76]That\'s all she can say, is he\'s a good man
[01:48.16]He don\'t mean no harm
[01:51.44]He was just brought up that way
[01:58.20]But our children are watching us
[02:02.51]They put their trust in us
[02:05.06]They\'re gonna be like us
[02:09.82]It\'s okay for us to disagree
[02:14.11]We can work it out lovingly
[02:20.56]I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
[02:25.67]I hope, we\'ll have more than we\'ll ever need
[02:31.36]I hope, we\'ll have more happy ever after
[02:37.64]I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
[02:42.83]And we can lose all the pain and misery
[02:50.06]I hope, I hope
[02:56.49]There must be a way to change what\'s going on
[03:07.48]No I don\'t have all the answers
[03:17.45]I hope, for more love, more joy and laughter
[03:22.90]I hope, we\'ll have more than we\'ll ever need
[03:29.20]I hope, we\'ll have more happy ever after
[03:34.64]I hope, we can all live more fearlessly
[03:39.48]And we can lose all the pain and misery
[03:46.54]I hope, I hope
[03:51.30]I hope, I hope, I hope
