[00:22.59]Ran from the noise
[00:27.71]Ran from the bustle
[00:32.82]I'm so alone,all alone
[00:40.69]It's so empty and cold
[00:48.29]This place I've come to
[00:53.72]Trapped in a world of blackness
[01:00.42]
[01:04.14]I don't know who I am
[01:09.36]I don't know if I even exist
[01:14.59]Am I a reflection in the mist?
[01:21.99]
[01:24.78]I can't feel what's inside
[01:30.18]I don't konw if anything's in here
[01:35.59]This feeling of numbness takes over
[01:42.26]
[01:43.42]Cuz I only exist
[01:50.83]With the existence of another
[01:59.72]But no one exists...
[02:06.64]No where to go
[02:11.86]No where to hide or cry
[02:17.26]I'm so alone.I'm so alone and more

[03:48.96]So now I am a doll
[03:55.92]With no warmth to hold
[04:01.49]Can't move no more
[04:05.10]The light's been turned off
[04:12.05]I feel nothing in my hands
[04:17.03]Nothing in my own heart
[04:22.45]Not even the pain of emptiness
