[00:15.61]All alone at the end of the  evening
[00:21.73]And the bright lights have faded to blue
[00:29.64]I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
[00:36.54]Loved me and I never knew
[00:43.74]You know I've always been a dreamer
[00:49.65](spent my life running 'round)
[00:53.59]And it's so hard to change
[00:57.21](Can't seem to settle down)
[01:01.57]But the dreams I've seen lately
[01:09.10]Keep on turning out and burning out
[01:13.29]And turning out the same
[01:18.42]
[01:19.44]So put me on a highway
[01:22.95]And show me a sign
[01:27.18]And take it to the limit one more time
[01:35.32]
[01:47.42]You can spend all your time making money
[01:54.05]You can spend all your love making time
[02:01.22]If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
[02:06.88]Would you still be mine?
[02:09.58]
[02:16.88]And when you're looking for your freedom
[02:21.48](Nobody seems to care)
[02:25.10]And you can't find the door
[02:28.06](Can't find it anywhere)
[02:32.50]When there's nothing to believe in
[02:38.01]Still you're coming back, you're running back for more
[02:49.04]
[02:50.23]So put me on a highway
[02:53.92]And show me a sign
[02:57.67]And take it to the limit one more time
[03:05.26]
[03:05.95]Take it to the limit
[03:08.92]Take it to the limit
[03:12.73]Take it to the limit one more time
[03:24.30]
