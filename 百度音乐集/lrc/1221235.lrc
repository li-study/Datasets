[01:13.72]I just want to feel safe in my own skin
[01:24.23]I just want to be happy again
[01:35.11]I just want to feel deep in my own world
[01:45.12]but I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore
[02:07.19]On a different day if I was safe in my own skin
[02:17.22]then I wouldn't feel so lost and so frightened
[02:26.94]But this is today and I'm lost in my own skin
[02:39.37]And I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore
[04:13.86]I just want to feel safe in my own skin
[04:23.72]I just want to be happy again
