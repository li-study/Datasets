[00:35.16]I've often wondered if there's
[00:38.88]Ever been a perfect family
[00:43.19]I've always longed for undividedness
[00:46.27]And sought stability
[00:52.64]A flower taught me how to prey
[00:56.64]But as I grew, that flower changed
[01:00.39]She started flailing in the wind
[01:04.27]Like golden petals scattering
[01:07.97]And I miss you dandelion
[01:10.87]And even love you
[01:15.08]And I wish there was a way
[01:18.46]For me to trust you
[01:22.85]But it hurts me every time
[01:26.25]I try to touch you
[01:30.43]But I miss you dandelion
[01:34.00]And even love you
[01:39.72]I gravitated towards a patriarch
[01:44.04]So young predictably
[01:47.06]I was resigned to spend my life
[01:50.60]With a maze of misery
[01:57.17]A boy and a girl befriended me
[02:00.95]We're bonded through despondency
[02:04.71]I stayed so long but finally
[02:08.65]I fled to save my sanity
[02:12.61]And I miss you little sis and
[02:15.82]Little brother
[02:19.82]And I hope you realize
[02:23.17]I'll always love you
[02:27.21]And although you're struggling
[02:30.50]You will recover
[02:35.05]And I miss you little sis and
[02:38.77]Little brother
[02:43.07]So many I considered
[02:46.79]Closest to me
[02:50.40]Turned on a dime and sold me
[02:54.37]Out dutiful
[02:57.88]Although that knife was chipping
[03:02.00]Away at me
[03:05.69]They turned their eyes away from me and
[03:10.66]Went home to sleep
[03:17.17]And I miss a lot of life
[03:20.07]But I'll recover
[03:24.22]Though I know you really like
[03:27.66]To see me suffer
[03:39.76]'Cause I miss you, Valentine
[03:45.07]And really loved you
[03:49.87]I really loved you
[03:57.01]I tried so hard
[03:58.27]But you drove me away
[04:01.29]To preserve my sanity
[04:05.78]And I found the strength
[04:08.00]To break away
[04:12.62]Fly?
