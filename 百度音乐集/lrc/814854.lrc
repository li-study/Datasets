[00:06.09]Goodbye My Lover
[00:09.43]James Blunt
[00:10.68]
[00:11.80]Did I disappoint you or let you down?
[00:16.53]Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
[00:21.28]'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
[00:25.44]Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
[00:30.85]So I took what's mine by eternal right.
[00:36.77]Took your soul out into the night.
[00:41.51]It may be over but it won't stop there,
[00:45.67]I am here for you if you'd only care.
[00:50.04]
[00:51.33]You touched my heart you touched my soul.
[00:53.94]You changed my life and all my goals.
[00:56.28]And love is blind and that I knew when,
[00:59.15]My heart was blinded by you.
[01:01.40]I've kissed your lips and held your head.
[01:03.76]Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
[01:06.36]I know you well, I know your smell.
[01:09.25]I've been addicted to you.
[01:11.65]
[01:12.49]Goodbye my lover.
[01:15.00]Goodbye my friend.
[01:17.22]You have been the one.
[01:19.65]You have been the one for me.
[01:22.56]Goodbye my lover.
[01:24.99]Goodbye my friend.
[01:27.31]You have been the one.
[01:29.75]You have been the one for me.
[01:31.95]
[01:37.63]I am a dreamer but when I wake,
[01:42.39]You can't break my spirit
[01:45.04]it's my dreams you take.
[01:47.44]And as you move on, remember me,
[01:52.34]Remember us and all we used to be
[01:55.98]
[01:56.85]I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
[01:59.48]I've watched you sleeping for a while.
[02:01.92]I'd be the father of your child.
[02:04.83]I'd spend a lifetime with you.
[02:07.13]I know your fears and you know mine.
[02:09.50]We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
[02:12.00]And I love you, I swear that's true.
[02:14.96]I cannot live without you.
[02:18.10]Goodbye my lover.
[02:20.57]Goodbye my friend.
[02:22.79]You have been the one.
[02:25.31]You have been the one for me.
[02:28.21]Goodbye my lover.
[02:30.73]Goodbye my friend.
[02:32.94]You have been the one.
[02:35.49]You have been the one for me.
[02:37.74]
[02:48.12]And I still hold your hand in mine.
[02:54.53]In mine when I'm asleep.
[02:58.16]And I will bear my soul in time,
[03:04.55]When I'm kneeling at your feet.
[03:07.60]
[03:08.70]Goodbye my lover.
[03:11.09]Goodbye my friend.
[03:13.34]You have been the one.
[03:15.87]You have been the one for me.
[03:18.83]Goodbye my lover.
[03:21.31]Goodbye my friend.
[03:23.46]You have been the one.
[03:25.90]You have been the one for me.
[03:27.90]I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
[03:30.81]I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
[03:37.47]
[03:38.45]I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
[03:43.43]I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
