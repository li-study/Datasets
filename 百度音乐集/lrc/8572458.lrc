[00:03.07]My home is in motion, 
[00:06.46]as darkness unfolds.
[00:09.84]The air overloaded, 
[00:13.25]the sky's dancing gold.
[00:16.61]But you went away, 
[00:19.97]you left me to stay
[00:23.37]We'll see us in heaven, 
[00:26.83]I'm counting the days 
[00:30.84]
[00:31.84]At the end of time, 
[00:33.62]at the end of us, 
[00:35.24]At the end of everything we had,
[00:38.62]Only faith helps you, 
[00:40.32]only grace can do
[00:41.94]Only you can take the pain
[00:45.40]Cause the end of peace is the end of life 
[00:48.69]and the end of any happiness
[00:52.12]Only love helps you, 
[00:53.79]only trust can do
[00:55.46]Only you can take the pain of me
[01:00.49]
[01:54.76]When thunder is calling I feel so alive
[02:01.53]The very first morning, 
[02:04.85]can you see the light?
[02:08.28]But you closed the door to what I adored
[02:14.94]We'll see us in heaven, 
[02:18.44]I'm counting no more 
[02:23.54]At the end of time, 
[02:25.42]at the end of us, 
[02:26.80]At the end of everything we had,
[02:30.25]Only faith helps you, 
[02:31.88]only grace can do
[02:33.56]Only you can take the pain
[02:36.95]Cause the end of peace is the end of life 
[02:40.36]and the end of any happiness
[02:43.79]Only love helps you, 
[02:45.49]only trust can do
[02:47.18]Only you can take the pain of me
