[00:06.06]- Helen Reddy
[00:10.06]
[00:12.35]Time
[00:14.54]You found time enough to love
[00:19.03]And I found love enough to hold you
[00:23.98]So tonight
[00:26.16]I'll stir the fire you feel inside
[00:30.50]Until the flames of love enfold you
[00:35.78]Laying beside you lost in the feeling
[00:41.81]So glad you opened my door
[00:45.82]Come with me
[00:50.04]Somewhere in the night we will know
[00:55.88]Everything lovers can know
[00:59.98]You're my song
[01:04.23]Music too magic to end
[01:08.92]I'll play you over and over again
[01:15.36]Loving so warm
[01:18.21]Moving so right
[01:21.01]Closing our eyes and feeling alive
[01:26.54]We'll just go on burning bright
[01:30.72]Somewhere in the night
[01:34.47]
[01:43.56]You'll sleep
[01:46.60]When the morning comes
[01:50.66]And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
[01:55.08]And you'll smile
[01:57.87]When you dream about the night
[02:01.69]Like it's a secret you've been keeping
[02:06.88]Laying beside you lost in the feeling
[02:12.93]So glad you opened my door
[02:16.53]Come with me
[02:20.69]Somewhere in the night we will know
[02:26.30]Everything lovers can know
[02:30.56]You're my song
[02:34.67]Music too magic to end
[02:39.38]I'll play you over and over again
[02:45.89]Loving so warm
[02:48.58]Moving so right
[02:51.34]Closing our eyes and feeling alive
[02:56.90]We'll just go on burning bright
[03:01.09]Somewhere in the night
[03:02.46]Loving so warm
[03:05.22]Moving so right
[03:08.02]Closing our eyes and feeling alive
[03:13.54]We'll just go on burning bright
[03:17.75]Somewhere in the night
[03:19.04]We'll just go on burning bright
[03:23.30]Somewhere in the night
