[ti:IMMORTALITY]
[ar:pearl jam]

[00:30.00]Vacate is the word...vengeance has no place so near to her
[00:37.00]Cannot find the comfort in this world
[00:44.00]Artificial tear...vessel stabbed...next up, volunteers
[00:52.00]Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere...
[01:00.00]A truant finds home...and a wish to hold on...
[01:07.00]But there's a trapdoor in the sun...immortality...
[01:31.00]As privileged as a whore...victims in demand for public show
[01:39.00]Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
[01:46.00]Holier than thou, how?
[01:50.00]Surrendered...executed anyhow
[01:54.00]Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor...
[02:01.00]A truant finds home...and a wish to hold on to...
[02:08.00]But saw the trapdoor in the sun...
[03:09.00]Immortality...
[03:17.00]I cannot stop the thought...I'm running in the dark...
[03:25.00]Coming up a which way sign...all good truants must decide...
[03:32.00]Oh, stripped and sold, mom...auctioned forearm...
[03:40.00]And whiskers in the sink...
[03:44.00]Truants move on...cannot stay long
[03:51.00]Some die just to live...
[03:55.00]Ohh...
