[00:04.00]Story Of The Year - Holding On To You
[00:05.51]
[00:10.83]Another year is gone so fast
[00:15.49]Another life becomes the past
[00:19.74]Under the weight of dreams
[00:22.58]That I never thought would last
[00:26.72]Feelings clash
[00:29.52]And set a light across the globe
[00:33.71]This window seat becomes my home
[00:38.34]I lie awake for hours
[00:41.84]Staring at the world below
[00:49.39]
[00:52.50]Into the ways again I go
[00:58.29]Holding on to you
[01:02.05]I found a way to make it through
[01:07.31]By holding on to you
[01:10.70]
[01:11.41]Another night has slipped away
[01:15.80]Wishing the time would let me stay
[01:20.23]Stuck in between two lives
[01:23.14]That could never be the same
[01:27.30]I remain without a chance
[01:31.66]To say to you that every word I said was true
[01:39.08]I lie awake all night just staring back at you
[01:47.78]
[01:48.55]Into the ways again I go
[01:54.22]Holding on to you
[01:57.89]I found a way to make it through
[02:03.48]Holding on to you
[02:08.08]
[02:08.77]Just one more day will make it through
[02:14.60]Will you still feel the same way that I do?
[02:25.02]That I do ?
[02:29.60]
[02:30.79]Noo
[02:33.20]You feel the same way I do
[02:38.00]Holding on to you
[02:40.37]Noo
[02:45.34]
[02:46.85]Into the ways again I go
[02:52.39]Holding on to you
[02:56.40]I found a way to make it through
[03:01.78]Holding on to you
[03:05.51]Into the ways again I go
[03:10.94]Holding on to you
[03:14.95]I found a way to make it through
[03:20.00]So I'm holding on to you
[03:25.32]Just one more day will make it through
[03:32.70]Will make it through
[03:37.85]
