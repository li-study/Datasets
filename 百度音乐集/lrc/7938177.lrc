[00:04.91]
[00:05.95]Why does blood turn brown when it dries and
[00:08.31]Why do the tears well up in your eyes?
[00:10.95]Why didn't I learn to ride my bike
[00:13.49]When it was warm and sunny outside?
[00:16.22]
[00:16.69]Why can't little kids tie their shoes and then
[00:19.14]Why can't the white people play the blues?
[00:22.03]Why can't I fall in love with you?
[00:24.45]It must be because of the seasons.
[00:26.81]When the leaves start falling from the trees,
[00:32.39]When the birds start flirting with the bees,
[00:37.69]When the wind starts blowing from the East to the West;
[00:43.42]Maybe you'll be the one that I like best.
[00:47.38]
[00:51.26]Clouds start forming I can't complain,
[00:53.57]'Cause I think we might be in need of some rain.
[00:56.50]When it starts pouring
[00:57.99]Don't hide away without me.
[01:00.76]
[01:01.92]Bought an umbrella big enough for two,
[01:04.15]But it feels pretty empty under here without you.
[01:06.98]Dry as a bone but I'm still alone
[01:09.60]I'm so grey..
[01:12.02]When you're standing in a puddle with wet feet;
[01:17.38]And your head is sore from pounding drops of sleet.
[01:22.82]When the cold and lonely hours put your heart to the test..
[01:28.32]Maybe I'll be the one that you like best.
[01:32.68]
[01:54.26]When the leaves start falling from the trees,
[01:59.82]When the birds start flirting with the bees,
[02:05.21]When the wind starts blowing from the East to the West;
[02:10.76]Maybe you'll be the one that I like best.
[02:14.69]
[02:16.12]If the sky should open its eyes
[02:20.87]And cry from up above..
[02:26.49]Let's shed some tears of joy
[02:29.18]And fall in love
