[00:00.00]CHILDHOOD     (Theme from "Free Willy 2")
[00:00.34]Have you seen my Childhood?
[00:05.50]I'm searching for the world that I come from
[00:11.64]'Cause I've been looking around
[00:15.43]In the lost and found of my heart...
[00:22.80]No one understands me
[00:29.50]They view it as such strange eccentricities...
[00:35.85]'Cause I keep kidding around
[00:39.97]Like a child, but pardon me...
[00:48.91]People say I'm not okay
[00:54.11]'Cause I love such elementary things...
[01:00.41]It's been my fate to compensate,
[01:06.06]for the Childhood
[01:12.80]I've never known...
[01:20.03]Have you seen my Childhood?
[01:25.40]I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
[01:30.63]Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
[01:35.72]Of conquest and kings on the throne...
[01:38.32]
[01:43.80]Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
[01:53.81]Look within your heart then ask,
[02:07.36]Have you seen my Childhood?
[02:13.39]
[02:37.15]People say I'm strange that way
[02:42.97]'Cause I love such elementary things,
[02:50.44]It's been my fate to compensate,
[02:56.26]for the Childhood I've never known...
[03:12.89]Have you seen my Childhood?
[03:18.78]I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
[03:23.83]Like fantastical stories to share
[03:29.17]The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
[03:37.20]Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
[03:48.22]The painful youth I've had
[04:04.86]Have you seen my Childhood.
