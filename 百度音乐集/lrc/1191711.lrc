[00:51.36]Black spots floating before my eye
[00:57.11]Solar wind shouting from the sky
[01:02.20]Free of chains, free from pains
[01:07.87]Old poisons run in my veins
[01:13.00]
[01:13.68]Airborne I'm speeding in flames
[01:18.82]Dark wings growing from my heels
[01:24.66]I make the rules to my games
[01:30.20]Back in the fire with burning wheels
[01:38.19]
[01:39.77]Born from the fires of the core
[01:44.53]My home is in the red hot gore
[01:50.78]I'm this blade and I'm the truth
[01:54.92]I'm alive, the everlasting youth

[02:01.17]Airborne I'm speeding in flames
[02:06.32]Dark wings growing from my heels
[02:12.09]I make the rules to my games
[02:18.28]Back in the fire with burning wheels
[02:23.91]
[03:45.02]Walls of my prison have gone
[03:51.16]I hear the shadows whisper and warm
[03:56.24]White heat against your black
[04:01.17]Battles to come and I am back
[04:06.15]
[04:07.30]Airborne I'm speeding in flames
[04:12.42]Dark wings growing from my heels
[04:18.17]I make the rules to my games
[04:23.62]Back in the fire with burning wheels
[05:14.73]Back in the Fire,
[05:16.35]Back in the Fire,
[05:19.48]Back in the Fire!
