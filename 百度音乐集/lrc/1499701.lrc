[00:27.17]Now I really cannot see
[00:32.52]If you were good for me at all
[00:36.94]I wanna say, that everything’s fine
[00:40.75]But it’s not… but it’s not
[00:47.73]All the times you made me stay
[00:52.98][02:02.41]I see it all so clear today
[00:56.36]And I wish I could
[01:00.81]Turn back time… turn back time
[01:09.36][01:19.52][02:18.59][02:28.88][03:33.02][03:43.32][03:53.64][04:03.87]If I had a choice
[01:14.09][02:23.50][03:37.98][03:58.38]I’d leave all behind
[01:24.23][02:33.59][03:48.11][04:08.58]I’d make you leave my mind
[01:29.21][02:38.55][04:13.52]Leave my mind
[01:36.79]The things you had me do
[01:41.96]Everytime you knew I would
[01:46.34]I wanna say, that I was aware
[01:50.01]But I can’t… but I can’t
[01:57.03]All you tried to take away
[02:05.74]And I feel like a fool
[02:10.13]I let myself down… let myself down
[02:48.52][02:58.63]And you begged me to trust you
[02:53.84][03:04.14]I wish I never did
[04:16.36]
