[00:08.12]You broke his arm in Houston
[00:11.75]His rib in Santa Fe
[00:15.20]Then you drug him through the dirt in San Antone
[00:23.02]And last year out in Vegas you almost took him all the way
[00:30.35]Then you sent him broke and busted right back home
[00:37.53]No matter how hard you throw him
[00:41.26]He just gets back on again
[00:45.28]Oh I'll never understand this crazy hold you have on him
[00:52.11]
[00:52.40]Rodeo, Rodeo
[00:59.98]Are you every gonna let my cowboy go?
[01:07.51]You've got a hundred other men
[01:11.49]You don't give a damn bout him
[01:15.26]But he still loves you
[01:17.49]Why? I don't know
[01:22.14]Rodeo, Rodeo
[01:28.60]
[01:30.41]From an empty cold hotel room
[01:34.05]In some state you left him in
[01:37.55]He'll call and tell me that this time he's really through
[01:45.27]Iâ€™ll get to hold him through the winter
[01:48.79]But when spring rolls round again
[01:52.87]He'll jump in his truck and run right back to you
[02:00.80]You steal his love away from me
[02:04.15]8 Seconds at a time
[02:07.93]Even when I'm in his arm I know your still on his mind
[02:14.87]Rodeo, Rodeo
[02:22.92]Are you every gonna let my cowboy go?
[02:30.16]You've got a hundred other men
[02:34.19]You don't give a damn bout him
[02:37.86]oh But he still loves you
[02:40.00]Why? I don't know
[02:44.66]Rodeo, Rodeo
[02:50.76]
[02:52.70]If you were just another women
[02:56.22]Maybe I'll know what to do
[02:59.72]He might give his heart to me
[03:02.96]But he'd give his life for you
[03:07.45]Rodeo
[03:13.17]
[03:22.54]You've got a hundred other men
[03:26.49]You don't give a damn bout him
[03:30.33]oh But he still loves you
[03:32.52]Why? I'll never know
