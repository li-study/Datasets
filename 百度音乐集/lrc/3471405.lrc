[00:12]                               Unbelievable
[00:14]                      You burden me with your questions
[00:16]                      You'd have me tell no lies
[00:18]                      You're always asking what it's all about
[00:20]                      Now listen to my replies
[00:23]                      You say to me I don't talk enough
[00:25]                      But when I do I'm a fool
[00:27]                      These times I've spent, I've realized
[00:29]                      I'm going to shoot through
[00:31]                      And leave you
[00:32]                      The things, you say
[00:34]                      Your purple prose just gives you away
[00:36]                      The things, you say
[00:40]                      You're unbelievable
[00:50]                      You burden me with your problems
[00:53]                      By telling me more than mine
[00:55]                      I'm always so concerned
[00:57]                      With the way you say,
[00:58]                      You've always go to stop
[01:00]                      To think of us being one
[01:01]                      Is more than I ever know
[01:04]                      But this time, I realize
[01:06]                      I'm going to shoot through
[01:08]                      And leave you
[01:37]                      Seemingly lastless, don't mean
[01:38]                      you can ask us
[01:39]                      Pushing down the relative
[01:40]                      Bringing out your higher self
[01:41]                      Think of the fine times, pushing
[01:42]                      down the better few, instead of
[01:44]                      bringing out the clues, to what the
[01:46]                      world and everything anger to, brace
[01:48]                      yourself with the grace of ease,
[01:53]                      I know this world ain't what it seems.
[03:24]                      What the fuck was that,
[03:26]                      its unbelievable
