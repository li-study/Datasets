[00:07.64]Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
[00:15.50]And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
[00:23.17]Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin, to make a fire grow
[00:30.64]And baby you,ve got what it takes
[00:38.26]You know it takes a lot of kissin,
[00:42.27](Tell me about it)
[00:42.95]To make a romance sweet
[00:45.72]Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin, to make my life complete
[00:53.92]Mmm, and it takes somebody special to knock me off my feet
[02:32.42][01:47.09][01:01.00]And baby, you,ve got what it takes.
[01:08.08]I said,
[01:08.98]Mm, mm, mm. uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
[01:52.57][01:15.73]Ah, ah, hah
[01:16.56]Mm, mm
[01:20.84]You know you,ve got just what it takes!
[02:09.29][01:23.88]Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
[02:16.79][01:30.60]It,d take more than a lifetime to prove that I,ll be true
[02:24.48][01:38.65]But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do."
[01:54.95]Mm, mm, uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
[02:01.43]Mmm
[02:06.30]You know you,ve got just what it takes
[02:40.20]And baby, you've got what it takes.
[02:52.70][02:47.87]And baby, you've got what it takes
