[00:17.26]Beauty is what the eyes behold
[00:22.25]And you burn brighter than most
[00:26.85]I chased you thru the midnight streets
[00:31.75]To be where I could speak freely
[00:37.33]I didn’t care what tomorrow held
[00:42.19]I felt the world turning only for us
[00:47.25]Only bliss now for you and me
[00:52.35]Rise up let life’s kiss send us reeling
[02:00.85][00:58.11]
[03:41.98][02:01.42][00:59.23]And unlike the times before
[03:46.70][02:06.36][01:04.45]From yesterday comes tomorrow
[03:51.79][02:11.54][01:09.37]When life comes alive the past moves aside
[03:56.98][02:16.70][01:14.54]No regrets and no remorse
[01:22.81]
[01:39.15]We have more than everything
[01:44.39]More than man or machine
[01:49.42]More than luck
[01:51.17]More than fiction
[01:54.44]Higher than any religion
[02:20.71]
[02:21.33]We’ll squeeze the blood out of life
[02:24.51]And say goodnight to the silver of old
[02:31.09]Even when wrong we’re right
[02:35.26]Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
[02:41.45]I’ve come to realize
[02:44.83]Where happiness lies
[02:49.06]I want you to know I know
[03:00.03]
