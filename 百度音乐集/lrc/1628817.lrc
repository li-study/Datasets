[00:13.18]We remember the days,
[00:15.99]We sat out together with faith?
[00:21.06]Remember the times, so fine,
[00:24.16]When we thought that nothing could stand in our way?
[00:28.98]Then things weren't the same,
[00:32.09]The life that we knew had to change
[00:36.99]We've struggled through the darkest storms,
[00:41.03]We thought we couldn't tame
[00:45.01]Together we've tried,
[00:48.19]As we stood side by side
[00:52.17]I knew we'd build a new world,
[00:55.07]A world of hope forever after
[01:00.27]Deep in my heart I just know,
[01:04.24]right from the start we will grow
[01:08.34]Look where we are,
[01:10.10]we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
[01:16.02]All of my heart, I will care.
[01:20.13]I'll play my part, I will share
[01:23.99]With family and friends,together we'll stand
[01:28.07]And in the end, hand in hand,
[01:32.42]We will get there
[01:34.53]
[01:49.03]So now we begin, working together to win
[01:57.28]Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything.
[02:05.08]There's so much to do,
[02:08.25]There's so much we can contribute
[02:13.14]By sharing just a little love,
[02:17.15]We will start again a new
[02:21.13]So why don't we try?
[02:24.53]If we stand side by side
[02:28.38]I know we'll build a new world,
[02:31.20]A world of hope for ever after
[02:36.44]Deep in my heart I just know,
[02:40.30]right from the start we will grow
[02:44.13]Look where we are,
[02:46.23]we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
[02:52.16]All of my heart, I will care.
[02:56.22]I'll play my part, I will share
[03:00.18]With family and friends,together we'll stand
[03:04.12]And in the end, hand in hand,
[03:08.26]We will get there
[03:09.14]Deep in my heart I just know,
[03:12.20]right from the start we will grow
[03:16.18]Look where we are,
[03:18.09]we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
[03:24.08]All of my heart, I will care.
