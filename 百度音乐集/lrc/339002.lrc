[00:16.96]Girl you know i miss you so
[00:23.99]I didn't know you had to go
[00:30.61]You've had enough of our distance baby
[00:34.24]Before I had the chance to say
[00:37.23]I'm staying with you
[00:40.61]For the rest of my life
[00:44.62]
[02:03.75][00:46.35]Don't keep telling me these words
[02:11.14][00:53.60]You don't know how much it hurts
[02:17.53][00:59.88]And I'll promise you eternity
[02:21.18][01:03.63]if you promise me your stay
[02:24.18][01:06.70]But now it's too late
[02:27.54][01:10.16]I'm no longer the man that I was
[02:31.95][01:15.65]
[02:33.18][01:17.49]I will go on without her
[03:21.04][02:38.65][01:21.15]Like a fool who's too sure
[03:25.06][02:42.74][01:25.41]I'm like a brid who's lost her wing
[03:29.57][02:47.22][01:29.66]A fire without its flame
[03:32.22][02:49.86][01:32.27]I don't know how to be strong
[03:35.72][02:53.38][01:35.84]When my love has to move on
[03:39.95][02:57.51][01:40.05]I am a song without a soul
[03:43.71][03:01.23][01:43.81]Now that she's gone
[03:46.24][03:03.82][01:46.36]What's left of us is this song
[03:07.73][01:50.63]
[03:09.59]Oh yes I know I don't know
[03:13.24]baby i am konw i am a soul
[03:16.84]And I will go on without her
[03:51.00]This is our song without a soul
[03:55.60]Now that you're gone
[03:57.98]What's left of us in this song
[04:07.31]
