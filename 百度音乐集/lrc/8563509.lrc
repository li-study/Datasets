[03:53.00]I Will Come To You
[03:12.00][01:08.00][00:14.00]When you have no light to guide you
[03:15.00][01:12.00][00:17.00]And no one to walk to walk beside you

[02:12.00]Oh I will come to you
[02:17.00]We all need somebody we can turn to
[02:24.00]Someone who'll always understand
[02:32.00]So if you feel that your soul is dyin'
[02:35.00]And you need the strength to keep tryin'
