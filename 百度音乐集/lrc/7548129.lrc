[00:00.00]Maroon 5 - Nothing Lasts Forever
[00:04.00]
[00:10.52]It is so easy to see
[00:12.62]Dysfunction between you and me
[00:15.12]We must free up these tired souls
[00:17.64]Before the sadness kills us both
[00:19.78]
[00:20.29]I tried and tried to let you know
[00:22.76]I love you but I\'m letting go
[00:25.17]It may not last but I don\'t know
[00:27.77]Just don\'t know
[00:28.93]
[00:30.03]If you don\'t know
[00:31.24]Then you can\'t care
[00:32.59]And I show up
[00:33.80]But you\'re not there
[00:35.07]But I\'m waiting
[00:36.34]And you want to
[00:37.43]Still afraid that I will desert you
[00:39.79]
[00:40.20]Everyday
[00:42.60]With every word whispered we get more far away
[00:47.56]The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
[00:52.78]But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
[00:57.93]It hurts but it may be the only way
[01:00.43]
[01:05.22]A babe that\'s warm with memories
[01:07.53]Can heal us temporarily
[01:09.91]The misbehaving all he makes
[01:12.57]The ditch between us so damn deep
[01:14.96]
[01:15.42]Built a wall around my heart
[01:17.75]Never let it fall apart
[01:20.29]Strangely I wish secretly
[01:22.65]It won\'t fall down while I\'m asleep
[01:25.22]
[01:25.26]If you don\'t know
[01:26.54]Then you can\'t care
[01:27.77]And I show up
[01:28.97]But you\'re not there
[01:30.25]But I\'m waiting
[01:31.49]And you want to
[01:32.60]Still afraid that I will desert you, babe
[01:35.71]
[01:35.78]Everyday
[01:37.95]With every word whispered we get more far away
[01:42.85]The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
[01:47.82]But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
[01:52.75]It hurts but it may be the only way
[01:55.62]
[01:56.25]But we have not hit the ground
[01:58.68]Doesn\'t mean we\'re not still falling, oh
[02:05.43]I want for mine to pick you up
[02:07.68]But you\'re still too reluctant to accept my help
[02:12.24]What a shame, I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
[02:17.77]But until then the fact remains
[02:19.94]
[02:20.41]Everyday
[02:22.71]With every word whispered we get more far away
[02:28.01]The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
[02:32.83]Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
[02:37.91]It hurts but it may be the only way
[02:40.48]
[02:40.75]Everyday
