[00:07.04]Is it love tonight
[00:12.44]When everyone's dreaming
[00:16.17]Of a better life
[00:19.48]
[00:21.16]In this world
[00:24.55]Divided by fear
[00:28.61]We've gotta believe that
[00:32.33]There's a reason we're here
[00:36.65]There's a reason we're here
[00:39.94]
[00:46.31]'Cause these are the days worth livin'
[00:50.68]These are the years we're given
[00:54.97]And these are the moments
[00:57.09]These are the times
[00:59.11]Let's make the best out of our lives
[01:02.87]
[01:03.32]See the truth all around
[01:09.02]Our faith can be broken
[01:12.44]And our hands can be bound
[01:16.91]But open our hearts
[01:21.06]And fill up the emptyness
[01:25.29]With nothing to stop us
[01:28.73]Is it not worth the risk?
[01:32.19]Is it not worth the risk?
[01:36.66]
[01:43.08]'Cause these are the days worth livin'
[01:47.25]These are the years we're given
[01:51.50]And these are the moments
[01:53.29]These are the times
[01:55.39]Let's make the best out of our lives
[01:59.49]Even if hope was shattered
[02:03.63]I know it wouldn't matter
[02:07.46]'Cause these are the moments
[02:09.60]These are the times
[02:11.65]Let's make the best out of our lives
[02:17.24]We can't go wrong
[02:21.10]Thinking it's wrong
[02:23.29]To speak our minds
[02:26.00]I've gotta let out what's inside
[02:31.07]
[02:31.97]Is it love tonight
[02:37.54]When everyone's dreaming
[02:41.04]But can we get it right?
[02:45.06]Yeah but can we get it right?
[02:47.58]
[02:48.05]'Cause these are the days worth livin'
[02:51.84]These are the years we're given
[02:55.83]And these are the moments
[02:57.85]These are the times
[02:59.79]Let's make the best out of our lives
[03:04.01]Even if hope was SHATTERED
[03:07.99]I know it wouldn't matter
[03:11.86]'Cause these are the moments
[03:14.12]These are the times
[03:16.20]Let's make the best out of our lives
[03:24.18]Let's make the best out of our lives
[03:32.38]Let's make the best out of our lives
