[00:17.82]I walk alone
[00:20.45]Think of home
[00:22.81]Memories of long ago
[00:26.46]No one knows I lost my soul long ago
[00:34.78]Lie too much
[00:38.57]She said that she's had enough
[00:42.80]Am I too much
[00:46.68]She said that she's had enough
[00:50.66]Standing on my own
[00:53.71]Remembering the one I left at home
[00:57.92]Forget about the life I used to know
[01:01.94]Forget about the one I left at home
[01:07.62]I need to run far away
[01:11.92]Can't go back to that place
[01:16.08]Like she told me
[01:19.04]I'm just a big disgrace
[01:24.03]Lie too much
[01:27.63]She said that she's had enough
[01:32.35]Am I too much
[01:35.91]She said that she's had enough
[01:40.00]Standing on my own
[01:42.86]Remembering the one I left at home
[01:47.07]Forget about the life I used to know
[01:51.14]Forget about the one I left at home
[01:55.16]So now I'm standing here alone
[01:59.42]I'm learning how to live life on my own
[02:05.33]Lie too much
[02:08.68]I think that I've had enough
[02:13.07]Am I too much
[02:16.86]She said that she's had enough
[02:21.00]I'm standing on my own
[02:24.10]Remembering the one I left at home
[02:28.12]Forget about the life I used to know
[02:32.23]Forget about the one I left at home
[02:36.20]So now I'm standing here alone
[02:40.41]I'm learning how to live life on my own
[02:44.52]Forget about the past I'll never know
[02:48.54]Forget about the one I left at home
