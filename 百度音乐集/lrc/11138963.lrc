[00:04.96]
[00:14.17]These days you barely even say my name
[00:18.30]Like you don't really feel the same
[00:21.25]I'm wondering what's to blame
[00:24.82]These nights I fall asleep wondering where you are
[00:29.64]It feels like we're falling apart
[00:32.36]And it's only breaking my heart
[00:35.82]Cause if being with you means being alone
[00:38.87]And never knowing when you're coming home
[00:41.70]Then I guess I'm better off on my own
[00:44.70]
[00:46.44]But I can't move on
[00:48.92]Cause that makes forgetting
[00:51.06]Forgetting everything we've had
[00:54.63]Instead I keep coming
[00:56.57]keep coming
[00:57.78]I keep running back
[01:00.01]Cause I keep forgetting
[01:01.93]Forgetting you treat me so bad
[01:05.42]So I keep coming
[01:07.81]keep coming
[01:09.65]I keep running back
[01:11.03]I keep coming back
[01:13.10]I keep coming back
[01:15.80]I keep coming back
[01:18.63]I keep coming back
[01:21.04]
[01:23.56]My friends say that I should leave you behind
[01:27.90]And stop wasting all my time
[01:31.05]They tell me that I am out of my mind
[01:34.60]But I know that what we both share is real
[01:39.27]And I've been willing to deal
[01:42.10]With the way that you're making me feel
[01:45.17]
[01:45.68]Cause if being with you means being alone
[01:48.61]And never knowing when you're coming home
[01:51.47]Then I guess I'm better off on my own
[01:54.27]
[01:56.32]But I can't move on
[01:58.67]Cause that makes me forgetting
[02:00.75]Forgetting everything we've had
[02:04.23]Instead I keep coming
[02:06.41]keep coming
[02:07.66]I keep running back
[02:09.84]Cause I keep forgetting
[02:12.05]Forgetting you treat me so bad
[02:15.38]So I keep coming
[02:17.48]Keep coming
[02:19.18]I keep running back
[02:20.86]I keep coming back
[02:22.82]I keep coming back
[02:25.54]I keep coming back
[02:28.32]I keep coming back
