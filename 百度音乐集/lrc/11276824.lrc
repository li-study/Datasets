[00:04.60]
[00:06.60]A well I bless my soul
[00:08.08]What's wrong with me?
[00:10.08]I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
[00:13.23]My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
[00:16.10]I'm in love
[00:18.08]I'm all shook up
[00:19.33]Mm mm, yeah, yeah!
[00:25.00]
[00:25.79]My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
[00:29.25]I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
[00:32.46]Who do you thank when you have such luck?
[00:35.41]I'm in love
[00:37.42]I'm all shook up
[00:38.68]Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
[00:44.41]
[00:45.25]Well please don't ask me what's hold on my mind
[00:48.49]I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
[00:51.84]When I'm near that girl that I love best
[00:54.99]My heart beats so it scares me to death!
[01:29.95][00:57.93]She touched my hand what a chill I got
[01:33.17][01:01.40]Her lips are like a vulcano that's hot
[01:36.33][01:04.48]I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
[01:39.12][01:07.38]I'm in love

[01:48.26][01:42.40][01:10.53]Mm mm, yeah, yeah!
[01:16.56]
[01:17.36]My tongue get tied when I try to speak
[01:20.45]My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
[01:23.65]There's only one cure for this body of mine
[01:26.64]That's to have that girl that I love so fine!
