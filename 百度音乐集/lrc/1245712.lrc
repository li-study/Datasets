[00:22.87]I was sitting here thinkin' 'bout my situation
[00:25.96]Though I know you got reservations
[00:28.88]I was thinkin' we could have it out
[00:30.93]'Cause if we had it out
[00:32.14]I knew that we could work things out
[00:34.26]I know the girlies gotta watch their reputations
[00:37.01]They like to know they got a man with dedication
[00:39.63]To make a point they gotta put 'em out, but truly
[00:42.23]Baby girl don't have to go out that route
[00:45.19]So don't think I don't love you baby
[00:47.99]So don't think I ain't been goin' crazy
[00:50.78]Don't think for one minute
[00:52.76]You ain't been on my mind
[00:55.66]Don't think that I'm gone for good
[00:58.25]Lord knows that I've been misunderstood
[01:01.49]Won't give you up and baby I'll tell you why
[01:05.67]I ain't never been down
[01:08.37]I ain't never been out
[01:11.46]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[01:14.14]Till the day you put me out
[01:16.89]And I know I've done some wrong
[01:22.38]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[01:25.47]So baby don't count me out
[01:27.87]I was thinkin' in the mornin' it'd be over when I wake up
[01:31.40]But then reality had hit me and I jumped up
[01:34.22]I had to get myself a dial tone
[01:36.29]I started callin' everybody tryin' to get back home
[01:39.54]But everybody that I called was being difficult
[01:42.18]I took it personal and took it as an insult
[01:45.04]For all the time we had been goin' out
[01:47.18]Girl I don't understand why you would have to go that route
[01:50.53]Well I know that I love you baby
[01:53.15]And I know that I'm goin' crazy
[01:55.87]Don't think for one minute
[01:57.98]You ain't been on my mind
[02:01.04]Don't think I'm gone for good
[02:03.55]Gods knows that I've been misunderstood
[02:06.70]I won't give you up and baby I'll tell you why
[02:10.93]I ain't never been down
[02:13.66]I ain't never been out
[02:16.73]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[02:19.39]Till the day you put me out
[02:22.20]And I know I've done some wrong
[02:27.66]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[02:30.76]So baby don't count me out
[02:33.03]I ain't never been down
[02:35.49]I ain't never been out
[02:38.58]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[02:41.22]Till the day you put me out
[02:43.99]And I know I've done some wrong
[02:49.49]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[02:52.81]So baby don't count me out
[02:54.81]It's been much too long
[02:57.36]Since you've been gone away from me
[03:00.83]And I need you home
[03:03.25]Oh come back to me baby
[03:06.20]'Cause I'm all alone
[03:07.66]I'm all alone down on my bending knees
[03:11.47]Oh baby, baby
[03:14.58]Can I come back home please
[03:16.76]I ain't never been down
[03:18.92]I ain't never been out
[03:22.07]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[03:24.80]Till the day you put me out
[03:27.54]And I know I've done some wrong
[03:33.00]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[03:36.13]So baby don't count me out
[03:38.07]I ain't never been down
[03:40.74]I ain't never been out
[03:43.93]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[03:46.79]Till the day you put me out
[03:49.32]And I know I've done some wrong
[03:54.78]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[03:58.21]So baby don't count me out
[03:59.95]I ain't never been down
[04:02.58]I ain't never been out
[04:05.63]And I ain't never hit rock bottom
[04:08.41]Till the day you put me out
[04:11.10]And I know I've done some wrong
[04:16.77]But I ain't never hit rock bottom
[04:25.20]ZYK我永远爱你!!
