[00:00.00]Leave Right Now
[00:05.68]By Will Young
[00:09.91]
[00:11.25]I'm here just like I said
[00:16.76]Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
[00:22.20]My racing heart is just the same
[00:28.40]Why make it strong to break it once again?
[00:33.93]
[00:35.87]And I'd love to say I do
[00:39.14]Give everything to you
[00:41.74]But I can never now be true
[00:45.04]So I say...
[00:46.70]
[02:41.50][01:45.79][00:47.50]I think I'd better leave right now
[02:44.33][01:48.88][00:50.46]Before I fall any deeper
[03:08.25][02:47.07][01:51.45][00:52.95]I think I'd better leave right now
[03:10.54][02:50.52][01:54.75][00:56.35]Feeling weaker and weaker
[03:13.60][02:53.10][01:57.21][00:58.82]Somebody better show me how
[03:16.90][02:56.07][02:00.48][01:01.87]Before I fall any deeper
[03:19.41][02:58.91][02:03.32][01:05.03]I think I'd better leave right now
[01:08.20]
[01:09.50]I'm here so please explain
[01:15.23]Why you're opening up a healing wound again
[01:20.54]I'm a little more careful
[01:23.73]Perhaps it shows
[01:26.67]But if I lose the highs,
[01:28.89]at least I'm spared the lows
[01:33.22]
[01:34.24]Now I tremble in your arms
[01:38.06]What could be the harm
[01:40.56]To feel my spirit calm
[01:43.79]So I say..
[02:05.90]
[02:06.73]I wouldn't know how to say
[02:08.75]How good it feels seeing you today
[02:12.12]I see you've got your smile back
[02:14.95]Like you say your right on track
[02:17.43]But you may never know why
[02:20.80]Once bitten twice is shy
[02:23.24]If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
[02:26.62]I couldn't bear to lose you again
[02:33.08]
[03:05.40]Yes I will...
