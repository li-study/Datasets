[00:01.12]Cartel - Deep South
[00:05.89]
[00:15.84]I was born in the south
[00:19.09]Given to a town raised on handsome mouth
[00:23.24]Born on the same day as the sun
[00:27.22]Holding in the Earth, seen one by one
[00:30.82]
[00:31.14]A dot in the cold, waiting to rot
[00:35.17]Frozen like stone, all is for not
[00:39.24]All that I am is churning inside
[00:43.22]All that I am is screaming...
[00:46.82]
[00:47.12]Go and get my bones
[00:50.18]Bring 'em to the deep south
[00:53.55]Yeah somewhere they can thaw out
[00:56.97]Here in the deep south
[01:02.77]Go and get my bones
[01:06.31]Bring 'em to the deep south
[01:09.46]Oh yeah somewhere they can thaw out
[01:14.20]Here in the deep south
[01:19.35]
[01:23.98]I feel it in my skin
[01:27.19]Coming undone again and again
[01:31.30]Torn at the seam my heart is sewn
[01:35.31]Holding back the tears shed on my own
[01:38.81]
[01:39.19]If dying is bold, then courage I've got
[01:43.39]I could grow old, but I forgot
[01:47.29]All that I am is churning inside
[01:51.22]The voice in my head is screaming...
[01:55.00]
[01:55.36]Go and get my bones
[01:58.20]Bring 'em to the deep south
[02:01.59]Yeah somewhere they can thaw out
[02:06.03]Here in the deep south
[02:10.94]Go and get my bones

[02:47.18]Given to a town raised on handsome mouth
[02:51.23]Born on the same day as the sun
[02:55.20]Counting every heart beat one by one
[02:58.80]
