[00:58]This is the time when you need a friend
[01:02]You just need someone near
[01:06]I'm not looking forward to the night I'll spend
[01:10]Thinking of you when you're not here
[01:14]How many times will I think about the things
[01:19]I'd like to do
[01:22]Always denied the right to live my life the way I want
[01:28]I want to share it with you
[01:34]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[01:37]In my sweet dreams
[01:41]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[01:45]In my sweet dreams
[02:04]I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
[02:07]And I'll write the words you love
[02:12]And what I can't say in a letter
[02:14]Will just have to wait till I get home
[02:19]There's not much time to tell you half the things that I should
[02:27]Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
[02:33]And I'd do it again if I could
[02:38]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[02:41]In my sweet dreams
[02:45]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[02:49]In my sweet dreams
[02:53]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[02:57]In my sweet dreams
[03:01]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[03:04]In my sweet dreams
[03:23]Sleep like a child resting deep
[03:28]You don't know what you give me I keep
[03:32]For these moments alone
[04:21]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[04:25]In my sweet dreams
[04:29]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[04:32]In my sweet dreams
[04:36]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[04:39]In my sweet dreams
[04:44]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[04:47]In my sweet dreams
[04:51]Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
[04:54]In my sweet dreams
[04:59]Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
[05:02]In my sweet dreams
