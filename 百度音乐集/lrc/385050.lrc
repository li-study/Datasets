[00:36.14]I'm walking out of your dream
[00:39.00]
[00:49.81]Take me off that parade
[00:54.82]And place me somewhere
[00:56.65]In yours sense of a shades
[01:00.37]Your night shuts my door
[01:04.75]And I will not dream anymore
[01:08.48]
[01:10.31]See if I can pass by that waiting hand
[01:15.22]If I can pass by that wandering man
[01:20.34]If I can leave to get on
[01:25.28]See that it all makes sense pretty soon
