[00:17.37]You look at me and see the girl
[00:26.71]Who lives inside the golden world
[00:35.01]But don’t believe
[00:39.16]That’s all there is to see
[00:43.97]You’ll never know the real me
[01:05.64]She smiles through a thousand tears
[01:14.66]And harbours adolescent fears
[01:23.32]She dreams of all
[01:27.49]That she can never be
[01:31.92]She wades in insecurity yeah
[01:41.01]And hides herself inside of me
[01:50.48]Don’t say she takes it all for granted
[01:58.53]I’m well aware of all I have
[02:07.02]Don’t think that I am disenchanted
[02:15.14]Please understand
[02:23.92]It seems as though I’ve always been
[02:32.22]Somebody outside looking in
[02:40.90]Well, here I am for all of them to bleed
[02:50.46]But they can’t take my heart from me
[02:59.56]And they can’t bring me to my knees
[03:08.51]They’ll never know the real me
