[05:42.15]The roses in the window box
[05:44.97]Have tilted to one side
[05:48.72]Everything about this house
[05:51.38]Is gonna grow and die
[05:53.76]
[05:54.62]Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day

[07:12.79]And love lies bleeding in my hand
[07:18.27]Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
[07:24.82]I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
[07:28.34]But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
[07:34.18]Love lies bleeding in my hands
[07:38.44]
[08:43.77]And love lies bleeding in my hand
[08:49.50]Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
[08:55.84]I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
[08:59.34]But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
[09:05.00]Love lies bleeding in my hands
