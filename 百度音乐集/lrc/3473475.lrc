[00:05.24]
[00:14.37]I know that you can hear the rhythm of the rain
[00:20.39]Although we're miles apart I know you feel my pain
[00:26.63]I try to be so strong, I try to carry on
[00:32.31]But since you left the sun don't seem to shine
[00:39.51]My tears are falling on the words you wrote to me
[00:45.50]I wish that somehow they could take me where I wanna be
[00:52.06]It seems so long ago, you held me when I cried
[00:57.72]For now I just pretend you're by my side, oh-oh yeah
[01:04.73]Everything that I touch turns to blue
[01:07.97]When I'm living in a world without you
[01:13.11]I'm going crazy baby, I am missing you
[01:17.89]Can't imagine all I go through
[01:20.75]When I'm living in a world without you
[01:25.94]I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too
[01:33.28]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[01:39.03]
[01:42.84]I try to watch a movie but you're all that I can see (all that I can see)
[01:49.10]In my dreams I know I always see you constantly
[01:56.13]But then a dream comes to an end and I'm alone
[02:01.87]And I can't seem to let this feeling go, whoa-oh baby
[02:08.83]Everything that I touch turns to blue
[02:11.88]When I'm living in a world without you
[02:17.08]I'm going crazy baby, I am missing you
[02:21.96]Can't imagine all I go through
[02:24.82]When I'm living in a world without you(can't live without you)
[02:30.01]I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too
[02:37.47]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
[02:40.35]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
[02:49.92]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[02:53.46]
[02:54.18]I try to be so strong, I try to carry on
[02:59.46]But since you left the sun don't seem to shine, whoa-oh-ooh
[03:06.36]Everything that I touch turns to blue
[03:09.53]When I'm living in a world without you(I'm going crazy, missing you baby)
[03:15.42]I'm going crazy baby, I am missing you
[03:19.52]Can't imagine all I go through
[03:22.31]When I'm living in a world without you (a world without you)
[03:27.83]I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too
[03:32.56]
[03:41.66]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (what can I do without you baby)
[03:46.76]Can't imagine all I go through
[03:47.88]When I'm living in a world without you (living without you)
[03:53.23]I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too
[04:00.43]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
[04:06.65]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
[04:12.98]La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[04:21.80]I'm going crazy missing you baby
[04:28.54]Living without you (living without you)
