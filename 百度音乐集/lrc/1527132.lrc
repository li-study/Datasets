[00:19.00]You know, sometimes I feel like
[00:23.00]I gave it my hardest try
[00:28.00]If there's anything
[00:29.00]I lost is on the last rollercoaster ride
[00:41.00]When I get home
[00:48.00]This is what I say
[00:54.00]When my baby asks ?How was your day??
[01:00.00]I say grace
[01:10.00]Took a rock from the garden I made here
[01:14.00]In the back yard with a little love and some care
[01:20.00]I come here when the world gets too crazy
[01:23.00]I come here when I'm just feeling sad
[01:27.00]We all need a place we can go where
[01:30.00]You pick your dreams out of thin air
[01:35.00]I work in this garden of faith every single day
[01:44.00]I say grace for the blue painted sky
[01:53.00]I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
[02:00.00]When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
[02:11.00]I say grace for the love that I have found
[02:17.00]Used to wanna be at the top of ladder
[02:22.00]Even when you leave you just come back down
[02:27.00]When time gets a hold of my horses
[02:32.00]I think I'll just laugh and go for the ride
[02:36.00]Now when I look out my window
[02:39.00]Where I've planted my heart and my soul
[02:44.00]It does a girl a world of good
[02:48.00]To watch her garden grow
[02:51.00]
[02:54.00]I say grace for the blue painted sky
[03:00.00]I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
[03:09.00]When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
[03:18.00]I say grace for the love that I have found
[03:25.00]
[03:26.00]I've been through the hardest of seasons
[03:30.00]Holding my heart in my hand
[03:35.00]And every kinda thought has a reason
[03:39.00]Now I understand?
[03:45.00]When the roof caves in
[03:51.00]Lets the sun shine in
[03:56.00]Life is beautiful
[03:59.00]Now at the end of day
[04:03.00]
[04:06.00]I say grace for the blue painted sky
[04:13.00]I say grace for my lucky stars that shine
[04:22.00]When I look back on the road that I've traveled down
[04:30.00]I say grace for the love that I have found
[04:34.00]
[04:37.00]I say grace (...two time)
[04:56.00]
