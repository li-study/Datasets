[00:01.78]"Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together"
[00:24.18]"I've got some real estate here in my bag"
[00:29.87]So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
[00:39.23]And we walked off to look for America
[00:47.07]"Kathy," I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
[00:58.68]"Michigan seems like a dream to me now"
[01:05.59]It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
[01:10.15]I've gone to look for America
[01:17.33]Laughing on the bus
[01:20.65]Playing games with the faces
[01:22.67]She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
[01:29.67]I said "Be careful his bowtie is really a camera"
[01:40.35]"Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat"
[01:47.00]"We smoked the last one an hour ago"
[01:57.82]So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
[02:06.36]And the moon rose over an open field
[02:16.43]"Kathy, I'm lost," I said, though I knew she was sleeping
[02:21.16]I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
[02:31.72]Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
[02:36.70]They've all gone to look for America
[02:43.01]All gone to look for America
[02:49.10]All gone to look for America
