[00:-0.50]Blink 182 - I Miss You

[00:28.36]
[00:30.36]Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
[00:34.61]The shadow in the background of the morgue
[00:37.82]The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
[00:42.90]We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
[00:46.42]Where you can always find me
[00:49.29]We'll have Halloween on Christmas
[00:51.82]And in the night we'll wish this never ends
[00:55.06]We'll wish this never ends
[00:57.54]
[01:04.26](I miss you I miss you)
[01:08.25]
[01:12.86](I miss you I miss you)
[01:16.13]
[01:17.85]Where are you and I'm so sorry
[01:22.38]I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
[01:25.52]I need somebody and always
[01:28.73]This sick strange darkness
[01:30.95]Comes creeping on so haunting every time
[01:34.21]And as I stared I counted
[01:37.61]Webs from all the spiders
[01:39.85]Catching things and eating their insides
[01:42.90]Like indecision to call you
[01:46.09]and hear your voice of treason
[01:48.44]Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
[01:51.66]Stop this pain tonight
[01:52.96]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[01:57.14]The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
[02:01.58]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[02:05.63]The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
[02:12.21]
[02:31.99]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[02:36.00]The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
[02:40.78]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[02:44.68]The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
[02:49.46]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[02:53.35]The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
[02:57.96]Don't waste your time on me you're already
[03:02.05]The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
[03:07.65]
