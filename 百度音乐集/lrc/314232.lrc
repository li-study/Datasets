[00:00.00]HAPPY NEW YEAR
[00:04.00]歌手：范晓萱&蟑螂
[00:08.00]
[00:17.55]No more champagne
[00:19.60]And the fireworks
[00:21.58]Are through
[00:23.21]Here we are
[00:24.80]Me and you
[00:26.34]Felling lost
[00:28.02]And feeling blue
[00:30.16]It′s the end of the party
[00:33.80]And the morning
[00:35.08]Seems so grey
[00:36.86]So unlike
[00:38.49]Yesterday
[00:39.99]Now′s the time
[00:42.37]For us to say
[00:45.91]Happy new year
[00:47.37]Happy new year
[00:49.05]May we all
[00:50.11]Have a vision
[00:52.50]Now and then
[00:53.92]Of a world where
[00:55.96]Every neighbour is a friend
[01:00.87]Happy new year
[01:02.76]Happy new year
[01:04.53]May we all
[01:05.83]Have our hopes
[01:08.00]Our will to try
[01:09.62]If we don′t
[01:11.18]We might as well
[01:12.79]Lay down and die
[01:16.82]You and I
[01:22.09]Sometimes I see
[01:24.42]How the brave new
[01:25.98]World arrives
[01:27.70]And I see
[01:28.90]How it thrives
[01:31.13]In the ashes
[01:32.51]Of our lives
[01:34.68]Oh yes, man is a fool
[01:38.00]And he thinks
[01:39.60]He′ll be ok
[01:41.32]Dragging on
[01:42.99]Feet of clay
[01:44.84]Never knowing
[01:46.51]He′s astray
[01:48.46]Keeps on going
[01:51.63]Anyway
[01:54.88]Happy new year
[01:56.86]Happy new year
[01:58.68]May we all
[01:59.96]Have a vision
[02:02.21]Now and then
[02:03.60]Of a world where
[02:05.69]Every neighbour is a friend
[02:09.80]Happy new year
[02:12.67]Happy new year
[02:14.43]May we all
[02:15.87]Have our hopes
[02:17.92]Our will to try
[02:19.61]If we don′t
[02:21.59]We might as well
[02:22.73]Lay down and die
[02:26.86]You and I
[02:45.89]Seems to me now
[02:48.03]That the dreams
[02:49.70]We had before
[02:51.73]Are all dead
[02:53.26]Nothing more
[02:55.08]Than confetti
[02:56.92]On the floor
[02:58.71]It′s the end of the decade
[03:02.16]In another ten year′s time
[03:05.57]Who can say
[03:07.44]What we′ll find
[03:08.94]What lies waiting down the line
[03:12.75]In the end of
[03:15.76]Ninty-nine
[03:19.62]Happy new year
[03:21.09]Happy new year
[03:22.74]May we all
[03:24.06]Have a vision
[03:26.27]Now and then
[03:27.89]Of a world where
[03:30.04]Every neighbour is a friend
[03:35.02]Happy new year
[03:36.76]Happy new year
[03:38.50]May we all
[03:39.94]Have our hopes
[03:42.07]Our will to try
[03:43.77]If we don′t
[03:45.82]We might as well
[03:46.48]Lay down and die
[03:50.59]You and I
