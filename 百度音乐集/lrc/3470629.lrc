[00:09.86]Stacey Kent
[00:11.44]
[00:15.26]I took my love, I took it down
[00:22.04]I climbed a mountain and I turned around
[00:27.80]And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
[00:34.58]Till the landslide brought me down
[00:38.99]
[00:41.82]Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
[00:48.29]Can the child within my heart rise above?
[00:55.42]Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
[01:02.54]Can I handle the seasons of my life
[01:09.58]
[01:23.67]Well, I've been afraid of changing
[01:29.52]Cause I've built my life around you
[01:37.68]But time makes you bolder
[01:40.64]Even children get older and I'm getting older, too
[01:48.88]
[02:19.31]Well, I've been afraid of changing
[02:25.15]Cause I've built my life around you
[02:33.22]But time makes you bolder
[02:36.23]Even children get older and I'm getting older, too
[02:46.96]Yes, I'm getting older, too
[02:51.60]
[02:55.38]Oh, take my love, take it down
[03:02.01]Climb a mountain and turn around
[03:07.98]And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
[03:15.17]Well, the landslide will bring it down
[03:22.01]And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
[03:31.73]Well, the landslide will bring it down
[03:36.63]
