[00:07.46]
[00:16.87]Hello boy it's been a while
[00:22.64]Guess you'll be glad to know
[00:26.27]That I've learned how to laugh and smile
[00:31.04]Getting over was slow
[00:37.19]They say old lovers can be good friends
[00:43.64]But I never thought I'd really see you
[00:49.28]I'd really see you again
[00:52.17]
[00:52.56]I go crazy
[00:56.85]When I look in your eyes
[00:59.44]I still go crazy
[01:03.26]No my heart just can't hold that feeling inside
[01:09.21]Way deep down inside
[01:12.11]Oh baby you know when I look in your eyes
[01:18.91]I go crazy
[01:20.73]
[01:27.40]You say she satisfies your mind
[01:32.69]Tells you all of her dreams
[01:36.11]I know how much that means to you
[01:40.66]I realize that I was blind
[01:46.93]Just when I thought I was over you
[01:53.66]I see your face and it just ain't true
[01:59.10]No it just ain't true
[02:02.03]
[02:02.37]I go crazy
[02:06.62]When I look in your eyes
[02:09.13]I still go crazy
[02:13.01]That old flame comes alive
[02:16.32]It's starts burning inside
[02:19.67]Way deep down inside
[02:22.65]Oh baby
[02:26.63]You know when I look in your eyes
[02:29.90]I go crazy
[02:33.02]
[03:00.09]I go crazy
[03:03.72]You know when I look in your eyes
[03:06.79]I go crazy
[03:10.65]No my heart just can't hide
[03:14.01]That old feeling inside
[03:17.35]Way deep down inside
[03:20.33]I go crazy
[03:23.78]You know when I look in your eyes
[03:26.93]I go crazy
[03:29.44]
[03:35.24]Crazy
