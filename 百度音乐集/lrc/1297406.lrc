[00:08]Girls - all I really want is girls
[00:14]And in the morning it's girls
[00:17]Cause in the evening it's girls
[00:20]I like the way that they walk
[00:24]And it's chill to hear them talk
[00:27]And I can always make them smile
[00:31]From White Castle to the Nile
[00:33]
[00:34]Back in the day
[00:37]There was this girl around the way
[00:41]She liked by home-piece M.C.A.
[00:44]He said he would not give her play
[00:48]I asked him, "Please?" - he said, "You may."
[00:51]Her pants were tight and that's ok
[00:55]If she would dance - I would D.J.
[00:58]We took a walk down to the bay
[01:02]I hope she'll say, "Hey me and you should hit the hay!"
[01:07]I asked her out - she said, "No way!"
[01:16]So I broke North with no delay
[01:19]I heard she moved real far away
[01:23]That was two years ago this May
[01:26]I seen her just the other day
[01:29]Jockin' Mike D. to my dismay
[01:37]
[01:40]Girls - to do the dishes
[01:42]Girls - to clean up my room
[01:44]Girls - to do the laundry
[01:45]Girls - and in the bathroom
[01:47]Girls - that's all I really want is girls
[01:53]Two at a time - I want girls
[01:56]With new wave hairdos - I want girls
[01:59]I ought to whip out my - girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!
