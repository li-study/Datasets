[00:00.69]Amy MacDonald - Love Love
[00:01.56]
[00:30.19]Oh, love, love, you tear my world apart
[00:35.34]Oh, love, love, you always break my heart
[00:41.75]It's been too long since you left me
[00:44.42]It's been too long since the start
[00:47.35]Oh, love, love, please don't break my heart
[00:51.44]
[00:53.27]Oh, love, love, you always bring me down
[00:59.64]Oh, love, love, you turn my life around
[01:05.71]Oh I don't know how to tell you
[01:08.44]Oh I don't know what to say
[01:11.59]But my heart is yours, love, in every single way
[01:15.96]
[01:18.02]And at night I sit and cry, it seems
[01:21.28]Wondering why love is not like my dreams
[01:24.25]Wondering why I am still here all alone
[01:29.67]And at night I wish that you were there
[01:33.07]Touching my face and stroking my hair
[01:36.16]Telling me things, telling me stories
[01:39.32]Telling me you love me and all my glory
[01:42.36]
[01:42.81]Love, love, you're always in my heart
[01:47.68]Oh, love, love, I've known it from the start
[01:53.79]Oh I wish that I could tell you
[01:56.03]Oh I wish that I could say
[01:59.46]That my heart is yours, love, in every single way
[02:03.76]
[02:05.37]And at night I sit and cry, it seems
[02:08.61]Wondering why love is not like my dreams
[02:11.77]Wondering why I am still here all alone
[02:17.29]And at night I wish that you were there
[02:20.73]Touching my face and stroking my hair
[02:23.83]Telling me things, telling me stories
[02:26.81]Telling me you love me and all my glory
[02:29.49]
[02:29.90]Love, love, I wish that I could see
[02:35.24]What in the world you mean to me
[02:41.44]Oh, love, love, you always bring me down, down, down
[02:47.39]Oh, love, love, I wish you'd stick around
[02:56.55]
