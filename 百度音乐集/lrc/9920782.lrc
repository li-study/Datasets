[00:06.73]You think I'm an ignorant savage
[00:10.07]And you've been so many places
[00:12.26]I guess it must be so
[00:14.37]But still I cannot see
[00:17.02]If the savage one is me
[00:20.57]How can there be so much that you don't know
[00:27.21]You don't know..
[00:39.85]You think you own whatever land you land on
[00:44.72]Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
[00:49.29]But I know every rock and tree and creature
[00:53.66]Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
[00:57.49]
[00:58.37]You think the only people who are people
[01:02.88]Are the people who look and think like you
[01:07.62]But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
[01:11.72]You learn things you never knew you never knew
[01:16.23]
[01:16.76]Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
[01:21.13]or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned
[01:25.47]Can you sing with all the voices
[01:28.01]of the mountains?
[01:30.37]Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
[01:35.17]Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
[01:41.39]
[01:49.28]Come run the hidden pinet rails of the forest
[01:53.45]Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
[01:57.48]Come roll in all the riches all around you
[02:01.56]And for once never wonder what they're worth
[02:05.31]
[02:05.84]The rainstorm and the rivers are my brothers
[02:10.29]And the heron and the other are my friends
[02:14.92]And we are all connected to each other
[02:19.05]In a circle in a hoop that never ends
[02:22.68]
[02:24.00]How high does the sycamore grow
[02:28.29]If you cut it down, then you'll never know
[02:33.23]
[02:34.43]And you'll never hear the wolf cry
[02:37.92]To the blue corn moon
[02:40.06]Or whether we are white or copper-skinned
[02:44.75]We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
[02:49.49]Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
[02:54.23]You can own the Earth and still all you'll own is earth
[03:00.02]Until you can paint with all the colors of the wind
[03:15.85]
