[00:00.00]SMASHING PUMPKINS LYRICS - Cupid De Locke
[00:32.39]Cupid hath pulled back his sweetheart's情人 bow
[00:36.90]To cast divine非凡的 可爱的 arrows into her soul
[00:42.10]To grab攫取 her attention swift快速的 and quick
[00:47.06]Or morrow次日 the marrow骨髓 of her bones be thick浓厚的 粗的
[00:56.63]With turpentine松节油 kisses and mistaken blows
[01:15.57]See the devil魔鬼 may do as the devil may care
[01:22.01]He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
[01:26.54]Her mouth the mischief淘气的人 he doth seek寻找
[01:31.77]Her heart the captive俘虏 of which he speaks
[01:40.75]So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
[01:49.98]Your world be shattered打碎 with nary连...也没有的 a note
[01:55.28]Of one Cupids arrow under your coat
[02:15.51]And in the land of star crossed lovers
[02:18.59]And barren单调的 hearted wanderers流浪者
[02:22.00]Forever lost in forsaken孤独的 missives信件 and satan's pull
[02:25.64]We seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable
[02:34.28]Our hopes dead gathering dust灰尘 to dust
[02:37.69]In faith忠实, in compassion怜悯, and in love
