[00:00.00]Avril Lavigne - I'm With You
[00:09.00]
[00:19.47]I'm standing on a bridge
[00:21.59]I'm waiting in the dark
[00:24.03]I thought that you'd be here by now
[00:28.55]There's nothing but the rain
[00:30.93]No footsteps on the ground
[00:33.21]I'm listening but there's no sound
[01:35.16][00:38.60]Isn't anyone trying to find me?
[01:39.73][00:43.05]Won't somebody come take me home
[02:30.97][01:43.33][00:46.87]It's a damn cold night
[02:35.29][01:48.07][00:51.54]Trying to figure out this life
[02:39.93][01:52.67][00:56.28]Won't you take me by the hand
[02:42.66][01:55.16][00:58.69]Take me somewhere new
[02:44.95][01:57.84][01:01.21]I dont know who you are
[02:47.51][02:00.38][01:03.99]But I... I'm with you
[02:54.18][02:06.99][01:09.58]I'm with you
[01:15.83]I'm looking for a place
[01:18.16]Searching for a face
[01:20.44]Is anybody here I know
[01:25.08]Cause nothing's going right
[01:27.52]And everything's a mess
[01:30.01]And no one likes to be alone
[02:11.85]Oh why is everything so confusing
[02:17.33]Maybe I'm just out of my mind
[02:21.42]Yea yea yea ...
[03:18.84][03:00.01]Take me by the hand
[03:20.27][03:01.28]Take me somewhere new
[03:22.84][03:03.75]I don't know who you are
[03:25.29][03:06.38]But I... I'm with you
[03:36.51][03:12.88]I'm with you
[03:30.94]Oh,I'm with you
