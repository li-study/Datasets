[00:00.67]Lady Antebellum - Perfect Day
[00:01.38]
[00:19.51]Went walkin' through town just the other day with nothin' much to do
[00:24.36]As the sun came breakin' down through the clouds I never seen the sky so blue
[00:28.88]I saw a Cajun man with a red guitar singin' on the side of the street
[00:33.47]I threw a handful of change in his beat up case and said play me a country beat
[00:37.64]And it sounded like
[00:38.64]
[00:46.79]Met up with some friends outside of town we were headed towards the lake
[00:51.82]I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep, felt the wind upon my face
[00:56.37]We got to the spot and the sun was hot everybody was feelin' fine
[01:01.04]So we jumped on in for a midday swim then we lost all track of time
[01:04.96]
[01:05.57]It was a perfect day
[01:08.10]What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
[01:13.27]Lost in this moment, now
[01:17.07]Ain't worried 'bout tomorrow when your busy livin' in a perfect day
[01:27.09]
[01:33.36]As the moon came out and the fire burned, everybody was singin' along
[01:38.03]To some ramblin' a little Curtis Lowe and all those feel good songs
[01:42.63]We danced all night without a care, no place we'd rather be
[01:47.23]Cuz these are the days we'll talked about
[01:49.73]When we lived so wild and free
[01:51.30]
[01:51.75]It was a perfect day
[01:54.43]What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
[01:59.00]Lost in this moment, now
[02:03.20]Ain't worried 'bout tomorrow when your busy livin' in a perfect day
[02:13.27]
[02:19.25]We were sittin' in the sand as he grabbed my hand and he leaned in for a kiss
[02:24.39]I couldn't help but think with the stars above, it doesn't get much better than this
[02:28.40]
[02:28.85]It was a perfect day
[02:31.16]What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
[02:35.83]Lost in this moment, now
[02:40.47]Ain't worried 'bout tomorrow when your busy livin', feels like dreamin',
[02:47.60]Slowly driftin' through this perfect day
[02:55.70]
[03:01.71]Na na na na na...
