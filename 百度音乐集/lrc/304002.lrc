[00:44.28]到底该不该  管它该不该
[00:49.66]就是奋不顾身的喜欢
[00:55.18]开心的你　说谎的失约的你
[01:00.47]忐忑不安
[01:06.35]朝着你盛开 绕着你而转
[01:11.87]模仿你的样子和色彩
[01:17.47]身为只能　被你唤醒的花朵
[01:22.66]奢求答案
[02:54.96][01:34.60]阳光不肯回答
[03:27.81][02:59.98][01:39.33]向日葵只能远远梦想
[03:33.84][03:06.25][01:45.58]寂寞的重量压得我把头低下
[03:39.43][03:11.67][01:50.99]花季里微笑着勉强
[04:46.85][04:28.46][04:10.45][03:17.50][02:02.26][01:56.76]只是紮了根的心走不远哪
[02:09.34]it's not that don't wanna have you in sight

[02:15.35]If you lie you deny and if you say goodbye
[02:17.97]Will I ever be able to stop the cry
[02:21.15]So just give me some time a little bit more time
[02:23.65]Let me slowly forget how we met
[02:25.53]No upsets no regrets But not yet
[02:28.48]I'll stay a while
[02:30.05]Cuz I love to see you smile
[02:40.45]I\\"ll stay a while just to see you smile
[02:43.95]朝着你盛开 绕着你而转
[02:49.31]每天都有最新的悲哀
[03:22.88]阳光它总是不肯回答
