[00:02.25]Sunday Morning - maroon five
[00:07.20]
[00:17.44]Sunday morning rain is falling
[00:23.00]Steal some covers share some skin
[00:28.53]Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
[00:33.16]You twist to fit the mold that I am in
[00:36.60]
[00:38.58]But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
[00:43.03]And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
[00:49.01]That someday it would lead me back to you
[00:54.37]That someday it would lead me back to you
[00:57.44](Someday)
[00:58.92]That may be all I need
[01:03.60]In darkness she is all I see
[01:09.57]Come and rest your bones with me
[01:14.41]Driving slow on Sunday morning
[01:17.34]And I never want to leave
[01:19.92]
[01:21.98]Fingers trace your every outline
[01:27.32]Paint a picture with my hands
[01:32.74]Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
[01:37.83]Change the weather still together when it ends
[01:40.69]
[01:42.10]That may be all I need
[01:46.81]In darkness she is all I see
[01:52.08]Come and rest your bones with me
[01:57.53]Driving slow on Sunday morning
[02:00.55]And I never want to leave
[02:04.45].........
[02:18.99]Oh..yeah..but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
[02:26.20](life gets hard to do)
[02:26.67]Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
[02:32.08]Singing someday it'll bring me back to you..yeah..
[02:37.71]Find a way to bring myself back home to you
[02:41.45]May not know that may be all I need
[02:46.93]
[02:47.28]In darkness she is all I see
[02:53.05]Come and rest your bones with me
[02:57.40]Driving slow on Sunday morning
[03:01.34]Driving slow......
[03:03.37]..............................
[03:10.13]Cross a flower in your hair
[03:13.19]Cross a flower in your hair
[03:15.30]...........................
[03:37.71]In darkness..in darkness..in darkness..
