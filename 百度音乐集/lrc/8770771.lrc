[00:00] Suede : Trash
[00:16]Maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear,
[00:21]The tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair,
[00:26]Maybe it's our kookiness,
[00:32]Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns,
[00:36]Our nothing places and our cellophane sounds,
[00:42]Maybe it's our looseness,
[00:47]But we're trash, you and me,
[00:52]We're the litter on the breeze,
[00:56]We're the lovers on the streets,
[01:02]Just trash, me and you,
[01:07]It's in everything we do,
[01:11]It's in everything we do...
[01:19]Or Maybe, maybe it's the things we say,
[01:23]The words we've heard and the music we play,
[01:28]Maybe it's our cheapness,
[01:33]Or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had,
[01:38]The lazy days and the crazes and the fads,
[01:43]Maybe it's our sweetness,
[01:48]But we're trash, you and me,
[01:54]We're the litter on the breeze,
[01:58]We're the lovers on the streets,
[02:02]Just trash, me and you,
[02:09]It's in everything we do,
[02:13]It's in everything we do...
[02:22]
[03:21][02:49]We're trash, you and me,
[03:26][02:55]We're the lovers on the streets,
[03:30][02:59]We're the litter on the breeze,
[03:36][03:05]Just trash, me and you,
[03:42][03:10]It's in everything we do,
[03:46][03:14]It's in everything we do...
