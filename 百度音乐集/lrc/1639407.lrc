[00:00.06]Arcade Fire - Ocean Of Noise
[00:01.93]
[00:35.69]Ocean of noise
[00:40.06]I first heard your voice
[00:44.78]Ring like a bell
[00:49.13]As if I had a choice, oh well
[00:53.07]
[01:03.36]Left in the morning
[01:07.70]While you were fast asleep
[01:12.24]To an ocean of violence
[01:16.68]A world of empty streets
[01:19.49]
[01:21.48]You've got your reasons
[01:25.85]And me, I've got mine
[01:29.74]But all the reasons I gave
[01:35.69]Were just lies
[01:37.90]To buy yourself some time
[01:44.30]
[01:53.22]An ocean of noise
[01:57.74]I first heard your voice
[02:02.25]Now who here among us
[02:06.83]Still believes in choice?
[02:09.70]Not I
[02:10.99]
[02:20.64]No way of knowing
[02:25.18]What any men will do
[02:29.61]An ocean of violence
[02:34.20]Between me and you
[02:36.16]
[02:38.86]You've got your reasons
[02:43.29]And me, I've got mine
[02:47.07]But all the reasons I gave
[02:53.24]Were just lies
[02:55.36]To buy myself some time
[03:01.93]
[03:08.33]And can we work it out?
[03:17.28]It's time to work it out
[03:25.47]Going to work it out
[03:35.39]It's time to work it out for you
[03:40.26]We're going to work it all out
[03:47.84]It's time to work it out
[03:52.61]We're going to work it out
[04:02.45]It's time to work it out
[04:07.30]Time to work it all out
[04:12.34]
