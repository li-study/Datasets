
[00:02.30]Run
[00:03.21]Leona Lewis
[00:04.60]
[00:06.96]I'll sing it one last time for you
[00:13.68]Then we really have to go
[00:19.80]You've been the only thing that's right
[00:26.18]In all I've done
[00:29.59]
[00:33.52]And I can barely look at you
[00:39.65]But every single time I do
[00:46.37]I know we'll make it anywhere
[00:52.79]Away from here
[00:56.37]
[01:01.30]Light up, light up
[01:05.06]As if you have a choice
[01:10.18]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[01:16.77]I'll be right beside you dear
[01:22.11]
[01:25.64]To think I might not see those eyes
[01:32.79]Makes it so hard not to cry
[01:38.56]And as we say our long goodbye
[01:45.21]I nearly do
[01:48.90]
[01:53.94]Light up, light up
[01:57.88]As if you have a choice
[02:03.33]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[02:10.06]I'll be right beside you dear
[02:15.51]
[02:20.83]Louder louder
[02:24.67]And we'll run for our lives
[02:30.16]I can hardly speak I understand
[02:36.74]Why you can't raise your voice to say
[02:45.88]
[03:14.96]Light up, light up
[03:18.52]As if you have a choice
[03:24.33]Even if you cannot hear my voice
[03:31.16]I'll be right beside you dear
[03:40.22]
[03:42.08]Louder louder
[03:46.20]And we'll run for our lives
[03:51.34]I can hardly speak I understand
[03:57.91]Why you can't raise your voice to say
[04:08.03]
