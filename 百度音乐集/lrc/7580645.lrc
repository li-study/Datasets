[00:15.28]Don't lose your way
[00:18.19]When each passing day
[00:22.43]You've come so far, don't throw it away
[00:29.41]Live believing, dreams are for weaving
[00:36.41]Wonders are waiting to start
[00:43.76]Live your story
[00:47.34]Faith, hope, and glory
[00:50.47]Hold to the truth in your heart
[00:57.96]If we hold on together
[01:04.98]I know our dreams will never die
[01:11.60]Dreams see us through to forever
[01:18.30]Where clouds roll by for you and I
[01:31.92]Souls and the wind must learn how to bend
[01:38.78]Seek out a star, hold on to the end
[01:45.58]Valley, mountain, there is a fountain
[01:52.46]Washes our tears all away
[01:59.52]Words are swaying, someone is praying
[02:06.18]Please let us come home to stay
[02:13.30]If we hold on together
[02:20.30]I know our dreams will never die
[02:26.65]Dreams see us through to forever
[02:32.93]Where clouds roll by for you and I
[02:46.35]When we are out there in the dark
[02:53.68]We'll dream about the sun
[03:00.14]In the dark we'll feel the light
[03:07.31]Warm our hearts, everyone
[03:15.86]If we hold on together
[03:22.56]I know our dreams will never die
[03:29.39]Dreams see us through to forever
[03:35.59]As high as souls can fly
[03:41.56]The clouds roll by for you and I
[04:00.62]
