[00:20.18]I need a gun to keep myself from harm
[00:24.93]The poor people are burning in the sun
[00:29.73]But they ain′t got a chance
[00:32.25]They ain′t got a chance
[00:34.89]I need a gun
[00:39.90][00:37.16]Cos all I do is dance
[00:49.88]
[01:05.02]I need a gun to keep myself from harm
[01:09.82]The poor people are burning in the sun
[01:14.80]No, they ain′t got a chance
[01:17.30]They ain′t got a chance
[01:19.86]I need a gun
[01:22.14]Cos all I do is dance
[01:24.78]Cos all I do is dance
[01:29.68]
[02:10.28]In my backpack
[02:10.87]I got my act right
[02:12.19]In case you act quite difficult
[02:13.63]And yo is so weakin′
[02:16.19]With anger and discontent
[02:17.72]Some are seeking and searching like me, moi
[02:20.53]I′m a peace-loving decoy
[02:21.48]Ready for retaliation
[02:23.64]I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
[02:26.42]Impulsive don′t ask wild wonder
[02:28.50]Orders given to me is:
[02:30.05]strike and I′m thunder
[02:31.29]with lightning fast reflexes on constant alert
[02:33.47]from the constant hurt that seems
[02:35.69]limitless with no dropping pressure
[02:37.39]Seems like everybody′s out to test ya
[02:39.81]til they see your brake
[02:40.99]They can′t conceal the hate
[02:42.73]That consumes you
[02:43.56]I′m the reason why you flipped your soosa
[02:45.76]
[02:46.14]Chill with your old lady at the tilt
[02:48.29]I got a 90 days digit
[02:49.84]And I′m filled with guilt
[02:51.07]From things that I′ve seen
[02:52.41]Your water′s from a bottle
[02:53.65]mine′s from a canteen
[02:54.68]At night I hear the shots
[02:55.86]Ring so I′m a light sleeper
[02:57.95]The cost of life
[02:58.98]it seems to get cheaper
[02:59.72]out in the desert with my street sweeper
[03:02.34]The war is over
[03:03.05]So said the speaker with the flight suit on
[03:06.58]Maybe to him I′m just a pawn
[03:07.44]So he can advance
[03:11.02]Remember when I used to dance
[03:13.03]Man, all I want to do is dance
[03:29.63]I need a gun to keep myself from harm
