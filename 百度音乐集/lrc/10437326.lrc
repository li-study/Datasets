[00:30.42]I've been waiting so long,
[00:34.17]To see the moon rising by your side,
[00:39.73]How many days, since you're gone
[00:49.33]I've cried so many times,
[00:53.77]But I've spent so many hours to hide,
[00:58.83]The tears I had in my mind
[01:08.58][02:25.23]When will I see you again,
[01:13.27][02:29.93]Give me a last chance to make
[01:16.67][02:33.62]Love, with you forever and ever again,
[01:23.67]I miss you,
[01:27.28][02:44.18]I can't feel pain anymore,
[01:31.78][02:48.56]I'm just lost in a world of sorrow,
[01:39.81][02:57.25]But I will wait the hour
[01:43.58][03:00.19]To set your heart on fire
[01:56.89]Mountains of ice i will cross
[02:01.20]Fountains of gold I will find,
[02:06.27]To give you some presents,
[02:08.72]As precious as you
[02:15.66]In endlessly I will shout,
[02:20.16]Your name in the silence of night,
[02:40.88]I love you,
