[00:00.00]I think about how it might have been
[00:12.67]We'd spend out days travelin'
[00:30.48]It's not that I don't understand you
[00:36.16]It's not that I don't want to be with you
[00:40.00]But you only wanted me
[00:43.07]The way you wanted me
[00:47.03]So, I will head out along and hope for the best
[00:54.87]And we can hang out heads down
[00:58.16]As we skip the goodbyes
[01:01.23]And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
[01:07.15]I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
[01:11.21]So, I'm up for the little white lies
[01:16.03]But you and I know the reason why
[01:26.51]I'm gone, and you're still there
[01:30.24]I'm gone, and you're still there
[01:34.37]I'm gone, and you're still there
[01:41.58]I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
[01:49.43]From coast to coast, or whatever I find my place
[01:55.41]I'll track you on the radios, and
[02:00.90]I'll sign your list in a different name
[02:04.52]But as close as I come to you
[02:07.90]It's not the same
[02:12.02]So, I will head out along and hope for the best
[02:20.06]We can pat ourselves on the back
[02:23.25]As say that we tried
[02:27.59]And if one of us makes it big
[02:31.97]We can spill our regrets
[02:38.02]And talk about how the love never dies
[02:45.39]But you and I know the reason why
[02:55.12]I'm gone, and you're still there
[02:59.19]I'm gone, and you're still there
[03:03.35]I'm gone, and you're still there
[03:11.05]So, steal the show, and do your best
[03:15.16]To cover the tracks that I have left
[03:18.83]I wish you well and hope you find
[03:23.63]Whatever you're looking for
[03:26.85]The way I might've changed my mind,
[03:31.66]But you only showed my the door
[03:36.34]So, I will head out along and hope for the best
[03:49.51]We can pat ourselves on the back
[03:52.90]And say that we tried
[03:57.55]And if one of us makes it big
[04:01.65]We can spill our regrets
[04:06.79]And talk about how the love never dies
[04:21.89]But you and I, you and I know the reason why
