[00:00.00]Folsom Prison
[00:02.00](johnny cash)
[00:03.00]
[00:08.14]I hear the train a coming
[00:10.84]it's rolling round the bend
[00:13.12]And I ain't seen the sunshine
[00:15.86]since I don't know when
[00:17.96]I'm stuck at Folsom Prison
[00:20.59]and time keeps draggin' on
[00:23.61]
[00:26.41]But that train keeps rolling
[00:29.83]on down to San Antone
[00:33.97]When I was just a baby
[00:36.71]my mama told me, "Son
[00:39.18]Always be a good boy
[00:41.46]don't ever play with guns."
[00:43.53]But I shot a man in Reno
[00:46.39]just to watch him die
[00:48.65]
[00:51.42]When I hear that whistle blowing
[00:53.99]I hang my head and cry
[00:57.90]
[01:23.04]I bet there's rich folk eating
[01:26.16]in a fancy dining car
[01:28.51]They're prob'ly drinking coffee
[01:30.85]and smokin' big cigars
[01:33.10]But I know I had it coming
[01:35.77]I know I can't be free
[01:40.17]But those people keep a moving
[01:44.86]and that's what tortures me
[01:47.90]
[02:11.94]Well, if they freed me from this prison
[02:14.98]if that railroad train was mine,
[02:17.21]I bet I'd move on over
[02:19.64]a little farther down the line
[02:22.46]Far from Folsom Prison
[02:24.77]that's where I want to stay
[02:28.95]
[02:31.50]And I'd let that lonesome whistle
[02:34.02]blow my blues away.
