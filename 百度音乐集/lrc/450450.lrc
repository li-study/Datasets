
[00:10.00]Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
[00:18.00]I hear you call my name
[00:23.00]And it feels like home
[00:30.00]
[00:38.00]When you call my name it's like a little prayer
[00:42.00]I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
[00:46.00]In the midnight hour I can feel your power
[00:50.00]Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
[00:55.00]I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
[01:04.00]I have no choice, I hear your voice
[01:09.00]Feels like flying
[01:12.00]I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
[01:20.00]Out of the sky, I close my eyes
[01:26.00]Heaven help me
[01:29.00]When you call my name it's like a little prayer
[01:33.00]I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
[01:37.00]In the midnight hour I can feel your power
[01:42.00]Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
[01:47.00]Like a child you whisper softly to me
[01:55.00]You're in control just like a child
[02:00.00]Now I'm dancing
[02:03.00]It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
[02:12.00]You're here with me, it's like a dream
[02:18.00]Let the choir sing
[02:37.00][02:20.00]When you call my name it's like a little prayer
[02:42.00][02:25.00]I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
[02:46.00][02:29.00]In the midnight hour I can feel your power
[02:50.00][02:33.00]Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
[02:56.00]
[03:03.00]Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
[03:12.00]I hear you call my name
[03:16.00]And it feels like home
[03:20.00]Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
[03:24.00]Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
[03:29.00]Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
[03:34.00]Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
[04:03.00][03:54.00][03:46.00][03:38.00]Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
[04:07.00][03:59.00][03:50.00][03:42.00]It's like a dream to me
[04:29.00][04:11.00]Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
[04:33.00][04:16.00]Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
[04:37.00][04:21.00]Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
[04:42.00][04:25.00]Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
[04:57.00]
