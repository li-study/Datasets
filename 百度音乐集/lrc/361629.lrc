[00:57.67]I fell apart
[01:01.72]I fell apart over you
[01:07.69]
[01:10.26]When I see you
[01:12.15]I just see the pain
[01:16.23]When I feel you
[01:18.46]Nothing feels the same
[01:21.08]

[01:34.68]Wasted love
[01:36.06]Wasted love
[01:41.80]Now it’s over
[01:44.41]
[01:53.95]Worry won’t make things work our way
[01:57.60]Worry makes us both too afraid
[02:03.47]I fall apart
[02:06.59]I fall apart over you
[02:12.61]
[02:15.95]Worry that there’s nothing to say
[02:21.61]Worry that there’s too much to say
[02:27.41]I fall apart
[02:30.18]I fall apart over you
[02:37.72]
[02:40.63]When I see you
[02:42.20]I just see the pain
[02:46.27]When I feel you
[02:48.45]Nothing feels the same
[02:50.62]
[02:51.02]I faded love
[02:52.56]Faded love
[02:54.13]Faded love
[02:59.68]Ran for cover
[03:02.00]
[03:03.01]I wasted love
[03:04.54]Wasted love
[03:06.12]Wasted love
[03:11.78]Now it’s over
[03:14.68]
[03:15.13]When we took our places
[03:17.85]With a story untold
[03:21.83]I had so much to give
[03:26.47]
[03:27.29]Then you had to ask for something
[03:29.70]That I never could give
[03:32.70]So I gave you nothing
[03:35.98]Gave you nothing at all
[04:13.14]
