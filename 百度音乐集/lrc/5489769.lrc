[00:13.85]Astair your glare is killing me
[00:19.06]Astair in skies of blue
[00:23.01]The signs you wear are making me
[00:28.88]So confused
[00:32.34]
[00:32.70]But the mountains and the trees
[00:34.21]Are they just what you need
[00:36.63]Or are they less than what
[00:39.30]You'd expect to see
[00:42.04]
[00:42.32]And if you're leaving well come
[00:44.30]Give me reason why I let you down
[00:48.38]Before you turn around now now
[00:55.34]Before you turn around
[00:59.04]
[01:07.00]Astair you're there and I'm still here
[01:12.17]I swear I'm so confused
[01:16.17]The signs you wear are making me
[01:21.57]Feel like I'm the one to lose
[01:24.96]
[01:25.46]But the canyons and the seas
[01:27.19]Are they just what you need
[01:29.69]Or are they less than what
[01:32.83]You'd expect to see
[01:35.18]
[01:35.65]And if you're leaving well come
[01:37.44]Give me reason why I let you down
[01:41.54]Before you turn around now, now
[01:48.13]
[01:48.46]Before you turn around
[01:59.79]
[02:18.39]But the mountains and the trees
[02:21.08]Are they what you perceive
[02:23.07]Or are they less than what
[02:25.72]You'd expect to see
[02:28.16]
[02:28.41]And if you're leaving well come
[02:30.59]Give me reason why I let you down
[02:34.70]Before you turn around now, now
[02:41.53]Before you turn around
[02:51.50]Before you turn around
