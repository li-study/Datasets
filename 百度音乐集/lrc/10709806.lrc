[00:09.69]Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation.
[00:18.64]Darkness wakes and stirs imagination.
[00:26.42]Silently the senses abandon their defences,
[00:35.94]Helpless to resist the notes I write
[00:42.37]For I compose the music of the night.
[00:51.23]Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
[00:59.35]Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
[01:07.07]Hearing is believing, music is deceiving,
[01:15.78]Hard as lighting, soft as candle light.
[01:21.85]Dare you trust the music of the night?
[01:28.68]Close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
[01:36.17]And the truth isn't what you want to see,
[01:43.03]In the darkness it's easy to pretend
[01:53.55]That the truth is what is ought to be.
[02:03.77]Softly, deftly, music shall caress you.
[02:12.63]Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you.
[02:21.31]Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
[02:29.69]In this darkness which you know you cannot fight,
[02:37.19]The darhness of the music of the night.
[02:44.08]Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange, new world,
[02:50.91]Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before.
[02:57.99]Close your eyes and let music set you free.
[03:08.39]Only then can you belong to me.
[03:20.37]Floating,falling,sweet intoxication.
[03:31.31]Touch me, trust me savour each sensation.
[03:43.19]Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
[03:51.89]To the power of the music that I write,
[04:00.07]The power of the music of the night.
[04:32.00]You alone can make my song take flight
[04:41.14]Help me make the music of the night
