[00:05.16]
[00:13.85]Once there were stars out in the night
[00:19.38]They never seemed to shine
[00:22.28]And love was there for every heart
[00:27.72]Seemed every heart but mine
[00:30.93]That's how it seemed to be
[00:35.02]Then darlin' you changed everything
[00:39.31]Just when I thought I'd given up
[00:42.42]Out walked loneliness
[00:44.93]
[00:45.30]In walked love
[00:47.41]In walked you
[00:49.58]In walked all my dreams comin' true
[00:53.92](In walked love)
[00:57.03]Right through my door
[01:01.65]I saw your face and I knew
[01:06.19]All I'd looked for I had found in you
[01:10.99]I found the one that I'd been dreamin' of
[01:18.62]In walked love
[01:22.29]
[01:29.04]I threw my heart into the wind
[01:34.04]I'd thrown all hope away
[01:37.26]That love would never let me in
[01:42.71]And then you came my way
[01:45.83]Just like a ray of light
[01:50.11]That breaks through the long cold night
[01:54.15]You brought in a brand new morning sun
[01:57.63]Out walked loneliness
[02:00.09]
[02:00.35]In walked love
[02:02.56]In walked you
[02:04.57]In walked all my dreams comin' true
[02:08.71](In walked love)
[02:12.11]Right through my door
[02:16.55]I saw your face and I knew
[02:21.10]all I'd looked for I had found in you
[02:25.96]I found the one that I'd been dreamin' of
[02:33.72]In walked love
[02:36.35]
[03:44.53]In walked love
[03:46.51]In walked you
[03:48.68]In walked all my dreams comin' true
[03:53.21](In walked love)
[03:56.15]Right through my door
[04:00.86]I saw your face and I knew
[04:05.32]All I'd looked for I had found in you
[04:10.17]I found the one that I'd been dreamin' of
[04:17.84]In walked love
