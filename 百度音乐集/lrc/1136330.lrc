[00:30.65]Title: I Write The Songs
[00:38.48]I've been alive forever,
[00:46.30]and I wrote the very first song.
[00:54.13]I put the words and the melodies together,
[01:01.96]I am music,
[01:09.79]and I write the songs.
[01:17.61]I write the songs that make the whole world sing.
[01:25.44]I write the songs of love and special thing s.
[01:33.27]I write the songs that make the young girls cry.
[01:41.10]I write the songs, I write the songs.
[01:48.92]My home lies deep within you,
[01:56.75]and I've got my own place in your sole.
[02:04.58]Now, when I look out through your eyes,
[02:12.41]I'm you'g again, even though I'm very old.
[02:20.23]Chorus
[02:28.06]Oh my music makes you dance
[02:35.89]and gives your spirit to take a chance,
[02:43.72]and I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move.
[02:51.54]Music fills your heart,
[02:59.37]well, that's a real fine place to start.
[03:07.20]It's from me it's for you,
[03:15.02]it's from you, it's from me,
[03:22.85]it's a world wide symphony.
[03:30.68]Chorus
[03:38.51]I am music, and I write the songs.
[03:46.33]
