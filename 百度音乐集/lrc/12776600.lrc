[00:03.65]
[00:07.03]I'm a big big girl
[00:09.61]In a big big world
[00:12.22]It's not a big big thing if you leave me
[00:17.76]But I do do feel 
[00:20.50]that I do do will miss you much
[00:26.92]Miss you much.
[00:28.65]
[00:32.83]I can see the first leaf falling
[00:38.24]It's all yellow and nice
[00:43.53]It's so very cold outside
[00:48.97]Like the way I'm feeling inside
[00:53.25]I'm a big big girl
[00:55.98]In a big big world

[01:06.82]that I do do will miss you much
[01:13.34]Miss you much.
[01:14.97]
[01:21.85]Outside it's now raining
[01:27.35]And tears are falling from my eyes
[01:32.62]Why did it have to happen
[01:38.09]Why did it all have to end
[01:42.31]I'm a big big girl
[01:45.11]In a big big world
[01:47.64]It's not a big big thing if you leave me
[01:53.09]But I do do feel 
[01:56.00]that I do do will miss you much
[02:02.41]Miss you much.
[02:04.31]
[02:05.53]I have your arms around me ooooh like fire
[02:15.39]But when I open my eyes
[02:20.39]You're gone.
[02:25.10]
[02:26.08]I'm a big big girl
[02:28.69]In a big big world
[02:31.21]It's not a big big thing if you leave me
[02:36.72]But I do do feel  
[02:39.61]that I do do will miss you much
[02:46.11]Miss you much.
[02:47.69]I'm a big big girl
[02:50.41]In a big big world
[02:53.04]It's not a big big thing if you leave me
[02:58.59]But I do feel I will miss you much
