[00:46.54]Even on a day like this when you're crawling on the floor
[00:57.68]Reaching for the phone to ring anyone who knows you anymore
[01:07.84]It's all right to make mistakes
[01:11.58]you're only human
[01:13.21]Inside everybody's hiding something
[01:19.12]Staring at the same four walls, have you tried to help yourself
[01:29.35]The rings around your eyes they don't hide, that you need to get some rest
[01:38.50]It's all right to make mistakes you're only human
[01:45.11]Inside everybody's hiding something
[01:49.93]Take time to catch your breathe and choose your moment
[01:55.36]Don't slide
[02:21.68]Even at a time like this when the morning seems so far
[02:31.59]Think that pain belongs to you but it's happened to us all
[02:42.77]It's all right to make mistakes you're only human
[02:48.05]Inside everybody's hiding something
[02:53.57]Take time to catch your breathe and choose your moment
[02:58.78]Don't slide
[03:23.29]You brought this on yourself
[03:26.43]and it's high time you left it there
[03:33.28]Lie here and rest your head
[03:37.50]and dream of something else instead
[03:42.95]Don't slide
