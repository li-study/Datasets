[00:06.00]豆豆，我们相爱一年了，OH YEAH
[00:09.06]Well you gassed her up
[00:12.30]Behind the wheel
[00:14.68]With your arm around your sweet one
[00:17.46]In your Oldsmobile
[00:20.35]Barrelin\' down the boulevard
[00:22.68]You\'re looking for the heart of Saturday night
[00:28.67]
[00:29.79]You got paid on Friday
[00:33.06]Your pockets are jinglin\'
[00:35.54]And you see the lights
[00:38.33]You get all tinglin\' cause you\'re cruisin\' with a 6
[00:43.34]And you\'re looking for the heart of Saturday night
[00:48.63]
[00:50.72]Then you comb your hair
[00:54.40]Shave your face
[00:57.14]Tryin\' to wipe out ev\'ry trace
[01:02.15]All the other days
[01:05.15]In the week you know that this\'ll be the Saturday
[01:09.58]You\'re reachin\' your peak
[01:11.77]
[01:12.46]Stoppin\' on the red
[01:15.00]You\'re goin\' on the green
[01:16.60]\'Cause tonight\'ll be like nothin\'
[01:20.18]You\'ve ever seen
[01:22.36]And you\'re barrelin\' down the boulevard
[01:25.95]
[01:27.67]Lookin\' for the heart of Saturday night
[01:32.25]Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
[01:38.52]Telephone\'s ringin\'; it\'s your second cousin
[01:43.88]Is it the barmaid that\'s smilin\' from the corner of her eye?
[01:50.04]Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
[01:53.99]
[01:54.77]Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
[01:59.46]\'Cause you\'re dreamin\' of them Saturdays that came before
[02:04.69]And now you\'re stumblin\'
[02:06.65]You\'re stumblin\' onto the heart of Saturday night
[02:14.41]那长长的思念！ 即便是如愿以偿， 要想见到你， 我还得经受各种磨难
[02:35.82]Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
[02:42.57]Telephone\'s ringin\'; it\'s your second cousin
[02:47.48]And the barmaid is smilin\' from the corner of her eye
[02:52.91]Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
[02:58.10]
[02:58.70]Makes it kind of special down in the core
[03:03.22]And you\'re dreamin\' of them Saturdays that came before
[03:08.73]It\'s found you stumblin\'
[03:10.67]Stumblin\' onto the heart of Saturday night
[03:18.43]And you\'re stumblin\'
[03:21.35]Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night
[03:29.38]And you\'re stumblin\'
[03:32.01]Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night
[03:39.81]And you\'re stumblin\'
[03:42.64]Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night
[03:50.88]And you\'re stumblin\'
[03:53.29]Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night
[04:00.82]
