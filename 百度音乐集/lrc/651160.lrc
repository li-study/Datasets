[00:15.16]I took my love, I took it down
[00:21.82]I climbed a mountain and I turned around
[00:27.61]And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
[00:34.31]Till the landslide brought me down

[00:41.47]Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
[00:48.19]Can the child within my heart rise above?
[00:55.18]Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
[01:02.16]Can I handle the seasons of my life?
[01:10.83]
[01:23.35]Well, I've been afraid of changing
[01:29.28]'Cause I've built my life around you
[01:37.35]But time makes you bolder

[03:01.77]Climb a mountain and turn around
[03:07.81]And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
[03:14.93]Well, the landslide will bring it down
[03:21.88]And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
[03:31.70]Well, the landslide will bring it down
