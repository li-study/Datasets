[00:00.53](I do swear that I'll aways be there.
[00:13.36]I'd give anything and everything and I will always care.
[00:25.31]Through weakness and strength,
[00:28.84]happiness and sorrow, for better or worse,
[00:36.38]I will love you with every beat of my heart.)
[01:11.80]From this moment life has begun
[01:19.40]From this moment you are the one
[01:25.68]Right beside you is where I belong
[01:31.61]From this moment on
[01:38.57]From this moment I have been blessed
[01:43.80]I live only for your happiness
[01:49.65]And for your love I'd give my last breath
[01:56.99]From this moment on
[02:04.24]I give my hand to you with all my heart
[02:09.34]Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
[02:17.01]You and I will never be apart
[02:23.56]My dreams came true because of you
[02:38.39]From this moment as long as I live
[02:43.32]I will love you, I promise you this
[02:49.73]There is nothing I wouldn't give
[02:56.19]From this moment on
[03:18.43]You're the reason I believe in love
[03:24.02]And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
[03:30.66]All we need is just the two of us
[03:38.30]My dreams came true because of you
[03:53.42]From this moment as long as I live
[04:02.50]I will love you, I promise you this
[04:10.50]There is nothing I wouldn't give
[04:16.50]From this moment on
[04:19.58]I will love you as long as I live
[04:27.32]From this moment on
