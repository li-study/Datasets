[00:01.70]It's true, we're all a little insane
[00:11.24]But it's so clear
[00:15.21]Now that I'm unchained
[00:20.87]
[00:21.50]Fear is only in our minds
[00:26.33]Taking over all the time
[00:31.22]Fear is only in our minds
[00:35.59]but its taking over all the time
[00:47.37]
[00:50.93]You poor sweet innocent thing
[00:55.90]Dry your eyes and testify
[01:00.62]You know you live to break me- don't deny
[01:07.72]Sweet sacrifice
[01:10.90]
[01:13.31]One day I'm gonna forget your name
[01:23.13]And one sweet day,
[01:26.39]you're gonna drown in my lost pain
[01:32.84]
[01:33.20]Fear is only in our minds
[01:38.04]Taking over all the time
[01:42.98]Fear is only in our minds
[01:47.42]but its taking over all the time
[01:57.48]You poor sweet innocent thing
[02:02.67]Dry your eyes and testify
[02:07.52]And oh you love to hate me don't you, honey?
[02:14.29]I'm your sacrifice.
[02:18.56]I dream in darkness
[02:20.75]I sleep to die e
[02:23.25]Raise the silence
[02:25.83]Erase my life
[02:26.84]Do you wonder why you hate?
[02:28.22](Our burning ashes)
[02:30.67](Blacken the day)
[02:31.73]Are you still too weak
[02:32.70](A world of nothingness)
[02:34.17]to survive your mistakes?
[02:35.63](Blow me away)
[02:39.57]You poor sweet innocent thing
[02:44.64]Dry your eyes and testify
[02:49.64]You know you live to break me- don't deny
[02:56.71]Sweet sacrifice
