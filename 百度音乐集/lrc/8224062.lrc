[00:09.47]Tall and tan and young and lovely
[00:12.25]The girl from Ipanema goes walking
[00:17.06]And when she passes each one she passes goes ah
[00:21.57]When she walks she's like a samba that
[00:28.74]Swings so cool and sway so gently
[00:32.88]That when she passes each one she passes goes ah
[00:37.69]Oh  But I watch her so sadly
[00:47.09]How can I tell her he loves her?
[00:55.68]Yes  I would give my heart gladly
[01:04.07]But each day when she walks to the sea
[01:09.13]She looks straight ahead not at me
[01:13.33]Tall and tan and young and lovely
[01:17.88]The girl from Ipanema goes walking
[01:21.70]And when she passes I smiles
[01:25.22]But she doesn't see
[01:28.48]
[01:42.74]Oh  But I watch her so sadly
[01:53.04]How can I tell her I loves her
[02:00.24]Yes  I would give my heart gladly
[02:09.38]But each day when she walks to the sea
[02:13.83]She looks straight ahead not at me
[02:17.45]Tall and tan and young and lovely
[02:22.04]The girl from Ipanema goes walking
[02:25.97]And when she passes I smiles
[02:31.36]But she doesn't see
[02:33.62]And when she passes I smiles
[02:37.24]But she doesn't see
[02:38.90]No she doesn't see
[02:41.65]She just doesn't see
[02:41.71]She just doesn't see
[02:44.75]No she doesn't see
