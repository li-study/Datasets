[00:30]Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
[00:33]Is when I search for the light
[00:35]Pick up my pen and start to write
[00:37]I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
[00:40]Without fear
[00:43]Insomnia
[00:48]I can't get no sleep
[01:19]I used to worry
[01:20]Thought I was going mad in a hurry
[01:22]Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
[01:26]No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
[01:31]Insomnia please release me
[01:33]And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
[01:38]Tearing off tights with my teeth
[01:41]But there's no release, no peace
[01:43]I toss and turn without cease
[01:45]Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
[01:49]At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
[01:55]But now I keep myself pepped
[01:56]Deeper still, that night
[01:59]I write by candlelight, I find insight
[02:01]Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
[02:05]This insomniac, take an original tack
[02:08]Keep the beast in my nature
[02:10]Under ceaseless attack
[02:11]I gets no sleep
[02:14]I can't get no sleep
[02:32]I can't get no sleep
[02:47]I can't get no sleep
[03:02]I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep
[03:17]I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep
