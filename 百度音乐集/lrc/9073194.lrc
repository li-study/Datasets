[00:18.00]I used to buy my faith in worship,
[00:23.00]But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped.
[00:26.00]I used to worry about the future
[00:30.00]But then I throw my caution to the wind.

[00:58.00]Got canned heat in my heals tonight baby
[01:03.00]I feel the thunder see the lightning
[01:07.00]I know this anger's heaven sent.
[01:11.00]So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
