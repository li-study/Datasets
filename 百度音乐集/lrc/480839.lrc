[00:00.00]Travis - Battleships
[00:30.53]
[00:32.71]When will you carry me home
[00:37.09]like the wounded star in the movie
[00:40.73]When will you carry me home
[00:44.87]take it back to the start when you knew me
[00:49.74]
[00:49.94]Cause\' when you talk to me that way,
[00:54.08]I\'ll be a million miles away
[00:58.25]I guess it\'s just another day in love
[01:05.61]
[01:07.09]We\'re battleships,
[01:11.11]driftin\' in an alley river
[01:15.47]Takin\' hits,
[01:19.58]sinking it\'s now or never
[01:22.60]
[01:23.14]Overboard, drownin\' in a sea of love
[01:31.31]and hate but it\'s too late
[01:34.70]Battleship down
[01:37.88]
[01:41.14]When will you figure it out
[01:45.27]that you\'re not always right little darlin\'
[01:49.34]When will you figure it out
[01:53.56]that it\'s not worth the fight little darlin’
[01:57.45]
[01:57.85]Cause\' when you can\'t think what to say,
[02:01.75]you go and throw it all away
[02:05.92]I guess it\'s just another day in love
[02:13.42]
[02:14.62]We\'re battleships,
[02:19.01]driftin\' in an alley river
[02:23.17]Takin\' hits,
[02:27.25]sinking it\'s now or never
[02:31.45]Overboard, drownin\' in a sea of love
[02:39.45]and hate but it\'s too late
[02:42.79]Battleship down
[02:45.96]
[03:05.67]But your too smarter
[03:09.99]and I\'m too dumb
[03:14.62]With no heart in the middle
[03:20.66]
[03:22.67]We\'re battleships,
[03:27.01]driftin\' in an alley river
[03:31.06]Takin\' hits,
[03:35.09]sinking it\'s now or never
[03:39.28]Overboard, falling into the ocean
[03:47.34]Ship to shore,
[03:51.48]drownin\' in a sea of love
[03:55.04]and hate but it\'s too late
[03:58.47]Battleship down
[04:02.47]---End---
