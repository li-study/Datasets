[00:02.49]In the Mirror
[00:10.58]
[00:32.76]Days are coming
[00:35.36]Days are vanishing
[00:40.19]Look into my eyes do you belive in the day
[00:47.99]Changing all the past years?
[00:52.01]When you hold the knife into your hands
[00:58.83]I want to feel it
[01:03.90]I am the owner of every part
[01:08.81]Of your thought and sence
[01:12.49]Of your thought and sence
[01:18.26]
[01:18.62]In the mirror
[01:23.74]Steel by your side
[01:27.59]I can see you when
[01:29.20]I close my eyes
[01:33.79]In the mirror
[01:37.82]Steel by your side
[01:42.61]When will see you
[01:45.09]In the other side

[02:06.11]You are trying to control the situation
[02:13.89]You are aware it is over
[02:21.67]Can you feel it?
[02:24.56]I am the air that you breathe
[02:29.45]Your sleepless night will be mine
[02:37.29]Tell me the truth about your own
[02:42.10]When you see your face on the other side
[02:51.80]
[02:52.09]In the mirror
[02:55.76]Steel by your side
[03:00.52]I can see you when

[04:18.58]I can see you when
[04:20.96]I close my eyes
[04:25.57]In the mirror
[04:29.43]Steel by your side
[04:34.26]When will see you
