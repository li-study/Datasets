[00:00.00]Evanescence - Bring Me To Life
[00:06.63](feat. Paul McCoy)
[00:08.63]
[00:10.63]How can you see into my eyes
[00:16.69]like open doors.
[00:20.79]Leading you down into my core
[00:26.64]Where I've become so numb.
[00:31.54]Without a soul
[00:36.69]My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
[00:41.84]until you find it there and lead it back home.
[00:52.42]Wake me up.
[00:53.37]Wake me up inside.
[00:54.81]I can't wake up.
[00:55.85]Wake me up inside.
[00:57.23]Save me.
[00:58.39]Call my name and save me from the dark.
[01:02.24]Wake me up.
[01:03.37]Bid my blood to run.
[01:04.82]I can't wake up.
[01:05.77]Before I come undone.
[01:07.21]Save me.
[01:08.35]Save me from the nothing I've become.
[01:13.60]
[01:14.81]Now that I know what I'm without
[01:20.84]you can't just leave me.
[01:23.92]Breathe into me and make me real
[01:31.18]Bring me to life.
[01:36.82]
[01:37.61]Wake me up.
[01:38.50]Wake me up inside.
[01:39.88]I can't wake up.
[01:41.00]Wake me up inside.
[01:42.29]Save me.
[01:43.59]Call my name and save me from the dark.
[01:47.60]Wake me up.
[01:48.57]Bid my blood to run.
[01:49.95]I can't wake up.
[01:50.96]Before I come undone.
[01:52.37]Save me.
[01:53.62]Save me from the nothing I've become.
[01:58.96]Bring me to life.
[02:03.72]I've been living a lie
[02:05.84]There's nothing inside.
[02:08.52]Bring me to life.
[02:14.65]
[02:17.59]Frozen inside without your touch,
[02:23.60]without your love, darling.
[02:27.39]Only you are the life among the dead.
[02:37.93]All of this sight
[02:39.10]I can't believe I couldn't see
[02:40.59]Kept in the dark
[02:41.47]but you were there in front of me
[02:43.10]I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems.
[02:45.43]I've got to open my eyes to everything.
[02:48.16]Without a thought
[02:49.07]Without a voice
[02:49.86]Without a soul
[02:50.67]Don't let me die here
[02:52.56]There must be something wrong.
[02:54.30]Bring me to life.
[02:58.10]Wake me up.
[02:59.02]Wake me up inside.
[03:00.52]I can't wake up.
[03:01.52]Wake me up inside.
[03:02.86]Save me.
[03:04.10]Call my name and save me from the dark.
[03:08.05]Wake me up.
[03:09.00]Bid my blood to run.
[03:10.45]I can't wake up.
[03:11.51]Before I come undone.
[03:13.00]Save me.
[03:14.10]Save me from the nothing I've become.
[03:19.58]Bring me to life.
[03:24.18]I've been living a lie
[03:26.64]There's nothing inside.
[03:29.24]Bring me to life
[03:43.42]
