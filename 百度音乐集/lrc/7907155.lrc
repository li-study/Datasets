[00:00.00]Atozzio - Change Of Heart
[00:00.25]
[00:01.47]An address book full of numbers
[00:08.32]With no one I really wanna call
[00:14.42]I've been thinkin about you all summer
[00:20.56]Your friends say you're comin back this fall
[00:24.58]
[00:27.09]I know those things I said to you before, girl
[00:33.59]But that was when I didn't wanna fall (Woo baby)
[00:39.70]But now I really feel I'm going under
[00:45.30]Cause I didn't read the writings on the wall
[00:50.51]
[00:51.28]I spend my whole day thinking of you
[00:54.39]And everything I said I wouldn't do (oooo baby)
[00:57.67]But if we get together I know you will hold me down (I know you'll hold me down)
[01:03.50]I know I said I wasn't lookin for love (I wasn't)
[01:07.26]But you're the type of girl I know I could trust (I know it)
[01:10.40]And if we get together I know you will hold me down (me down)
[01:15.20]
[01:15.95]And now I have a change of heart
[01:18.15](Oooo) heart
[01:19.71]Change of heart
[01:21.35]You make me have a change
[01:22.69]And now I have a change of heart
[01:24.38](Oooo) heart
[01:26.09]Change of heart
[01:28.83]
[01:30.77]Do you think about me still I wonder?
[01:37.02]Cause I don't hear from you anymore, at all (anymore at all)
[01:43.28]I used to be the one that you'd run to (you'd run to)
[01:49.92]Any time you needed just to talk
[01:53.68]
[01:56.40]And now I'm all alone & it's my fault that I let you get away
[02:02.77]I broke the chance to love you
[02:05.11]And there's no one who makes me feel this way
[02:09.89]It's getting harder pretending that I'm cool & I'm okay
[02:16.16](ok, ok, okaaaaay, yeaaah)
[02:22.85]
[02:23.86]I spend my whole day thinking of you (I spend my whole day)
[02:26.93]And everything I said I wouldn't do
[02:29.99]But if we get together I know you will hold me down (I know you'll hold me down)
[02:36.28]I know I said I wasn't lookin for love (I know I said)
[02:39.62]But you're the type of girl I know I could trust
[02:42.83]And if we get together I know you will hold me down
[02:47.20]
[02:47.73]Cause baby...
[03:58.16][02:48.17]And now I have a change of heart
[04:01.02][02:50.35](Oooo) heart
[04:02.25][02:52.12]Change of heart
[04:04.47][02:54.41]And now I have a change of heart
[04:07.36][02:57.16](Oooo) heart
[04:08.61][02:58.50]Change of heart
[04:10.29][03:00.63]
[03:03.80]What do I have to do?
[03:07.07]Yeah yeah yeah
[03:10.02]To bring me back to you (oh girl)
[03:16.36]If you know what I'm going through
[03:21.83]Maybe you'd give me the chance to prove that I...
[03:31.80]
[03:33.90]I spend my whole day thinking of you
[03:37.01]And everything I said I wouldn't do (baby)
[03:40.24]But if we get together I know you will hold me down (down)
[03:46.45]I know I said I wasn't lookin for love
[03:49.69]But you're the type of girl I know I could trust
