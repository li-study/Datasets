[00:09.29]In the hope I'll forget I'll wait
[00:14.10]It's a chance I'll take oh yeah
[00:19.20]In the hope I'll forget I'll wait
[00:24.23]For the time
[00:27.68]
[00:29.53]In the spring I'll watch my step
[00:34.30]While the night-time passes by
[00:39.42]When a smile suits me all alone
[00:44.38]I'll be fine
[00:47.31]
[00:49.67]There's got to be a better song to sing
[00:52.53]Before I hang upon your shoulder
[00:55.07]Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
[00:59.55]There's got to be a better song to sing
[01:02.45]That makes a lonely one less cold oh
[01:05.23]Before I hang upon your shoulder and cry
[01:08.50]
[01:49.25]Watching friends playing in the dirt
[01:54.07]Feeling hard but feeling hurt
[01:59.18]By the sadness that wastes my time
[02:04.33]It's a crime
[02:06.26]
[02:09.45]Counting acts which I must add
[02:14.31]To collect sad memories
[02:19.37]From a past I'd soon forget
[02:24.62]Swap or leave
[02:27.70]
[02:29.83]There's got to be a better song to sing
[02:32.79]Before I hang upon your shoulder
[02:35.32]Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
[02:39.69]There's got to be a better song to sing
[02:42.68]That makes a lonely one less cold oh
[02:45.06]
[02:45.81]Before I hang upon your shoulder and cry
[02:50.27]At the gate I'll wave goodbye
[02:54.98]To the friends that were my lies
[02:59.77]And I'll see them off at dawn
[03:05.12]Feeling wise
[03:10.10]Feeling wise
[03:15.08]Feeling wise
[03:18.56]
