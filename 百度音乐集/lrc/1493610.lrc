[02:39.03][01:42.29][00:54.96][00:13.52]
[00:14.52]In the day we sweat it out in the streets
[00:17.91]of a runaway american dream
[00:21.00]At night we ride through mansions
[00:23.39]of glory in suicide machines
[00:27.88]Sprung from cages out on highway 9,
[00:31.06]Chrome wheeled,fuel injected and steppin'out over the line
[00:36.68]oh~Baby this town rips the bones from your back
[00:40.93]It's a death trap,
[00:42.33]it's a suicide rap
[00:44.16]We gotta get out while we're young
[00:47.26]`cause tramps like us,
[00:49.54] baby we were born to run
[01:03.56]Wendy let me in i wanna be your friend
[01:06.74]I want to guard your dreams and visions
[01:09.99]Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
[01:13.17]And strap your hands across my engines
[01:16.51]Together we could break this trap
[01:19.53]We'll run till we drop,
[01:21.69] baby we'll never go back
[01:25.23]Will you walk with me out on the wire
[01:29.44]`cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider
[01:32.86]But i gotta find out how it feels
[01:35.92]I want to know if love is wild,
[01:37.91] girl i want to know if love is real
[02:12.19]Beyond the palace hemi-powered drones
[02:15.30]scream down the boulevard
[02:18.59]The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
[02:21.96]And the boys try to look so hard
[02:25.26]The amusement park rises bold and stark
[02:28.69]Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
[02:31.78]I wanna die with you wendy on the streets tonight
[02:35.45]In an everlasting kiss
[03:05.69]The highway's jammed with broken heroes
[03:08.51] on a last chance power drive
[03:11.48]Everybody's out on the run tonight
[03:14.65]but there's no place left to hide
[03:18.44]Together wendy we'll live with the sadness
[03:21.83]I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
[03:27.33]o!~Someday girl i don't know when
[03:30.99]we're gonna get to that place
[03:33.44]Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
[03:37.59]But till then tramps like us baby we were born to run
