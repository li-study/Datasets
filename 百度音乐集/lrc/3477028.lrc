[00:27.53]View from a bridge,
[00:28.69]
[00:33.74]View from a bridge,
[00:35.26]
[00:39.45]I guess it all began about a year ago
[00:43.06]Like a cheap love magazine
[00:45.98]You know the kind you read aboutAnd have to laugh
[00:49.48]At the pages in between
[00:52.27]Now I can't believe that fool inside is me
[00:56.76]
[00:58.84]'Cos I just can't face the world I've grown to see
[01:03.58]
[01:06.33]View from a bridge,
[01:07.16]
[01:09.10]can't take anymore
[01:10.72]
[01:12.60]View from a bridge,
[01:14.11]
[01:15.70]can't take anymore
[01:16.54]
[01:18.17]I saw you kissing her
[01:19.89]I saw you making her
[01:21.36]In the soft sheets in between
[01:25.02]
[01:25.67]But when you turned around
[01:27.47]I saw your eyes were fire
[01:28.54]
[01:29.57]And you crashed out all my dreams
[01:32.17]And like a fool I just stood there And let it go
[01:35.86]
[01:37.49]I should have fought right back And let my feelings show
[01:42.30]
[01:45.20]View from a bridge,
[01:46.37]
[01:48.53]can't take anymore
[01:49.57]
[01:51.76]View from a bridge,
[01:52.43]
[01:55.00]can't take anymore
[01:55.89]
[01:58.30]You sure as hell knew how To make a fool out of me
[02:03.50]Well you cut me down
[02:05.92]For the things you want
[02:07.35]And now it's killing me
[02:08.95]
[02:23.58]But then a voice said jump
[02:25.47]And I just let go
[02:27.07]And I'm floating out in space
[02:30.23]But then I feel your arms
[02:31.98]And I turn around
[02:33.40]To a ghost without a face
[02:37.20]And I just don't know
[02:38.35]What's fact or fantasy
[02:43.37]'Cos when I look below the bridge I see it's me
[02:47.36]
