[00:11.00]
[00:13.78]I fall asleep by the telephone.
[00:16.71]It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone.
[00:20.23]Tell me, where have you been?
[00:25.72]I found a note with another name.
[00:28.91]You blow a kiss but it just don't feel the same.
[00:32.20]Cauz I can feel that you're gone.
[00:36.00]
[00:37.25]I can't bite my tongue forever,
[00:39.96]while you try to play it cool.
[00:43.14]You can hide behind your stories,
[00:46.01]but don't take me for a fool!
[00:48.40]
[00:49.10]You can tell me that there's nobody else (but I feel it!)
[00:54.62]You can tell me that you're home by yourself (but I see it!)
[01:00.84]You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want,
[01:06.55]but I know, I know
[01:11.72]Your love is just a lie! (Lie! Lie!)
[01:17.54]It's nothing but a lie! (Lie! Lie!)
[01:24.75]
[01:25.83]You look so innocent,
[01:28.89]But the guilt in your voice gives you away.
[01:31.93]Yeah, you know what I mean (know what I mean)
[01:37.11]How does it feel when you kiss when you know that I trust you
[01:40.83]And do you think about me when he fucks you?
[01:43.80]Could you be more obscene? (be more obscene)
[01:48.02]
[01:49.06]So don't try to say you're sorry,
[01:52.03]or try to make it right.
[01:55.07]And don't waste your breath
[01:56.84]because it's too late, it's too late!
[02:00.14]
[02:00.84]You can tell me that there's nobody else (but I feel it!)
[02:06.77]You can tell me that you're home by yourself (but I see it!)
[02:12.57]You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want,
[02:18.50]but I know, I know
[02:23.84]Your love is just a lie! (Lie!) Lie! (Lie!)
[02:29.36]It's nothing but a lie! (Lie!) Lie! (Lie!)
[02:35.75]You're nothing but a lie!
[02:42.70]
[02:54.60]You can tell me that there's nobody else (but I feel it!)
[03:00.75]You can tell me that you're home by yourself (but I see it!)
[03:06.76]You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want,
[03:12.63]but I know, I know
[03:17.66]Your love is just a lie!
[03:21.95]I know, you're nothing but a lie! (Lie!) Lie! (Lie!)
[03:29.26]You're nothing but a  lie! (Lie!) Lie! (Lie!)
[03:35.13]Your love is just a lie!
