[00:09.00]《Over The Rainbow》
[00:13.50]Imagine there's no heaven
[00:19.77]It's easy if you try
[00:26.19]No hell below us
[00:32.55]Above us only sky
[00:39.00]Imagine all the people
[00:44.88]Living for today
[00:51.78]Imagine there's no countries
[00:58.14]It isn't hard to do
[01:04.90]Nothing to kill or die for
[01:10.97]And no religion too
[01:17.36]Imagine all the people
[01:23.30]Living life in peace
[01:30.87]You may say,
[01:32.45]I'm a dreamer
[01:37.10]But I'm not the only one
[01:43.00]I hope some day
[01:45.30]You'll join us
[01:49.66]And the world will be as one
[01:56.00]Imagine no possessions
[02:02.45]I wonder if you can
[02:08.80]No need for greed or hunger
[02:15.22]A brotherhood of man
[02:21.60]Imagine all the people
[02:27.54]Sharing all the world
[02:35.03]You may say,
[02:36.77]I'm a dreamer
[02:41.30]But I'm not the only one
[02:47.38]I hope some day
[02:49.54]You'll join us
[02:53.97]And the world will be as one
