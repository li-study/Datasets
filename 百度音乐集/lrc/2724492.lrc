[00:25.37]Wonderful Tonight
[00:32.90]Sing by Eric Clapton
[00:37.34]For Ch.y
[00:38.34]
[00:55.20]It's late in the evening
[01:02.45]She's wondering what clothes to wear
[01:09.07]She puts on her make up
[01:14.76]And brushes her long blond hair
[01:22.42]And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
[01:34.56]And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
[01:45.65]
[01:57.00]We go to a party
[02:03.13]And everyone turns to see
[02:09.91]This beautiful lady
[02:16.52]as walking around with me
[02:23.22]And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
[02:34.96]And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
[02:45.62]
[02:46.85]And I feel wonderful because I see the love
[02:57.25]light in your eyes
[03:01.84]And the wonder of it all
[03:07.86]is that you just don't realize
[03:13.70]How much I love you
[03:28.57]
[03:43.91]It's time to go home now
[03:50.75]And I've got an aching head
[03:56.56]So I give her the car keys
[04:04.19]And she helps me to bed
[04:10.90]And then I tell her
[04:16.56]As I turn off the light
[04:22.71]I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight"
[04:34.48]"Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight"
