[00:12.72]Christmas From The Heart
[00:15.53]
[00:18.28]What Child is this, who laid to rest,
[00:26.22]On Mary's lap is sleeping?
[00:33.75]Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
[00:41.39]While shepherds watch are keeping?
[00:49.35]
[00:49.71]This, this is Christ the King
[00:56.61]Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
[01:04.36]Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
[01:11.78]The Babe, the Son of Mary.
[01:19.16]
[01:26.87]Why lies He in such mean estate
[01:34.47]Where ox and ass are feeding?
[01:41.78]Good Christian, fear: for sinners here,
[01:49.43]The silent Word is pleading.
[01:57.17]
[01:57.63]Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through,
[02:04.66]The Cross be borne, for me, for you:
[02:11.97]Hail, hail, the Word made flesh,
[02:19.72]The Babe, the Son of Mary!
[02:27.24]So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh;
[02:34.69]Come peasant, king to own Him.
[02:41.98]The King of Kings salvation brings;
[02:49.67]Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
[02:57.34]
[02:57.58]Raise, raise, the song on high,
[03:12.62]Joy joy for Christ is born,
[03:19.71]The Babe, the Son of Mary!
