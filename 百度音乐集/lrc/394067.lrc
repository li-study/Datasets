[00:18.27]Somebody said you got a new friend
[00:26.13]Does she love you better than I can?
[00:32.83]There's a big black sky over my town
[00:41.13]I know where you're at, I bet she's around
[00:46.43]
[00:50.74]Yeah, I know it's stupid
[00:54.91]I just gotta see it for myself
[00:57.35]
[00:59.24]I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
[01:07.25]I'm right over here, why can't you see me, ohh
[01:13.19]
[01:15.43]I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo
[01:23.58]I keep dancing on my own

[01:48.10]Stilettos and broken bottles
[01:52.41]I'm spinning around in circles
[01:56.04]I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh

[02:29.12]
[02:45.59]So far away but still so near
[02:49.96]The lights go on, the music dies
[02:53.71]But you don't see me standing here
[02:58.08]I just came to say goodbye
[03:02.13]I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
