[00:15.89]Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
[00:22.55]You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
[00:29.34]I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
[00:36.37]And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
[00:43.64]This is getting serious
[00:50.92]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[00:56.03]Don't say what you're about to say
[01:03.08]Look back before you leave my life
[01:10.07]Be sure before you close that door
[01:17.11]Before you roll those dice
[01:24.24]Baby think twice
[01:31.26]Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
[01:40.54]For the fire and the faith that was you and me
[01:47.47]Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
[01:55.11]'Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
[02:02.53]But baby this is serious
[02:09.60]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[02:14.62]Don't say what you're about to say
[02:21.57]Look back before you leave my life
[02:28.72]Be sure before you close that door
[02:35.76]Before you roll those dice
[02:42.83]Baby think twice
[02:59.45]Baby this is serious
[03:06.80]Are you thinking 'bout you or us
[03:15.62]Don't say what you're about to say
[03:22.65]Look back before you leave my life
[03:29.59]Be sure before you close that door
[03:36.42]Before you roll those dice
[03:44.30]Don't do what you're about to do
[03:51.12]My everything depends on you
[03:57.91]And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
[04:04.82]Before you roll those dice
[04:12.18]Baby think twice
