[00:11.88]Hiding away losing the day
[00:18.06][03:37.11]As if it doesn't really matter
[00:21.91]Saying goodbye, scared to say why
[00:27.86]The fading will shadow over
[00:32.97]Show me some faith now
[00:37.99]Trust me somehow
[00:40.70][01:50.29][02:40.15]Why are we keeping a secret
[00:45.53][01:55.12][02:44.93]Why are we hiding ourselves away
[00:53.04][02:03.03][02:52.82]Anyway we can't hide away
[00:57.92][02:07.61][02:57.36]I don't wanna fake it
[01:00.66][02:10.31][02:59.99]I wanna make you believe
[01:04.62]What I'm saying
[01:07.41][02:17.04][03:16.78]I won't let you hide away
[01:14.11]Yeah
[01:21.59]Where do we go
[01:24.11]How do we know
[01:27.76]What we are really after
[01:31.59]Sometimes it's clear when you're here
[01:37.60]Nothing can shadow over
[01:42.82]I need some faith now to trust you somehow
[02:14.30][03:04.10]What I say
[02:20.87]Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm losing
[02:25.50]Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm OK
[02:30.66]Turn around, look around, go around in circle
[02:35.31]To run away, drift away, don't hide away
[03:07.81]Oh what I say
[03:13.29]Believe what I say
[03:23.93]Hide away
[03:31.09]Hiding away losing a day
