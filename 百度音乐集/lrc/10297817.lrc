[00:15.89]The first time I saw you
[00:20.66]Oh, you looked so fine
[00:25.34]And I had a feeling
[00:29.28]One day you'd be mine
[00:35.83]Honey you came along and captured my heart
[00:43.18]Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
[00:49.07]When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
[00:53.88]Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
[00:57.45]Oh, Oh, Ooh, Ooh, Oh
[01:01.12]
[01:03.20]Penny lover, my love's on fire
[01:08.04]Penny lover, you're my one desire
[01:14.06]Tell me baby could this be true
[01:18.79]That I could need someone, like I need you
[01:23.26]
[01:24.04]Nights warm and tender
[01:28.29]Lying next to you
[01:33.67]Girl I surrender
[01:37.53]Oh, what more can I do
[01:43.97]I've spent all of my life in search of your love
[01:50.57]Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
[01:56.90]Don't you ever take your sweet love away
[02:01.61]Girl I'll do anything, just please stay

[02:13.63]I don't understand it, Oh what's come over me
[02:17.83]But I'm not gonna worry, no not anymore
[02:29.09]'Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
[02:37.37]That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
[02:44.40]When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
[02:49.26]With a love like yours, it's hard to resist
[02:53.54]Ooh, Ooh, Oh
