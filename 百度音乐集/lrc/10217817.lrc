[00:00.00]Westlife - That's Where You Find Love
[00:00.49]
[00:01.53]In your eyes
[00:04.10]I found the greatest prize
[00:08.94]You and I could not be closer
[00:13.13]
[00:15.79]And in your arms
[00:19.54]Is everything I want
[00:24.45]Now I know my search is over
[00:28.45]
[00:32.20]And I don't know where you take me
[00:38.98]But it's exactly where I wanna be
[00:43.89]
[00:46.01]It's where the stars line up
[00:49.89]It's where the oceans touch
[00:53.86]It's in a place you've never been that feels like home
[01:01.86]It's in the air right now
[01:05.70]It's where you give your all
[01:08.42]And give a little more
[01:12.30]I've never been so sure
[01:16.58]That's where you find love
[01:20.05]
[01:23.30]People pass
[01:25.96]And listen to us laugh
[01:30.96]Wishing that they had the same thing
[01:35.65]
[01:36.78]And our friends they ask
[01:41.59]How we made it last
[01:46.37]I just smile and say the same thing
[01:50.75]
[01:54.22]I'm not sure how we got here
[02:01.00]Baby I'm just glad that you got here
[02:06.72]
[02:08.00]It's where the stars line up
[02:11.81]It's where the oceans touch
[02:15.66]It's in a place you've never been that feels like home
[02:23.75]It's in the air right now
[02:27.60]It's where you give your all
[02:30.32]And give a little more
[02:34.41]I've never been so sure
[02:38.49]That's where you find love
[02:46.19]That's where you find love
[02:54.49]
[02:55.18]It's where the stars line up
[02:59.15]It's where the oceans touch
[03:03.25]It's in a place you've never been that feels like home
[03:08.71]
[03:11.03]It's in the air right now
[03:14.59]It's where you give your all
[03:17.50]And give a little more
[03:21.34]I've never been this sure
[03:25.40]That's where you find love
[03:29.69]
[03:30.59]Find love
[03:33.41]That's where you find love
