[00:07.31]The lowlands of holland
[00:11.29]
[00:16.58]On the night that I was married
[00:22.78]And upon my marriage bed
[00:28.38]There came a bold sea captain
[00:34.48]And he stood at my bedhead
[00:40.11]Saying, "arise, arise, young wedded man
[00:46.23]And come along with me
[00:51.83]To the lowlands of Holland
[00:58.36]To fight the enemy"
[01:15.64]Now then, Holland is a lovely land
[01:21.72]And upon it grows fine grain
[01:27.22]Surely 'tis a place of residence
[01:33.57]For a soldier to remain
[01:39.28]Where the sugar cane is plentiful
[01:45.57]And the tea grows on the tree
[01:51.22]Well, I never had but the one sweetheart
[01:57.55]And now he's gone far away from me
[02:03.52]
[02:50.82]I will wear no staysail around my waist
[02:57.07]Nor combs are in my hair
[03:02.69]I will wear no scarf around my neck
[03:08.78]for to save my beauty there
[03:14.81]And never will I marry
[03:20.91]Not until the day that I die
[03:26.43]Since these four winds and these stormy seas
[03:34.63]Came between my love and I
