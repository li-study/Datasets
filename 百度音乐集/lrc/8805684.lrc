[00:05.89]
[00:33.78]I needed the shelter of someone's arms
[00:38.21]and there you were
[00:41.56]I needed someone to understand
[00:43.58]my ups and downs
[00:45.92]and there you were
[00:49.25]With sweet love and devotion
[00:53.09]Deeply touching my emotion
[00:55.91]I want to stop and thank you baby
[00:59.68]I want to stop and thank you baby
[01:03.49]
[01:03.92]Oh Yes,
[01:05.15]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[01:10.05]Feels So Fine
[01:12.66]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[01:17.00]
[01:20.23]I close my eyes at night
[01:23.79]Wondering where would I be without you in my life
[01:28.01]Everything I did was just a bore
[01:31.51]Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
[01:35.18]But You brighten up for me all of my days
[01:39.65]With a love so sweet in so many ways
[01:42.81]I want to stop and thank you baby
[01:46.14]I want to stop and thank you baby
[01:49.52]
[01:50.29]Oh Yes,
[01:51.53]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[01:56.02]And my sugar sometimes
[01:59.21]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[02:03.51]
[02:21.86]You were better for me than I was for myself
[02:25.80]For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
[02:29.30]I want to stop and thank you baby
[02:32.61]I just want to stop and thank you baby
[02:36.34]
[02:37.92]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[02:45.55]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[02:53.31]How sweet it is to be loved by you
[03:00.98]How sweet it is to be loved by you
