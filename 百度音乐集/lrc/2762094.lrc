[00:05.00]
[02:28.03][00:11.11]God, it was late
[02:29.95][00:14.00]I was drunk
[02:32.01][00:15.87]You saw me
[02:38.17][00:21.09]The one by my side
[00:24.55]Wasn't you
[02:48.85][02:43.28][00:26.47]I'm sorry
[00:31.18]And I knew right then
[00:36.38]That I lost you there
[00:41.16]You took me in
[03:35.47][03:23.29][03:02.23][02:05.73][00:46.50]In spite of me
[03:07.80][02:46.85][02:09.45][00:50.56]You made me feel invited
[03:14.05][02:53.11][02:16.13][00:57.04]Nobody else
[03:17.96][02:56.95][02:20.06][01:00.90]That is what I decided
[01:08.85]Selfish and dumb
[01:11.39]Stupid and young
[01:14.56]Yeah, that's me
[01:19.09]But from all of the wrongs
[01:22.04]You make it right
[01:25.64]And forgive me
[01:29.21]It's been said before
[01:34.51]But I'll try once more
[01:39.30]You are the one
[02:41.06]He wasn't you
[03:25.50][03:04.93]You're here
[03:42.45](End)
