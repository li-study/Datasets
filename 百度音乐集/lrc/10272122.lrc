[00:24.53]Make a deal, trade your soul for certainty.
[00:31.69]I've got the devil on my shoulder and an angel at my feet.
[00:41.60]Don't need that look, don't need that bible fairytale
[00:47.72]of what I've done; who I've become.
[00:51.50]Oh I'm well aware but I'm so far in it..
[00:55.46]What to do oh what to do now
[01:01.41]Do I say it out loud --
[01:03.39]-- that I'm bound to back out?
[01:05.77]What to do oh what to do now
[01:08.21]from here wouldn't stay.. it's easy that way...yeah-ay..
[01:30.53]So sad that I'm the hint of life in your deserving eye
[01:37.44]when every minute you spend hoping for love and respect brings me closer to goodbye.
[01:46.97]The time will come you find out who I really am,
[01:54.41]and we'll pretend that we'll be friends
[01:59.22]oh when I do lie you'd only last a little while.
[02:03.95]What to do oh what to do now
[02:06.41]Do I say it out loud --
[02:07.99]What to do oh what to do now
[02:10.39]-- that I'm bound to back out?
[02:12.04]What to do oh what to do now
[02:14.75]told me you wouldn't stay.. it's easy that way.
[02:37.36]The evidence keeps on building and I'm sinking in defense
[02:45.43]will a measurement of intentions come -- a guilty conscience..
[02:53.80]So let the air tip the scales..
[02:57.95]let's go; one honest judge decide
[03:00.88]and you will find the facts weigh down to favor you in time..
[03:09.77]What to do oh what to do now
[03:12.20]Do I say it out loud --
[03:13.95]What to do oh what to do now
[03:16.49]-- that I'm bound to back out?
[03:18.31]What to do oh what to do now.......?
