[00:18.27]Reverend reverend is this some conspiracy?
[00:24.80]Crucified for no sins
[00:29.04]An image beneath me
[00:32.92]Whats within our plans for life
[00:37.09]It all seems so unreal
[00:40.64]I'm a man cut in half in this world
[00:44.91]Left in my misery...
[00:45.99]
[02:07.92]The reverend he turned to me
[02:11.30]Without a tear in his eyes
[02:14.54]It's nothing new for him to see
[02:17.63]I didn't ask him why
[02:20.97]I will remember
[02:23.80]The love our souls had
[02:26.92]Sworn to make
[02:28.33]Now I watch the falling rain
[02:31.23]All my mind can see
[02:33.59]Now is your (face)
[02:33.99]
[02:36.66]Well I guess
[02:37.36]You took my youth
[02:39.86]I gave it all away
[02:40.33]Like the birth of a
[02:43.20]New-found joy
[02:44.24]This love would end in rage
[02:47.63]And when she died
[02:49.30]I couldn't cry
[02:51.04]The pride within my soul
[02:54.13]You left me incomplete
[02:57.52]Memories now unfold.
[03:04.79]Believe the word
[03:07.69]I will unlock my door
[03:11.25]And pass the
[03:12.44]Cemetery gates
[03:14.71]
[03:30.65]Sometimes when I'm alone
[03:33.96]I wonder aloud
[03:37.24]If you're watching over me
[03:40.25]Some place far abound
[03:43.93]I must reverse my life
[03:47.31]I can't live in the past
[03:50.92]Then set my soul free
[03:53.94]Belong to me at last
[03:55.66]
[03:57.24]Through all those
[03:58.50]Complex years
[04:00.01]I thought I was alone
[04:03.67]I didn't care to look around
[04:06.82]And make this world my own
[04:10.20]And when she died
[04:11.89]I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
[04:13.32]Left me incomplete
[04:17.36]All alone as the memories still remain
[04:21.41]
[04:27.03]The way we were
[04:29.94]The chance to save my soul
[04:33.49]And my concern is now in vain
[04:40.36]Believe the word
[04:43.33]I will unlock my door
[04:46.69]And pass the cemetery gates
[04:49.68]
