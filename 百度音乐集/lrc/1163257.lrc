[00:47.28]In demon days, it's cold inside
[00:50.88]You don't get nobody, people sigh
[00:54.25]It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
[00:58.36]Hiding in a hole in there
[01:02.12]All the glasses are too big
[01:05.79]Bring it back, got to hold it back
[01:09.45]To let you do that yet you don't want me back
[01:13.22]Before it fall down, falling down falling down
[01:17.58]Falling out to go far from the sun
[01:23.01]
[02:56.36][02:18.21]Well these demon days are so cold inside
[02:59.98][02:22.25]It's so hard to live, and so to survive
[03:03.79][02:25.59]You can't even trust the air you breathe
[03:08.00][02:29.67]Cause Mother Earth has a soul to leave
[03:12.08][02:33.81]When lies become reality
[03:15.68][02:38.03]You love yourself because it's easy
[03:20.20][02:41.85]Pick yourself up it's a brand new day
[03:23.26][02:44.94]So turn yourself round
[03:25.15][02:46.92]Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
[03:27.49][02:49.34]Turn yourself around to the sun
[02:55.78]
[03:41.72][03:34.06]To the sun, to the sun
[03:47.42][03:36.22]To the sun, to the sun
