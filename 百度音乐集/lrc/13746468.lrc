[00:00.46]Everything is wonderful
[00:03.71]Being here is heavenly
[00:07.24]Every single day, she says
[00:10.88]Everything is free
[00:13.86]
[00:14.53]I used to be so careless
[00:17.80]As if I couldn't care less
[00:21.56]Did I have to make mistakes?
[00:24.00]When I was Mary's prayer
[00:26.78]
[00:28.65]Suddenly the heavens rolled
[00:32.11]Suddenly the rain came down
[00:35.67]Suddenly was washed away
[00:38.32]The Mary that I knew
[00:42.27]
[00:42.79]So when you find somebody who gives
[00:46.38]Think of me and celebrate
[00:49.85]I made such a big mistake
[00:52.45]When I was Mary's Prayer
[00:55.52]
[00:56.21]CHORUS:
[00:56.96]So if I say save me save me
[01:01.17]Be the light in my eyes
[01:04.06]And if I say ten Hail Mary's
[01:08.36]Leave a light on heaven for me
[01:12.73]
[01:13.36]Blessed is the one who shares
[01:16.50]The power and your beauty, Mary
[01:19.95]Blessed is the millionaire
[01:23.62]Who shares your wedding day
[01:25.40]
[01:27.26]So when you find somebody to give
[01:30.87]Think of me and celebrate
[01:34.31]I made such a big mistake
[01:36.86]When I was Mary's Prayer
[01:39.75]
[01:40.49]CHORUS (twice)
[01:41.49]So if I say save me save me
[01:45.39]Be the light in my eyes
[01:48.59]And if I say ten Hail Mary's
[01:52.97]Leave a light on heaven
[01:56.49]save me save me
[01:59.97]Be the light in my eyes
[02:02.71]And if I say ten Hail Mary's
[02:07.15]Leave a light on heaven for me
[02:11.34]
[02:11.98]If you want the fruit to fall
[02:15.16]You have to give the tree a shake
[02:18.64]But if you shake the tree too hard,
[02:22.44]The bough is gonna break
[02:25.02]
[02:26.12]And if I can't reach the top of the tree
[02:29.73]Mary you can hold me up there
[02:32.82]What I wouldn't give to be
[02:35.51]When I was Mary's prayer
[02:38.48]
[02:39.24]CHORUS (twice)
[02:39.96]So if I say save me save me
[02:44.39]Be the light in my eyes
[02:47.12]And if I say ten Hail Mary's
[02:51.57]Leave a light on heaven
[02:55.08]save me save me
[02:58.69]Be the light in my eyes
[03:01.34]And if I say ten Hail Mary's
[03:05.95]Leave a light on heaven
[03:09.32]Save me, save me
[03:12.91]Be the light in my eyes
[03:15.94]What I wouldn't give to be
[03:18.10]When I was Mary's prayer
[03:22.81]What I wouldn't give to be
[03:25.22]When I was Mary's prayer
[03:29.45]What I wouldn't give to be (save me)
[03:33.06]When I was Mary's prayer
[03:39.15]
