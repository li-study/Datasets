[00:11.29]
[00:11.81]I know there is a rainbow
[00:18.68]For me to follow
[00:23.12]To get beyond my sorrow
[00:29.04]Thunder precedes the sunlight
[00:35.82]So I'll be allright
[00:39.98]If I can find that
[00:43.55]Rainbow's end
[00:54.68]I will be allright
[00:57.36]If I can find that
[01:00.72]Rainbow's
[01:07.98]End
