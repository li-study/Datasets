[00:00.00]Did I ever tell you
[00:04.40]how you live in me
[00:08.19]Every waking moment,
[00:11.08]even in my dreams
[00:14.36]And if all this talk is crazy
[00:18.19]And you don't know what I mean
[01:29.20][00:21.47]Does it really matter
[00:25.48]Just as long as I believe
[03:08.60][02:56.02][02:51.97][02:37.14][02:29.21][02:22.20][01:51.92][01:44.08][01:37.02][00:58.92][00:44.24][00:36.42][00:29.25]I will love again
[02:26.47][01:41.35][00:33.57]Though my heart is breaking
[02:32.20][01:46.92][00:39.19]Stronger than before
[02:41.55][01:56.33][00:48.64]Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
[02:47.23][02:02.08][00:54.38]Heaven only knows,
[03:36.22][01:03.68]
[01:08.59]People never tell you
[01:11.89]The way they truly feel
[01:16.00]I would die for you gladly
[01:18.26]If I knew it was for real
[01:22.14]So if all this talk sounds crazy
[01:25.90]And the words don't come out right
[01:33.33]If it gets me through this night
[02:07.17]If I'm true to myself,
[02:09.62]nobody else
[02:11.49]can take the place of you
[02:14.77]But I've got to move on,
[02:17.12]tell me what else can I do
[02:59.36]I will love again (I will love again)
[03:06.42]One day I know,
[03:14.05]You can't stop me from loving again
[03:17.49]Breathing again
[03:19.25]Feeling again
[03:21.60]I know, one day, I'll love again
