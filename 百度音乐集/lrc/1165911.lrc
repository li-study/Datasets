[00:38.00]I don't know what it is
[00:40.00]That makes me feel alive
[00:43.00]I don't know how to wake
[00:44.00]The things that sleep inside
[00:47.00]I only wanna see the light
[00:49.00]That shines behind your eyes
[00:56.00]I hope that I can say
[00:57.00]The things I wish I'd said
[01:00.00]To sing my soul to sleep
[01:02.00]And take me back to bed
[01:04.00]Who wants to be alone
[01:06.00]When we can feel alive instead
[01:17.00]Because we need each other
[01:21.00]We believe in one another
[01:25.00]And I know we're going to uncover
[01:29.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:34.00]Because we need each other
[01:38.00]We believe in one another
[01:42.00]I know we're going to uncover
[01:46.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:51.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[02:01.00]There are many things
[02:02.00]That I would like to know
[02:04.00]And there are many places
[02:06.00]That I wish to go
[02:09.00]But everything's depending
[02:10.00]On the way the wind may blow
[02:18.00]I don't know what it is
[02:20.00]That makes me feel alive
[02:22.00]I don't know how to wake
[02:24.00]The things that sleep inside
[02:26.00]I only wanna see the light
[02:28.00]That shines behind your eyes
[02:38.00]Because we need each other
[02:42.00]We believe in one another
[02:46.00]And I know we're going to uncover
[02:50.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[02:55.00]Because we need each other
[02:59.00]We believe in one another
[03:03.00]And I know we're going to uncover
[03:07.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:11.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:16.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:20.00]What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:24.00]Cos we believe
[03:28.00]Cos we believe
[03:32.00]Yeah we believe
[03:36.00]Cos we believe
[03:40.00]Cos we believe
[03:45.00]Cos we believe
[03:49.00]Because we need
[03:53.00]Because we need
[03:59.00]
[04:07.00]BEYOND再见理想
