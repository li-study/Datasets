[00:32.75]come all ye young fellas
[00:38.12]that handle a gun
[00:43.60]beware of night rambling
[00:48.95]by the setting of the sun
[00:54.32]and beware of an accident
[00:59.60]that happened of late
[01:05.12]to young molly ban
[01:10.46]and sad was her fate
[01:15.96]
[01:26.81]she was going to her uncles
[01:32.30]when a shower came on
[01:37.56]she went under a green bush
[01:43.15]the shower to shun
[01:47.81]
[01:51.47]her white apron wrapped around her
[01:56.58]he took her for a swan
[02:01.91]but a hush and sigh
[02:07.43]was his own molly ban
[02:12.66]
[02:26.39]he quickly ran to her
[02:31.75]and found she was dead
[02:37.24]and there on her bosom
[02:42.59]where he soaked, tears he shed
[02:47.54]
[02:48.53]he ran home to his father
[02:53.25]with his gun in his hand
[02:58.70]saying "father dear father
[03:04.02]i have shot molly ban"
[03:09.35]
[03:12.25]her white apron wrapped around her
[03:17.47]he took her for a swan
[03:22.63]but a hush and a sigh
[03:27.95]'twas his own molly ban
[03:33.54]
[03:44.24]he roamed near the place
[03:49.54]where his true love was slain
[03:54.94]he wept bitter tears
[04:00.23]but his cries were in vain
[04:05.75]as he look on the lake
[04:11.08]a swan glided by
[04:16.60]and the sun slowly sank
[04:21.96]in the gray up sky
[04:27.86]
