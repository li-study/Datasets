[00:22.00][01:35.00]Your heart is not open so I must go
[00:27.00][01:40.00]The spell has been broken... I loved you so
[00:34.00]Freedom comes when you learn to let go
[00:37.00]Creation comes when you learn to say no
[00:44.00][01:47.00]You were my lesson I had to learn
[00:50.00]I was your fortress you had to burn
[00:56.00]Pain is a warning that something's wrong
[00:59.00]I pray to God that it won't be long
[01:04.00]I wanna go higher
[01:07.00][03:11.00]There's nothing left to try
[01:13.00][03:16.00]There's no place left to hide
[01:18.00][03:22.00]There's no greater power than the power of good-bye
[01:52.00]I was your fortress
[01:58.00][03:34.00]There's nothing left to lose
[02:04.00][03:39.00]There's no more heart to bruise
[02:09.00][03:45.00]There's no greater power than the power of good-bye
[02:26.00]Learn to say good-bye
[02:37.00]I yearn to say good-bye
