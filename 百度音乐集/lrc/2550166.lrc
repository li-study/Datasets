[00:24.69]2
[00:25.69]1
[00:26.69]A loose door-jamb, light left on
[00:28.65]The oldest national lottery
[00:30.40]Enter johnny-go-darkly
[00:31.90]Come to spoil my party
[00:33.43]Smell of feces lingers
[00:35.04]Echo of light fingers
[00:36.76]Cold comfort blankets
[00:38.42]Steeped in creeping anger
[00:40.04]Flatfoot comes poking
[00:41.74]Compounding my misery
[00:43.46]Grinding pestle and mortar
[00:45.06]Adding insult to injury
[00:46.74]If only this, if only that,
[00:48.32]If only in my guts
[00:49.98]See my life before my eyes
[00:51.83]Trampled underfoot
[00:53.38](chorus)
[00:55.64]Creepy crawling
[00:56.72](repeat)
[01:06.44]All the creeps go creepy crawling
[01:09.83]Same thing every night
[01:12.83]How can stealing candy from a baby seem alright?
[01:21.56]What a wonderful world
[01:26.52]What a wonderful world
[01:32.53]Corvino, carrion crow
[01:35.44]Skulking with his mobile
[01:36.54]Slippery peat-bog eyes
[01:38.19]Stick-on smiley smile
[01:39.77]Small print like quicksand
[01:41.27]Not a wooden leg to stand on
[01:43.22]Sinking through my stomach
[01:44.72]The ground beneath me gone
[01:46.24]Free-fall, call ophelia
[01:47.97]Clutching at straw
[01:49.66]Mixed with bloody feathers
[01:51.32]From scruff of neck of crow
[01:52.87]Johnny go! johnny gone!
[01:54.66]Too much drink in your tum-tum-tum
[01:56.35]See this finger, see this thumb
[01:58.16]See this fist and watch it come
[01:59.48](chorus)
[02:12.63]All the creeps go creepy crawling
[02:16.09]Same thing every night
[02:19.21]How can stealing candy from a baby seem alright?
