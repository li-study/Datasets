[00:13.50]
[00:27.65]Come up to meet you
[00:30.71]Tell you I'm sorry
[00:33.80]You don't know how lovely you are
[00:40.54]I had to find you
[00:43.77]Tell you I need you
[00:46.99]Tell you I'll set you apart
[00:53.52]Tell me your secrets
[00:56.74]And ask me your questions
[01:00.07]Oh let's go back to the start
[01:06.56]Running in circles
[01:09.95]Coming in tails
[01:13.10]Heads are a science apart
[01:19.25]Nobody said it was easy
[01:25.85]It's such a shame for us to part
[01:32.23]Nobody said it was easy
[01:38.85]No one ever said it would be this hard
[01:47.91]Oh take me back to the start
[01:53.11]
[02:18.66]I was just guessing
[02:21.64]At numbers and figures
[02:24.90]Pulling the puzzles apart
[02:31.33]Questions of science
[02:34.65]Science and progress
[02:37.94]Could not speak as loud as my heart
[02:44.51]Tell me you love me
[02:47.51]Come back and haunt me
[02:51.00]Oh when I rush to the start
[02:57.47]Running in circles
[03:00.74]Coming in tails
[03:03.97]Coming back as we are
[03:10.34]Nobody said it was easy
[03:16.91]Oh it's such a shame for us to part
[03:23.23]Nobody said it was easy
[03:29.78]No one ever said it would be so hard
[03:38.82]I'm going back to the start.
[03:43.07]
[04:10.66]Oh...
[04:16.87]
[04:23.04]I...Oh...
[04:29.63]
[04:36.23]Oh...
[04:41.93]
[04:49.16]Oh...
