
[00:21.25]This time I need to know
[00:23.81]I really must be told
[00:28.04]If it's over
[00:31.50]It's up to you you know
[00:34.08]The things you want to hold
[00:38.31]Are in pieces
[00:41.37]Crashing down
[00:43.91]Crashing down again
[00:51.39]Crashing down
[00:53.88]Crashing down my freinds
[00:59.21]I've got to move it on
[01:01.76]I've got to sing my song
[01:05.92]While I still can
[01:09.68]Dispatch the last alarms
[01:12.12]Hand out the last few charms
[01:16.07]There's no surprises
[01:19.22]Only love
[01:21.77]Only love can win
[01:26.58]Crashing down
[01:29.10]Crashing down again
[01:34.13]Only love
[01:36.20]Yeah only love will win
[01:41.68]Crashing down
[01:44.18]Crashing down again
[02:09.79]This time I need to know
[02:12.31]I really must be told
[02:16.50]That it's over
[02:20.08]I've lived my life alone
[02:22.60]My every step foretold
[02:26.73]To never linger
[02:30.06]And yet it haunts me so
[02:32.62]What are we letting go
[02:36.80]Our spell is broken
[02:39.76]Crashing down
[02:42.23]Crashing down my friends
[02:47.08]Crashing down
[02:49.63]Crashing down again
[02:54.53]Only love
[02:56.36]Yeah only love will
[02:59.52]Be enough
[03:01.40]Yeah only love will win
[03:25.28]For every chemical
[03:27.58]You trade a piece of your soul
[03:31.68]With no return
[03:35.21]And who you think you know
[03:37.88]Doesn't know you at all
[03:41.65]Their drain is needless
[03:45.22]Someday we'll wave hello
[03:47.67]And wish we'd never waved goodbye
[03:51.78]To this romance
[03:55.18]We'll drink up every line
[03:57.66]And shoot up every word
[04:01.83]Till there's no more
[04:04.87]Crashing down
[04:07.35]Crashing down my friends
[04:12.39]Only love
[04:15.00]Only love can win
[04:19.73]So cry these tears we'll cry as all
[04:24.20]We've held so long to fall apart
[04:29.19]As the curtain falls we bid you all goodnight
