[00:16.95]Mommy used to say to me,
[00:20.70]Bein' you's the best you can be.
[00:24.54]And I make my mistakes,
[00:26.44]But I don't change my ways,
[00:27.89]Because I'm satisfied with me.
[00:30.63]And I don't trip when my friends they say to me,
[00:35.35]Damn you're mean.
[00:38.02]Just because I see them same as they but differently.
[00:43.82]
[00:43.99]Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
[00:47.86]That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
[00:51.69]Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
[00:55.67]That's just the way I see it.
[01:01.48]Oh oh oh oh&Acirc;….oh oh oh oh, come on.
[01:11.64]
[01:12.45]Two, three, four.
[01:15.62]Even if I really could change,
[01:19.28]I think people would find me strange.
[01:23.21]They think I'm buggin', maybe on somethin',
[01:26.65]Just because it wouldn't be me.
[01:29.15]So don't get mad cause we don't see the same,
[01:33.78]cause that's ok.
[01:35.77]You be you and I'll,
[01:39.21]I'll just concentrate on bein' me.
[01:42.46]
[01:42.66]Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
[01:46.61]That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
[01:50.36]Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
[01:54.35]That's just the way I see it.
[02:00.09]Oh oh oh oh&Acirc;….oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah&Acirc;…
[02:11.95]
[02:12.81]I won't apologize for bein' strong,
[02:17.71]Cause that ain't wrong.
[02:20.18]I don't know how to be any one else but me.
[02:26.60]
[02:26.81]Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
[02:30.29]That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
[02:33.88]Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
[02:38.28]That's just the way I see it.
