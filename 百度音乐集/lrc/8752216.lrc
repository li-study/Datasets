[00:09.20]Mary J Blige Lyrics - All That I Can Say
[00:12.55]
[00:15.82]Hmmm
[00:42.24]Loving you is wonderful
[00:44.79]Something like a miracle
[00:46.75]Rest assured I feel the same way you do
[00:51.83]Meeting you isn't hard
[00:55.00]With you I can't let down my guard
[00:56.92]Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
[01:01.05](Stay secure)
[01:02.99]I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
[01:04.57]This feeling that I know so well
[01:06.41]But I don't I don't
[01:12.03]1 All that I can say
[01:13.15](Do do do do do do doo)
[01:15.37]All that I can say
[01:17.80](Do do do do do do, doo)
[01:32.30]I've always been curious
[01:34.23]Meeting someone serious
[01:36.58]Looking for someone who loves like me
[01:41.81]But the day I stopped my search
[01:45.47]It seemed that you were put on this Earth
[01:46.81]To show me everything I could not see
[01:51.71]I wish I could find a way
[01:53.94]To tell you how I felt that day
[01:56.34]But I can't (I just can't)
[01:58.72]I can't
[01:59.42]
[02:22.02]Knowing him, loving him
[02:22.88]Hmmm, oh
[02:24.44]Showing him that I'm all him
[02:26.85]Living and forgiving and
[02:29.33]I would do it all again
[02:32.50]Genuine, servant
[02:34.40]Sweeter than cinamon
[02:37.02]Heaven-sent gentleman
[02:39.33]Sent him here for loving him
[02:41.55]Ooh, oh
[02:44.61]Ooh, oh
[03:01.80]He's all that I'll ever need
[03:02.90]He's got a hold on me
[03:03.45]I love you
[03:04.04]Oh I don't wanna live without you
[03:04.58]You're all that I can say, hey
[03:07.06]Loving you is wonderful
[03:07.69](Do do, do do, do do, doo)
[03:08.22]All that I can say
[03:08.66](Do do, do do, do do, doo)
[03:09.14]All that I can say
