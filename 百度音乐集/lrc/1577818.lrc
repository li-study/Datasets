[00:16.85]Please beware of them that stare
[00:18.92]They'll only smile to see you while
[00:21.33]Your time away
[00:26.25]And once you've seen what they have been
[00:28.18]To win the earth just won't seem worth
[00:30.75]Your night or your day
[00:35.15]Who'll hear what I say.
[00:40.65]Look around you find the ground
[00:42.42]Is not so far from where you are
[00:46.06]But not too wise
[00:49.86]For down below they never grow
[00:51.77]They're always tired and charms are hired
[00:55.28]From out of their eyes
[00:59.87]Never surprise.
[01:06.22]Take your time and you'll be fine
[01:08.33]And say a prayer for people there
[01:11.72]Who live on the floor
[01:15.42]And if you see what's meant to be
[01:17.26]Don't name the day or try to say
[01:21.08]It happened before.
[01:32.14]Don't be shy you learn to fly
[01:33.97]And see the sun when day is done
[01:37.11]If only you see
[01:40.93]Just what you are beneath a star
[01:43.10]That came to stay one rainy day
[01:46.47]In autumn for free
[01:49.88]Yes, be what you'll be.
[02:27.75]Please beware of them that stare
[02:29.77]They'll only smile to see you while
[02:32.10]Your time away
[02:36.95]And once you've seen what they have been
[02:38.76]To win the earth just won't seem worth
[02:41.49]Your night or your day
[02:45.80]Who'll hear what I say.
[02:53.57]Open up the broken cup
[02:55.57]Let goodly sin and sunshine in
[02:59.06]Yes that's today.
[03:02.54]And open wide the hymns you hide
[03:04.54]You find reknown while people frown
[03:08.28]At things that you say
[03:12.68]But say what you'll say
[03:17.55]About the farmers and the fun
[03:21.90]And the things behind the sun
[03:27.01]And the people round your head
[03:31.17]Who say everything's been said
[03:36.45]And the movement in your brain
[03:40.24]Sends you out into the rain.
