[00:02.23]STEEL BARS
[00:23.42]In the night I hear you speak
[00:26.02]Turn around, you're in my sleep
[00:33.43]Feel your hands inside my soul
[00:35.76]You're holding on and you won't let go
[00:42.10]I've tried running but there's no escape
[00:47.14]Can't bend them, and I just can't break these....
[00:51.43]Steel bars, wrapped all around me
[00:55.47]I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
[01:00.37]I'm bound forever, till the end of time
[01:04.81]Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine
[01:14.61]Trying hard to recognize
[01:17.21]See the face behind the eyes
[01:23.46]Feel your haunting ways like chains
[01:25.88]'Round my heart they still remain
[01:31.65]I'm still running, but there's nowhere to hide
[01:37.17]My love for you has got me locked up inside these……
[01:41.47]Steel bars, wrapped all around me
[01:45.39]I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
[01:50.58]I'm bound forever, till the end of time
[01:54.61]Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine
[02:02.19]And with every step I take
[02:03.71]Every desperate move I make
[02:05.98]It's clear to me
[02:08.46]What can all my living mean
[02:13.32]When time itself is so obscene
[02:15.65]When time itself don't mean a thing
[02:17.84]I'm still loving you
[02:20.17]Chorus
