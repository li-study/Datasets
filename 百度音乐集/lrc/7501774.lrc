[00:08.35]coming out of the dark
[00:09.01]Gloria Estefan
[00:16.77]why be afraid if i'm not alone
[00:24.38]though life is never easy the rest is unknown
[00:32.13]up to now for me it's been hands against stone
[00:39.41]spent each and every moment
[00:41.90]searching for what to believe
[00:45.73](chorus)
[00:45.99]coming out of the dark,i finally see the light now
[00:52.56]it's shining on me
[00:59.79]coming out of the dark,i know the love that saved me
[01:07.51]you're sharing with me
[01:27.75]starting again  is part of the plan
[01:35.53]and i'll be so much stronger holding your hand
[01:42.78]step by step i'll make it through i know i can
[01:50.19]it may not make it easier but i have felt you
[01:54.24]near all the way
[01:56.25](repeat chorus)
[01:56.57]coming out of the dark,i finally see the light now
[02:03.27]it's shining on me
[02:11.42]coming out of the dark,i know the love that saved me
[02:18.28]you're sharing with me
[02:22.33]forever,forever i stand on the rock of your love
[02:27.38]forever i'll stand on the rock
[02:36.00]forever,forever i stand on the rock of your love
[02:41.10]love is all it takes,no matter what we face
