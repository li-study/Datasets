[00:09.27]I've been waiting for something for so long
[00:15.58]To show me the answers that I want
[00:20.35]Reason to believe in that's so strong
[00:24.72]But I don't think that it exists
[00:26.74]
[00:27.24]I've been waiting for something for so long
[00:33.62]To show me the answers that I want
[00:38.37]Reason to believe in that's so strong
[00:42.69]But I don't think that it exists
[00:45.10]
[00:45.65]Yeah, give me reason to believe

[00:55.74]In every direction
[00:57.72]Yeah, can you give me what I need
[01:01.27]Or just sit and watch me bleed
[01:04.68]'Cause after all

[01:28.32]Everybody's got a secret
[01:31.74]Can you tell me what is mine?
[01:38.29]Can you tell me what you'd find
[01:41.77]I'll tell you if you keep it
[01:45.02]I promise not to lie
[01:48.66]
[01:57.90]Well, I have the fears
[02:01.52]The pain and the tears
[02:04.28]I just can't hide
[02:11.43]It all disappears
[02:14.68]'Cause everything passes with the time
[02:21.70]All you need is reason to believe
[02:28.01]
