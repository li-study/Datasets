[00:01.00]Everclear - Wonderful
[00:03.00]
[00:08.93]I close my eyes when I get too sad
[00:12.53]I think thoughts that I know are bad
[00:14.69]Close my eyes and I count to ten
[00:17.12]Hope it's over when I open them
[00:19.93]I want the things that I had before
[00:22.16]Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
[00:24.70]I wish I could count to ten
[00:27.21]Make everything be wonderful again
[00:30.13]Hope my mom and I hope my dad
[00:32.16]Will figure out why they get so mad
[00:34.72]Hear them scream, I hear them fight
[00:37.14]They say bad words that make me wanna cry
[00:40.02]Close my eyes when I go to bed
[00:42.12]And I dream of angels who make me smile
[00:44.72]I feel better when I hear them say
[01:34.50][00:47.05]Everything will be wonderful someday
[00:50.40]Promises mean everything when you're little and the world's so big
[01:43.89][00:56.45]I just don't understand how
[01:46.88][01:00.14]You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
[01:04.00]Tell me everything is wonderful now
[02:52.42][01:13.58]Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
[01:17.38]I go to school and I run and play
[01:19.71]I tell the kids that it's all okay
[01:22.25]I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
[01:24.69]When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home
[01:27.56]Go to my room and I close my eyes
[01:29.52]I make believe that I have a new life
[01:32.02]I don't believe you when you say
[01:37.52]Promises mean everything when you're little and the world is so big
[01:50.51]When you tell me everything is wonderful now
[02:05.00][01:55.72]No
[02:07.91][01:58.05]No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
[02:24.63][02:14.53]I don't wanna hear you say
[02:16.81]That I will understand someday
[02:29.20][02:19.42]No, no, no, no
[02:26.82]You both have grown in a different way
[02:34.63]I don't wanna meet your friends
[02:36.60]And I don't wanna start over again
[02:39.15]I just want my life to be the same, just like it used to be
[02:44.75]Some days I hate everything
[02:47.85]I hate everything
[02:49.90]Everyone and everything
[03:00.56]I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
