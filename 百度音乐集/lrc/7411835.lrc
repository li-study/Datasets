[00:01.87]歌名：And I Love You So - 我是如此爱你
[00:02.38]歌手：Perry Como
[00:13.38]And I love you so
[00:18.81]The people ask me how
[00:24.58]How I live till now
[00:30.14]I tell them I don't know
[00:35.81]I guess they understand
[00:40.59]How lonely life has been
[00:45.68]But life began again
[00:50.96]The day you took my hand
[00:57.54]And yes I know how lonely life can be
[01:08.02]The shadows follow me
[01:13.30]And the night won't set me free
[01:18.26]But I don't let the evening get me down
[01:29.17]Now that you're around me
[01:40.85]And you love me too
[01:46.07]Your thoughts are just for me
[01:51.03]You set my spirit free
[01:56.46]I'm happy that you do
[02:01.53]The book of life is brief
[02:06.75]And once a page is read
[02:11.95]All but love is dead
[02:17.57]That is my belief
[02:23.30]And yes I know how lonely life can be
[02:33.75]The shadows follow me
[02:38.93]And the night won't set me free
[02:44.04]But I don't let the evening get me down
[02:54.69]Now that you're around me
