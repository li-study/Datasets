[01:03.90]In a time of loneliness
[01:08.66]Years gone by
[01:11.22]Time of sadness
[01:13.36]Tried to survive
[01:21.25]We saw a land so glorious
[01:24.17]Far beyond the sun
[01:27.01]Let us ride away, and we're
[01:32.79]Touching ths sky tonight
[01:35.72]Dreams have fallen, voices calling
[01:39.50]And together we will spread our wings and fly
[01:43.77]darkness falling, heroes calling
[01:48.46]Forever for the love - forever for the flame inside
[01:53.01]Hope has fallen, winds are calling
[01:57.98]Once upon a time the world was in distress
[02:02.43]But now we live in peace united - till the end
[02:08.21]Forever in a land of grace and glory
[02:12.25]My soul is free of pain
[02:14.08]And the children tell us stories
[02:17.50]That harmony remains
[02:19.87]Forever in a land of grace and glory
[02:23.30]My heart will live again
[02:25.68]And the children tell us stories
[02:28.87]That happiness remains
[02:32.24]Watching the sky, the light
[02:35.23]Stranger's walking, creatures talking
[02:40.13]And return to the sun, escape from the night
[02:43.96]Darkness falling, shadows crawling
[02:48.82]Oh you pray to you're god and you pray for eternal life
[02:52.94]Times are turning, planets burning
[02:59.06]Once upon a time the world was in distress
[03:03.42]But now we live in peace united - till the end
[03:08.83]Forever in a land of grace and glory
[03:12.39]My soul is free of pain
[03:14.82]And the children tell us stories
[03:18.10]That harmony remains
[03:20.45]Forever in a land of grace and glory
[03:24.51]My heart will live again
[03:26.48]And the children tell us stories
[03:29.85]That happiness remains
