[00:00.00]Green Day - Viva La Gloria? (Little Girl)
[00:29.54]Little girl, little girl
[00:31.46]Why are you crying?
[00:34.61]Inside your restless soul your heart is dying
[00:39.53]Little one, little one
[00:41.44]Your soul is purging
[00:44.72]Of love and razor blades
[00:46.58]Your blood is surging
[00:49.18]Runaway
[00:51.95]From the river to the street
[00:54.73]And find yourself with your face in the gutter
[00:59.45]Your a stray for the salvation army
[01:04.73]There is no place like home
[01:08.30]When you got no place to go
[01:14.52]Little girl, little girl
[01:16.36]Your life is calling
[01:19.64]The charlatans and saints of your abandon
[01:24.55]Little one little one
[01:26.51]The sky is falling
[01:29.71]The lifeboat of deception is now sailing
[01:34.83]In the wake all the way
[01:36.87]No rhyme or reason
[01:39.78]Your bloodshot eyes
[01:40.78]Will show your heart of treason
[01:44.87]Little girl little girl
[01:46.74]You dirty liar
[01:50.29]Your just a junkie
[01:51.65]Preaching to the choir
[01:55.06]Runaway
[01:57.39]From the river to the street
[02:00.21]And find yourself with your face in the gutter
[02:05.09]Your a stray for the salvation army
[02:10.19]There is no place like home
[02:14.45]When you got no place to go
[02:20.68]The traces of blood
[02:22.66]Always follow you home
[02:24.89]Like the Mascara tears
[02:27.41]From your getaway
[02:30.30]Your walking with blisters
[02:32.69]And running with shears
[02:35.08]So unholy.
[02:39.67]Sister of grace.
[03:20.00]Runaway
[03:22.27]From the river to the street
[03:25.02]And find yourself with your face in the gutter
[03:29.75]You`re a stray for the salvation army
[03:35.03]There is no place like home
