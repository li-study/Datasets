[00:01.81]Clocks
[00:02.64]Coldplay
[00:03.65]
[00:29.71]Lights go out and I can't be saved
[00:32.96]Tides that I tried to swim against
[00:36.57]Put me down upon my knees
[00:40.43]Oh I beg, I beg and plead
[00:44.04]Singing come out of things unsaid
[00:47.58]Shoot an apple off my head
[00:51.01]And trouble that can't be named
[00:54.79]Tigers waiting to be tamed
[00:58.49]Singing you are...
[01:07.35]You are...
[01:13.14]
[01:28.23]Confusion that never stops
[01:32.05]Closing walls and ticking clocks
[01:35.60]Gonna come back and take you home
[01:39.26]I could not stop but you now know
[01:42.52]Singing come out upon my seas
[01:46.67]Curse missed opportunities
[01:50.21]Am I a part of the cure
[01:53.86]Or am I part of the disease
[01:57.25]Singing you are...
[02:06.40]You are...
[02:13.59]You are...
[02:21.16]You are...
[02:26.67]
[02:43.06]You are...
[02:50.36]You are...
[02:57.92]And nothing else compares...
[03:03.08]
[03:04.91]And nothing else compares...
[03:11.74]And nothing else compares...
[03:22.97]
[03:56.24]You are...
[04:03.57]You are...
[04:09.07]
[04:09.70]Home, home where I wanted to go...
