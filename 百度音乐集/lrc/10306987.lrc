[00:00.00]Vanessa Carlton - Ordinary Day
[00:00.26]
[03:33.56][00:01.26]Just a day,
[03:34.64][00:02.18]Just an ordinary day.
[03:37.22][00:05.03]Just tryin' to get by.
[03:41.12][00:08.85]Just a boy,
[03:42.12][00:09.85]Just an ordinary boy.
[03:44.50][00:12.14]But he was looking to the sky.
[00:15.82]And as he asked if I would come along
[00:20.82]I started to realize
[00:24.23]That everyday he finds
[00:25.95]Just what he's looking for,
[00:28.13]Like a shooting star he shines.
[00:31.15]He said take my hand,
[00:35.88]Live while you can
[00:39.76]Don't you see all you dreams are
[00:42.64]Right in the palm of your hand
[00:48.55]
[00:55.48]And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
[00:58.57]Although they did not feel, no
[01:02.86]For I felt what I had not felt before
[01:06.69]You'd swear those words could heal.
[01:10.05]And as I looked up into those eyes
[01:14.66]His vision borrows mine.
[01:18.43]And to know he's no stranger,
[01:20.90]For I feel I've held him for all of time.
[02:53.55][01:24.71]And he said take my hand,
[02:58.77][01:29.94]Live while you can
[03:01.76][01:32.86]Don't you see all your dreams are
[03:05.44][01:36.44]Right in the palm of your hand,
[03:13.60][03:09.71][01:40.64]In the palm of your hand,
[03:20.09][01:47.09]
[02:00.62]Please come with me,
[02:04.38]See what I see.
[02:08.18]Touch the stars for time will not flee.
[02:15.90]Time will not flee.
[02:19.70]Can you see
[02:23.22]
[02:24.03]Just a dream, just an ordinary dream.
[02:27.50]As I wake in bed
[02:31.72]And the boy, that ordinary boy.
[02:34.98]Or was it all in my head?
[02:38.98]Did he asked if I would come along
[02:43.62]It all seemed so real.
[02:47.16]But as I looked to the door,
[02:49.14]I saw that boy standing there with a deal.
[03:51.63]
