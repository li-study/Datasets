[00:00.65]'So we meet again!' and I offer my hand
[00:04.81]All dry and English slow
[00:07.73]And you look at me and I understand
[00:11.38]Yeah it's the look I used to know
[00:15.51]'Three long years and your favourite man
[00:18.58]Is that any way to say hello?'
[00:22.30]And you hold me
[00:27.83]Like you'll never let me go
[00:34.09]Like you'll never let me go
[00:38.41]
[00:43.40]'Oh c'mon and have a drink with me
[00:47.03]Sit down and talk awhile'
[00:50.41]'Oh I wish I could.and I will!
[00:53.63]But now I just don't have the time'
[00:58.03]And over my shoulder as I walk away
[01:01.53]I see you give that look goodbye.
[01:06.51]I still see that look in your eyes
[01:11.17]
[01:12.03]So dizzy Mr Busy - too much rush to talk to Billy
[01:15.62]All the silly frilly things have to first get done
[01:18.82]In a minute - Sometime soon - Maybe next time - Make it June
[01:22.76]Until later doesn't always come.
[01:26.45]
[01:54.57]It's so hard to think it ends sometime
[01:58.59]And this could be the last
[02:01.48]I should really hear you sing again
[02:05.14]And I should really watch you dance
[02:08.58]Because it's hard to think
[02:10.92]I'll never get another chance to hold you.
[02:16.11]To hold you
[02:17.95]
[02:23.34]But chilly Mr. Dilly - too much rush to talk to Billy
[02:26.87]All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done
[02:30.22]In a second - just hang on - all in good time - won't be long
[02:34.03]Until later.
[02:36.30]
[02:37.62]I should've stopped to think - I should've made the time
[02:44.15]I could've had that drink - I could've talked a while
[02:51.77]I would've done it right - I would've moved us on
[02:58.53]But I didn't - now it's all too late it's over. over
[03:04.24]And you're gone.
[03:09.22]
[03:20.70]I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you
[03:24.81]I miss you I miss you so much.
[03:26.58]
[03:34.64]But how many times can I walk away
[03:37.87]And wish if only.
[03:41.25]How many times can I talk this way
[03:44.78]And wish if only.
[03:47.83]
[03:48.94]Keep on making the same mistake
[03:52.37]Keep on aching the same heartbreak
[03:55.57]I wish if only.
[03:59.03]But if only
[04:01.65]Is a wish too late
