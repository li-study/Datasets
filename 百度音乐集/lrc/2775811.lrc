[00:13]There's a nail in the door
[00:15]And there's glass on the lawn
[00:18]Tacks on the floor
[00:19]And the TV is on
[00:22]And I always sleep with my guns
[00:26]When you're gone
[00:28]
[00:30]There's a blade by the bed
[00:32]And a phone in my hand
[00:35]A dog on the floor
[00:36]And some cash on the nightstand
[00:39]When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
[00:43]And I just can't stand
[00:45]
[00:47]What should I do I'm just a little baby
[00:52]What if the lights go out and maybe
[00:56]And then the wind just starts to moan
[01:00]Outside the door he followed me home
[01:04]Well goodnight moon
[01:05]I want the sun
[01:08]If it's not here soon
[01:10]I might be done
[01:12]No it won't be too soon 'til I say
[01:17]Goodnight moon
[01:19]
[01:23]There's a shark in the pool
[01:25]And a witch in the tree
[01:27]A crazy old neighbour and he's been watching me
[01:32]And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
[01:38]
[01:41]Something's under the bed
[01:43]Now it's out in the hedge
[01:45]There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
[01:50]And I hear something scratching through the wall
[01:56]
[01:58]Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
[02:02]What if the lights go out and maybe
[02:07]I just hate to be all alone
[02:10]Outside the door he followed me home
[02:15]Now goodnight moon
[02:17]I want the sun
[02:19]If it's not here soon
[02:21]I might be done
[02:23]No it won't be too soon 'til I say
[02:28]Goodnight moon
[02:30]
[02:49]Well you're up so high
[02:51]How can you save me
[02:53]When the dark comes here
[02:55]Tonight to take me up
[02:57]The mouth from woke
[02:59]And into bed where it kisses my face
[03:04]And eats my hand
[03:05]Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
[03:10]What if the lights go out and maybe
[03:14]And then the wind just starts to moan
[03:18]Outside the door he followed me home
[03:22]Now goodnight moon
[03:25]I want the sun
[03:26]If it's not here soon
[03:29]I might be done
[03:31]No it won't be too soon 'til I say
[03:35]Goodnight moon
[03:37]
[03:40]No it won't be too soon 'til I say
[03:44]Goodnight moon
[03:47]
