[00:00.00]Red Zone - Labyrinth
[00:35.98]By SayNo
[00:36.81]
[00:38.51]I've walked in the street of yesterday
[00:48.30]I've walked with your eyes
[00:53.02]as blue as the sky
[00:57.20]
[00:57.76]And we learned the hard way
[01:06.74]we wanted to live forever
[01:11.74]everyone together
[01:16.53]
[01:17.18]walking to red zone
[01:21.96]through the silence of night
[01:26.68]I've looked at the city of yesterday
[01:35.22]
[01:36.09]And we've paid with our lives
[01:45.53]we wanted to live forever
[01:50.66]everyway together
[02:46.57]I've broken everything we've made ...
[02:55.18]
[02:56.30]... we wanted to live forever
[03:00.82]everyway together
