[00:12.87]Looking out a dirty old window
[00:16.10]Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
[00:22.55]I sit here alone and I wonder why
[00:29.57]Friday night and everyone’’s moving
[00:32.96]I can feel the heat but it’’s moving
[00:39.07]I search for the beat in this dirty town
[00:43.42]Downtown the young ones are going
[00:46.13]Downtown the young ones are growing
[00:49.96]We’re the kids in America
[00:52.28]We’re the kids in America
[00:56.15]Everybody live for the music-go-round
[01:03.08]Bright lights, the music gets faster
[01:06.05]Look boy, don’t check on your watch
[01:09.54]Not another glance
[01:11.94]I’m not leaving now, honey
[01:15.90]Not a chance
[01:19.36]Hot-shot, give me no problems
[01:22.61]Much later baby you’’ll be saying never mind
[01:28.56]You know life is cruel

[01:35.30]Kind hearts don’t grab any glory
[01:39.38]We’re the kids in America
[01:42.23]We’re the kids in America
[01:45.75]Everybody live for the music-go-round
[02:05.80]Come closer honey, that’s better
[02:08.86]Got to get a brand new experience
[02:12.12]Feeling right
[02:15.02]Oh don’t try to stop baby
[02:18.51]Hold me tight
[02:22.24]Outside a new day is dawning
[02:25.44]Outside Suburbia’s sprawling everywhere
[02:31.26]I don’t want to go baby
[02:35.56]New York to East California
[02:38.92]There’s a new wave coming, I warn you
[02:42.15]We’re the kids in America
[02:45.25]We’re the kids in America
[02:48.70]Everybody live for the music-go-round
[02:55.62]We’re the kids in America

[03:02.01]Everybody live for the music-go-rou
