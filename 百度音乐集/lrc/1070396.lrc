[00:09.18]Artist:Keane
[00:14.28]Album:Hopes and Fears
[00:19.26][00:27.34]by Johnyellow      I love Britpop
[00:28.42]You think your days are uneventful
[00:34.90]And no one ever thinks about you
[00:41.48]She goes her own way
[00:48.47]She goes her own way
[00:55.15]You think your days are ordinary
[01:01.14]And no one ever thinks about you
[01:08.44]But we're all the same
[01:15.31]And she can hardly breathe without you
[01:19.90]She says she has no time
[01:30.28]For you now
[01:33.46]She says she has no time
[01:49.34]Well Think about the lonely people
[01:55.92]Or think about the day she found you
[02:02.40]Or lie to yourself
[02:09.09]And see it all dissolve around you
[02:14.07]She says she has no time
[02:24.56]For you now
[02:27.35]She says she has no time
[02:38.03]For you now
[02:40.91]She says she has no time
[03:22.12]Lonely people tumble downwards
[03:35.49]My heart opens up to you
[03:47.46]When she says
[03:50.76]She has no time
[03:58.65]For you now
[04:01.93]She says she has no time
[04:12.71]For you now
[04:15.60]She says she has no time
