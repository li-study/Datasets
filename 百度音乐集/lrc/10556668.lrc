[00:02.00]Silverstein - The End (Feat. Lights)
[00:07.00]
[00:18.23]First time we met
[00:23.44]Face became etched
[00:29.00]In my mind
[00:33.62]
[00:37.55]You were the sun
[00:45.69]I was the one who worshipped you
[00:52.25]My hands were your guns
[00:59.32]Your eyes were my muse
[01:03.12]
[01:03.91]And I knew you could never love me
[01:10.72]I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach
[01:19.32]But can I still keep
[01:25.84]A place in your heart
[01:31.57]
[01:33.54]You broke my heart
[01:40.02]You promised me the moon and stars
[01:46.41]I fell for your dreams
[01:50.60]I fell for your lies
[01:53.61]There was no other way
[01:57.21]You know I tried
[01:59.83]
[02:00.65]And I knew you could never love me
[02:07.52]I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach
[02:16.50]But can I still keep
[02:22.89]A place in your heart
[02:28.71]
[02:41.55]There is something
[02:47.56]I want you to know
[02:54.90]I think you know exactly what it is
[03:05.54]
[03:08.57]I didn't want to save you
[03:16.03]I didn't want to save you
[03:22.83]I set our house on fire
[03:28.10]To watch it burn
[03:32.90]But I couldn't just leave you
[03:36.57]
[03:37.32]And I knew you could never love me
[03:43.05]I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach
[03:51.40]But I'll ask you this
[03:58.26]Will you still miss me?
[04:02.61](I still miss you)
[04:03.88]Will you love me?
[04:05.69](Yes, I love you)
[04:07.20]
[04:08.11]Lights fill the sky
[04:14.28]We'll both die tonight
[04:18.12]We'll both die tonight
[04:21.91]Lights from the sky
[04:27.95]What if the white light flies
[04:31.54]As we follow the light
[04:36.10]
[05:01.66]Lights fill the sky
[05:09.28]We'll both die tonight
[05:12.74]We'll both die tonight
[05:16.90]Lights from the sky
[05:22.86]What if the white light flies
[05:26.32]As we follow the light
[05:30.19]
[05:30.86]We'll both die tonight
[05:33.34]We'll both die tonight
[05:39.68]
[05:40.82]What if the white light flies
[05:47.04]We'll both die tonight
[05:50.56]As we follow the light
[05:56.91]
