[00:00.00]Slow Hand
[00:06.29]Pointer Sisters
[00:08.91]
[00:13.91]As the midnight moon, was drifting through
[00:22.44]The lazy sway of the trees
[00:26.20]I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
[00:30.98]Seeing what you wanted to see
[00:34.46]Darlin' don't say a word, cause I already heard
[00:39.56]What your body's sayin' to mine
[00:43.61]I'm tired of fast moves
[00:45.91]I've got a slow groove...
[00:49.55]On my mind
[00:52.13]
[00:53.42]I want a man with a slow hand
[00:57.64]I want a lover with an easy touch
[01:01.92]I want somebody who will spend some time
[01:05.57]Not come and go in a heated rush
[01:10.05]I want somebody who will understand
[01:14.80]When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
[01:20.98]
[01:28.70]On shadowed ground, with no one around
[01:41.95]And a blanket of stars in our eyes
[01:46.53]We are drifting free, like two lost leaves
[01:50.75]On the crazy wind of the night
[01:54.29]Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
[01:59.32]What your body's sayin' to mine
[02:03.22]If I want it all night
[02:05.64]You say it's alright
[02:08.25]We got the time
[02:13.18]
[02:13.48]'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
[02:17.58]I got a lover with an easy touch
[02:21.88]I found somebody who will spend some time
[02:26.13]Not come and go in a heated rush
[02:30.46]I found somebody who will understand
[02:34.78]When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
[02:40.21]
[02:44.67]If I want it all night
[02:48.43]Please say it's alright
[02:53.21]It's not a fast move
[02:55.98]But a slow groove
[02:58.60]On my mind
[03:02.34]
[03:02.83]'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
[03:07.06]I got a lover with an easy touch
[03:11.35]I found somebody who will spend some time
[03:15.07]Not come and go in a heated rush
[03:19.95]I found somebody who will understand
[03:23.80]When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
