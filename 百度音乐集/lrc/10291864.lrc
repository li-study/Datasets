[00:02.84]What It Takes
[00:09.21]
[00:15.55]There goes my old girlfriend
[00:18.64]There's another diamond ring
[00:21.85]And, uh, all those late night promises
[00:25.07]I guess they don't mean a thing
[00:28.51]So baby, what's the story?
[00:31.83]Did you find another man?
[00:34.86]Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
[00:38.69]When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away
[00:45.80]I used feel your fire
[00:48.33]But now it's cold inside
[00:52.15]And you're back on the street
[00:53.65]Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
[00:56.64]Tell me what it takes to let you go
[01:03.14]Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
[01:09.89]Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
[01:15.44]Without thinkin' you lost everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
[01:23.50]Tell me what it takes to let you go
[01:27.49]Yeah
[01:29.59]Girl, before I met you I was F-I-N-E fine
[01:35.54]But your love made me a prisoner
[01:38.49]Yeah, my heart's been doin' time
[01:42.99]You spent me up like money
[01:45.53]And then you hung me out to dry
[01:49.12]It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
[01:52.65]'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes
[01:56.86]Tell me what it takes to let you go
[02:04.01]Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
[02:10.72]Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
[02:15.97]Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life to the toss of  the dice?
[02:23.97]Tell what it takes to let you go
[02:29.35]Guitar!
[02:36.47]
[02:54.30]Tell that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
[03:01.05]Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
[03:07.90]Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
[03:11.01]Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
[03:13.77]Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me
[03:21.12]Tell me what it takes to let you go
[03:28.03]Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
[03:33.96]Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
[03:39.95]Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
[03:49.65]Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice
[03:53.81]No, no, no, no 'cause I don't wanna burn in paradise
[04:06.78]Ooo, let go, let go, let go, I don't wanna burn in paradise
[04:12.71]Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
[04:18.36]Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
[04:20.88]I don't wanna burn, I don't wanna burn
