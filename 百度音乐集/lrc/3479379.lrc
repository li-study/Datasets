[00:02.84]Eye To Eye
[00:06.13]Amy Grant
[00:21.26]Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand
[00:24.87]Before darkness falls
[00:31.44]And I'd like to figure out
[00:33.69]Before too late
[00:35.54]Before hope is lost
[00:41.80]Cause the sun that's shining on my face
[00:44.64]Is shining down on you
[00:46.94]And the fruit that gives me strength to live
[00:49.78]Is giving you strength too
[00:52.26]Can we find a way to find a compromise
[00:56.13]Tho' we don't see eye to eye
[01:02.89]Eye to eye
[01:07.95]Well, I'd like to figure out a way
[01:11.64]To leave a troubled past behind
[01:18.38]To forget those angry words and wars we fought
[01:22.23]Across the battle lines
[01:28.82]Cause tomorrow we could find a road to peace
[01:31.96]For you and me
[01:33.93]And our children in their innocence
[01:36.50]Will follow what they see
[01:39.16]Oh, we've got to find a way to live our lives
[01:41.45]Tho' we don't see eye to eye
[01:49.76]Oh...how easy it would be
[01:55.17]To close the door and walk away
[02:00.57]I can't walk out when I believe
[02:05.58]You are my brother
[02:05.61]And we owe it to each other
[02:09.14]Tho' we don't see eye to eye
[02:09.39]We've got to try
[02:15.48]Eye to eye
[02:42.02]Oh...how easy it would be
[02:47.43]To close the door and walk away
[02:52.46]I can't walk out when I believe
[02:57.62]You are my brother
[02:58.80]And we owe it to each other
[03:00.84]We've got to try
[03:02.41]Tho' we don't see eye to eye
[03:07.27]Eye to eye
[03:17.62]Eye to eye

[03:23.87]Well, I'd like to find a way
[03:25.87]Tho' we don't see eye to eye
[03:33.43]Eye to eye
[03:44.51]Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand
[03:48.52]Before darkness falls...
