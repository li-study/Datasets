[00:09.00][02:29.55] [03:33.93]　
[00:13.91]If ever I would leave you
[00:19.17]It wouldn't be in summer
[00:24.18]Seeing you in summer
[00:27.31]I never would go
[00:33.43]Your hair streaked with sun-light
[00:38.59]Your lips red as flame
[00:43.30]Your face with a lustre
[00:48.15]that puts gold to shame
[00:53.31]But if I'd ever leave you
[00:58.18]It couldn't be in autumn
[01:03.08]How I'd leave in autumn
[01:06.08]I never will know
[01:11.99]I've seen how you sparkle
[01:16.84]When fall nips the air
[01:21.75]I know you in autumn
[01:26.41]And I must be there
[01:32.08]And could I leave you
[01:34.56]running merrily through the snow
[01:40.96]Or on a wintry evening
[01:44.14]when you catch the fire's glow
[01:49.25][02:47.21]If ever I would leave you
[01:53.95][02:52.13]How could it be in spring-time
[01:58.64][02:56.84]Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
[02:07.03][03:05.41]Oh no not in spring-time
[02:11.58][03:10.13]Summer winter or fall
[02:16.74][03:15.40]No never could I leave you
[02:23.10][03:21.99]at all
