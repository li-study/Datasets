[00:18.10]I have often dreamed
[00:22.00]Of a far-off place
[00:25.85]Where a hero's welcome
[00:29.68]Would be waiting for me
[00:34.39]Where the crowds will cheer
[00:38.85]When they see my face
[00:42.48]And a voice keeps saying
[00:45.02]This is where I'm meant to be
[00:49.28]I'll be there someday
[00:54.12]I can go the distance
[00:57.42]I'll find my way
[01:01.30]If I can be strong
[01:05.74]I know every mile
[01:15.74]When I go the distance
[01:18.66]I'll be right where I belong
[01:27.50]
[01:30.16]Down an unknown road
[01:34.29]You embrace my fate
[01:38.06]Though that road may wander
[01:41.90]It will lead me to you
[01:45.97]And a thousand years
[01:49.00]Would be worth the wait
[01:53.27]It might take a life time
[01:56.78]But somehow I'll see it through
[02:00.75]And I won't look back
[02:04.84]I can go the distance
[02:08.52]And I'll stay on track
[02:12.44]No I won't accept defeat
[02:15.78]It's an uphill slope
[02:19.64]But I won't lose hope
[02:23.61]Till I go the distance
[02:27.22]And my journey is complete~~~~~~~~~
[02:38.75]But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
[02:45.71]For a hero's strength is measured by his heart
[02:54.60]#$%^*
[03:17.55]Like a shooting star
[03:21.06]I will go the distance
[03:24.52]I will search the world
[03:28.78]I will face its harms
[03:32.60]I don't care how far
[03:36.26]I can go the distance
[03:40.12]Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
[03:55.77]
[04:05.09]I will search the world
[04:09.35]I will face its harms
[04:13.82]Till i find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
