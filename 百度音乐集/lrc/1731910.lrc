[01:05.27]Hear me, speaking
[01:09.35]Asking why I even bother
[01:13.51]Tell me, how you
[01:17.70]Live from day to day
[01:21.12]
[01:22.96]Take your time and look around
[01:31.22]Is this utopia you've found
[01:36.01]
[01:56.34]Sick of all of this
[01:59.34]The suffering and we just carry on
[02:04.68]Isn't it time we care and lose the hate
[02:09.86]Understand our fears
[02:12.21]
[02:13.53]But we do all that we can
[02:21.38]Justify the means to an end
[02:29.35]Sorry you must excuse me
[02:32.83]I've painted my own Mona Lisa
[02:37.01]She's fixed everything
[02:40.45]Now I'm spoiled beyond my wildest dreams
[02:45.39]
[02:45.82]Blind Faith we have in you
[02:50.91]Invisible
[02:52.38]Which direction do we choose
[02:57.23]Predictable
[02:58.89]
[03:16.40]Take the streets, the beaten path
[03:20.15]Our system works for whom I ask
[03:24.24]Yeah I have it all
[03:26.24]The bigger house
[03:28.52]An iron fence to keep you out
[03:32.30]
[03:33.82]When did we all let you down
[03:41.96]So come Messiah show us how how
[03:50.25]Our human spirit drowns
[03:54.06]Don't think you hear me now
[03:57.71]No sign of you around
[04:02.15]What is it you hope to see
[04:06.09]
[04:06.58]Blind Faith we have in you
[04:11.47]Invisible
[04:13.13]Which direction do we choose
[04:18.14]Predictable
[04:19.66]Give us something we can use
[04:24.48]Desirable
[04:26.13]'cause you've done all you can do
[04:30.90]Regrettable
[04:33.27]
[04:35.17]And still life pushes on
[04:38.70]With or without you
[04:42.12]We've got to carry on
[04:45.47]Our will, will guide us to
[04:49.12]A place where we belong
[04:52.62]Know there lies the truth
[04:56.06]I am the believer who gives purpose on to you
[05:01.75]
[08:24.08]I don't think we let you down
[08:31.74]So come Messiah show us how how
[08:39.71]Throw us a pure lifeline
[08:43.49]I hope that you hear me
[08:46.43]Too proud to be around
[08:50.93]There's more to us than we see now
[08:55.03]
[08:55.52]Blind Faith we have in you
[09:00.26]Invisible
[09:02.08]Which direction do we choose
[09:07.05]Predictable
[09:08.54]Self ignorance, abuse
[09:13.29]Desirable
[09:14.89]'cause you've done all you can do
[09:19.85]Incredible
