[00:45.39]He stands alone outside the blooming yards
[00:49.68]All is calm there on the street
[00:55.40]The shadows pass him hung right over
[01:00.77]The pain on his face he knew he'd keep...
[01:06.83]His hair is long, and it's twisted, it's twisted
[01:11.85]Around the smile spread cheek to cheek
[01:17.25]Another child, another soul, grabs a hold
[01:22.32]To the metal that will end his misery...

[01:28.51]One by one
[01:30.61]We stand beneath the sun
[01:34.41]With arms high open wide
[01:38.85]Two by two
[01:41.15]He's getting you
[01:43.89]To watch him as he leaves this life he knew
[01:50.68]
[01:55.80]How much anger is set aside
[02:01.16]As each one of us cries
[02:06.71]Red light they come and they take him away
[02:11.84]In the thoughts, he'll be better, some day...
[02:17.52]Tied tight, can't see out your eyes
[02:20.10]That he's sure to shine, sure to shine
[02:23.05]In this deep dark, fucked up, played out, reality show
[02:28.31]So, who's the man, with the plan,
[02:31.98]eating up all that he can?
[02:34.54]Don't you see, don't you see...
[02:39.81]One by one
[02:41.62]We stand beneath the sun
[02:46.04]With arms high open wide
[02:50.42]Two by two

[03:26.98]Do you ever think that things are meant to be?
[03:31.40]I know we all have our reasons why
[03:38.57]And now the power of one human being
[03:43.46]Has gone and changed so many lives...
[03:48.97]One by one
[03:51.22]We stand beneath the sun
[03:54.53]With arms high open wide
[03:59.31]Two by two
[04:01.94]He's getting you
[04:04.83]To watch him as he leaves this life he kne
[04:10.48]One by one
[04:12.94]We start to come undone...
[04:21.31]Two by two
[04:24.75]He's getting through to you...
[04:32.41]One by one we stand, we stand, we stand,
[04:48.33]over, over, you...
