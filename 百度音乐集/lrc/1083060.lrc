
[00:21.00]Angel came down from heaven yesterday
[00:27.00]She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
[00:34.00]And she told me a story yesterday
[00:41.00]About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
[00:48.00]And then she spread her wings high over me
[00:54.00]She said she's going to come back tomorrow
[01:05.00]An' I said fly on, my sweet angel
[01:13.00]Fly on through the sky
[01:20.00]Fly on, my sweet angel
[01:26.00]Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side
[01:32.00]
[01:59.00]Sure enough, this morning came on to me
[02:05.00]Silver-winged silhouette against a child's sunrise
[02:13.00]And my angel, she said unto me
[02:20.00]"Today is the day for you to rise
[02:27.00]Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
[02:29.00]You're gonna rise"
[02:33.00]And then she took me high over yonder, Lord
[02:43.00]An' I said fly on, my sweet angel
[02:50.00]Fly on through the sky
[02:58.00]Fly on, my sweet angel
[03:05.00]Forever I will be by your side
[03:08.00]
