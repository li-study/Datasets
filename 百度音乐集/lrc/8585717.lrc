[00:10.00]
[00:19.42]Can't you see I'm holding your flag
[00:24.06]The one that you left on the ground
[00:28.65]Well is the world too heavy for you
[00:33.05]If it makes you feel better, I'll carry it, too
[00:39.06]No one's gonna stand in your light
[00:44.13]Impressions are easy to fight
[00:48.59]But until you turn to me and say
[00:52.78]You don't need anyone to carry the weight, I will stay
[00:59.43]

[03:30.43][03:10.26][02:19.00][01:10.78]Abilene
[03:35.04][02:23.37][01:15.72]Isn't it good to be free
[01:19.97]
[01:28.03]Can't you see I'm earing your shirt
[01:32.57]The one with the heart on the sleeve
[01:37.56]Everyone can see you've been hurt
[01:41.61]But honey don't give up on me
[01:47.78]When you gonna make up your mind
[01:52.25]When you gonna get out of bed
[01:57.13]Well everyday you're gonna find
[02:01.13]Broken promises are no worse than words never said
[02:29.01][02:07.67]
[02:30.82]Then you want someone to come along and save the day
[02:37.95]Well you make it much too hard
[03:40.24][03:17.27][02:43.24]
