[00:17.68]Verse 1:
[00:18.74]I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high
[00:22.63]Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
[00:27.18]Now I see the world as a candy store
[00:31.11]With a cigarette smile, saying things you can't ignore
[00:36.06]Like mommy I love you
[00:38.27]Daddy I hate you
[00:40.38]Brother I need you
[00:42.72]Lover, hey, "fuck you"
[00:44.87]I can see everything here with my third eye
[00:49.02]Like the blue in the sky
[00:51.53]
[00:51.99]Chorus:
[00:52.23]If God is a DJ
[00:53.55]Life is a dance floor
[00:55.91]Love is the rhythm
[00:57.85]You are the music
[01:00.00]If God is a DJ
[01:02.08]Life is a dance floor
[01:04.36]You get what you're given
[01:06.30]its all how you use it
[01:08.38]
[01:11.21]Verse 2:
[01:17.34]I've been the girl - middle finger in the air
[01:22.52]Unaffected by rumors, the truth: i don't care
[01:27.07]So open your mouth and stick out your toungue
[01:31.35]You might as well let go you can't take back what you've done
[01:36.07]So find a new lifestyle
[01:38.18]A reason to smile
[01:40.52]Look for Nirvana
[01:42.70]Under the strobe lights
[01:45.54]Sequins and sex dreams
[01:47.31]You whisper to me
[01:49.78]there's no reason to cry
[02:01.16]
[02:04.00]Chorus
[02:08.35]
[02:09.71]Bridge
[02:10.14]You take what you get and you get what you give
[02:12.54]I say don't run from yourself, man, that's no way to live
[02:16.70]I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin
[02:21.35]Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin
[02:24.59]
[02:31.67]If God is a DJ...If God...
[02:46.52]If God is a DJ life is a dance floor so
[02:49.62]Get your ass on the dance floor now...
[02:51.48]
[02:54.20]Chorus x2
[02:55.85]
