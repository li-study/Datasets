[00:44.12]I'm sick and tired and lonely, sitting in my room
[00:54.56]Staring at the shadows, blowing smoke rings at the moon
[01:04.10]Every night I try, but, every night I cry, tryin' to work out why
[01:09.63]I just wanna know, got to know, why you keep on pushing me, baby
[01:17.26]
[01:26.32]You love me when you want, and take me when you need
[01:36.92]Whatever you say to me, baby, makes my poor heart bleed
[01:46.58]Now I don't wanna win, but, I don't wanna lose
[01:49.32]An' I don't wanna be alone no more, no more
[01:54.64]I just wanna give you love, I just got to give you love
[02:04.77]
[02:06.80]But, you keep on giving love
[02:09.90]You give another man your love
[02:14.42]Ooh baby, don't you leave me this way
[02:21.91]Don't you leave me
[02:24.07]
[02:30.15]I never wanna hurt you, don't wanna tie you down
[02:40.07]But, every time I take a look in the mirror
[02:46.54]I can see the heartache hangin' 'round
[02:51.65]I'm going down to the ground
[02:55.92]Why you always wanna bring me down
[03:00.71]Baby, baby, why do you always bring me down
[03:07.96]
[03:10.30]'Cos you keep on giving love
[03:13.60]You give another man your love
[03:17.82]Baby, baby, don't you leave me this way
[03:28.72]Don't you leave me, baby, baby, baby
[03:38.29]My heart is aching, my heart is breaking for you
[03:49.47]And I can't take it anymore, no more, no more
[03:55.89]
[05:41.03]I'm sick and tired and lonely, nothing left to say
[05:51.70]Just thinking 'bout you, baby, takes all my night and day
[06:01.88]All my nights, all my days
[06:13.54]Baby, babe, you take my breath away
[06:17.94]
[06:21.09]'Cos you keep on giving love
[06:24.33]You give another man your love
[06:28.45]Baby, baby, baby, don't you leave me this way
[06:34.65]
[06:39.45]I can't stop my love from falling down
[06:48.84]I wanna love you in the morning
[06:51.06]Wanna love you in the evening time
[06:59.37]Don't you leave me, baby
[07:01.53]Don't you ever leave me, baby
[07:04.20]
[07:20.92]Don't you leave me, baby, no
[07:25.58]
[07:33.67]Don't you leave me, baby
[07:37.93]
