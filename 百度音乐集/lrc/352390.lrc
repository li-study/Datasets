[03:32.85][00:04.55]Enya: On My Way Home
[00:16.28]I have been given
[00:20.50]one moment from heaven
[00:26.11]as I am walking
[00:30.57]surrounded by night,
[00:41.33]Stars high above me
[00:45.72]make a wish under moonlight.
[02:46.11][01:54.67][00:53.51]On my way home
[02:58.00][02:47.81][01:56.95][00:55.57]I remember only good days.
[02:55.59][02:04.27][01:03.29]On my way home
[02:06.89][01:05.53]I remember all the best days.
[02:14.56]I'm on my way home
[02:16.82]I can remember every new day.
[01:17.33]I move in silence
[01:21.57]with each step taken,
[01:27.09]snow falling round me
[01:31.55]like angels in flight,
[01:42.36]Far in the distance
[01:46.72]is my wish under moonlight.
