
[00:03.03]Long Live
[00:05.80]Taylor Swift
[00:08.58]
[00:16.75]I said remember this moment
[00:21.46]In the back of my mind
[00:26.07]The time we stood with our shaking hands
[00:30.53]crowds and stands went wild
[00:33.97]
[00:35.70]We were the Kings and the Queens
[00:40.50]And they read off our names
[00:44.95]The night you danced like you knew our lives
[00:49.11]Would never be the same
[00:52.73]
[00:54.51]You held your head like a hero
[00:59.19]On a history book page
[01:03.83]It was the end of a decade
[01:08.67]But the start of an age
[01:11.67]
[01:14.66]Long live the walls we crashed through
[01:18.48]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[01:22.82]I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[01:27.54]And bring on all the pretenders
[01:30.99]One day we will be remembered
[01:35.38]
[01:36.92]I said remember this feeling
[01:41.49]I passed the pictures around
[01:46.03]Of all the years that we stood there
[01:49.38]On the side-lines wishing for right now
[01:54.49]
[01:55.66]We are the Kings and the Queens
[01:59.33]You trade your basevall cap for a crown
[02:05.05]When they gave us our trophies
[02:08.54]And we help them up for our town
[02:14.50]And the cynics were outraged
[02:19.14]Screaming this is absurd
[02:23.78]Cause for a moment a band of theives
[02:28.06]In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[02:34.21]
[02:34.94]Long live the walls we crashed through
[02:38.44]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[02:42.89]I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[02:47.56]And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[02:52.50]
[02:53.56]Long live all the mountains we moved
[02:57.04]I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[03:01.90]I was screaming long live the look on your face
[03:06.59]And bring on all the pretenders
[03:09.80]One day we will be remembered
[03:14.22]
[03:17.69]Hold on to spinning around
[03:22.13]Confetti falls to the ground
[03:27.54]May these memories break our fall
[03:35.31]Will you take a moment
[03:39.95]Promise me this
[03:43.70]That you'll stand by my forever
[03:47.66]But if God forbid fate should step in
[03:51.55]
[03:53.32]And force us into a goodbye
[03:58.05]If you have children some day
[04:02.91]When they point to the pictures
[04:07.54]Please tell them my name
[04:12.50]Tell them how the crowds went wild
[04:17.50]Tell them how our hope it shined
[04:22.22]
[04:23.18]Long live the walls we crashed through
[04:26.84]I had the time of my life with you
[04:32.11]Long, long live the walls we crashed through
[04:36.13]How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[04:40.33]And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
[04:45.22]And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[04:50.56]Saying long live all the mountains we moved
[04:54.73]I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[04:59.82]And long, long live, the look on your face
[05:04.43]And bring on all the pretenders
[05:07.48]One day
[05:11.49]We will be remembered
[05:14.35]
