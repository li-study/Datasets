[00:01.25]Never Surrender
[00:19.94]Just a little more time is all we're asking for
[00:26.57]Cause just a little more time could open closing doors
[00:36.92]Just a little uncertainty can bring you down
[00:46.34]And nobody wants to know you now
[00:51.88]And nobody wants to show you how
[00:56.45]So if you're lost and on your own
[01:01.56]You can never surrender
[01:05.60]And if your path won't lead you home
[01:10.74]You can never surrender
[01:14.61]And when the night is cold and dark
[01:19.41]You can see, you can see light
[01:23.67]Cause no one can take away your right
[01:28.48]To fight and never surrender
[01:50.71]With a little perseverance you can get things done
[02:00.16]Without the blind adherence that has conquered some
[02:09.34]And nobody wants to know you now
[02:14.12]And nobody wants to show you how
[02:18.82]So if you're lost and on your own
[02:24.35]You can never surrender
[02:28.02]And if your path won't lead you home
[02:33.49]You can never surrender
[03:31.03][02:37.03]And when the night is cold and dark
[03:35.65][02:41.69]You can see, you can see light
[03:39.68][02:45.57]Cause no one can take away your right
[03:44.60][02:51.30]To fight and never surrender
[03:48.23][02:54.64]To never surrender
