[00:16.69]Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
[00:21.05]in the lane, snow is glistening
[00:24.63]A beautiful sight
[00:26.52]we're happy tonight,
[00:29.07]walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:32.60]Gone away is the bluebird
[00:36.28]here to stay is a new bird
[00:40.56]He sings a love song
[00:42.39]as we go along
[00:44.30]walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:48.25]In the meadow we can build a snowman
[00:51.95]Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
[00:55.76]He'll say: Are you married?
[00:57.45]we'll say: No man
[00:59.57]But you can do the job
[01:01.20]when you're in town.
[01:03.26]Later on, we'll conspire
[01:06.64]as we dream by the fire
[01:10.83]To face unafraid
[01:12.78]the plans that we've made
[01:14.76]walking in a winter wonderland.
[01:18.19]
[01:34.02]In the meadow we can build a snowman,
[01:37.79]And pretend that he's Charlie Brown
[01:41.62]We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
[01:45.49]Until all the other children knock him down.
[02:08.31][01:48.77]When it snows, ain't it thrilling
[02:12.06][01:52.54]Though your nose gets a chilling
[02:16.26][01:56.66]We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
[02:27.78][02:24.00][02:20.18][02:04.45][02:00.68]Walking in a winter wonderland.
