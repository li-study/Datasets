[00:22.07]
[00:24.07]I'm comin' 'round to open the blinds
[00:30.37]You can't hide here any longer
[00:36.19]My God you need to rinse those puffy eyes
[00:42.58]You can't last here any longer
[00:46.32]
[00:50.47]And yes they'll ask you where you've been
[00:56.14]And you'll have to tell them again and again
[01:00.80]And you probably don't want to hear
[01:04.56]tomorrow's another day
[01:07.48]Well I promise you you'll see the sun again
[01:13.25]And you're asking me
[01:15.15]why pain's the only way to happiness
[01:19.86]And I promise you you'll see the sun again
[01:24.18]
[01:26.96]Come on take my hand
[01:31.57]We're going for a walk, I know you can
[01:38.85]You can wear anything as long as it's not black
[01:45.26]Please don't mourn forever
[01:47.97]She's not coming back
[01:50.14]
[01:51.43]And yes they'll ask you where you've been
[01:57.40]And you'll have to tell them again and again
[02:02.20]And you probably don't want to hear

[02:21.11]And I promise you you'll see the sun again
[02:27.07]And I promise you you'll see the sun again
[02:31.53]
[02:34.06]Do you remember telling me
[02:37.64]you found the sweetest thing of all
[02:40.40]You said one day this was worth dying for
[02:45.09]So be thankful you knew her at all
[02:52.55]But it's no more
[02:55.04]
[03:21.84][02:57.53]And you probably don't want to hear
[03:24.30][03:00.87]tomorrow's another day
