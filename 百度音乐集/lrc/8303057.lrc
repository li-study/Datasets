
[00:01.00]Blue Monday
[00:03.57]New Order
[00:04.67]
[02:09.88]How does it feel
[02:12.74]To treat me like you do
[02:16.23]When you've laid your hands upon me
[02:19.97]And told me who you are
[02:23.85]I thought I was mistaken
[02:27.35]I thought I heard you speak
[02:31.38]Tell me how do I feel
[02:34.48]Tell me now how do I feel
[02:38.29]Those who came before me
[02:42.06]Lived through their vocations
[02:45.77]From the past until completion
[02:49.30]They will turn away no more
[02:52.95]And I still find it so hard
[02:56.87]To say what I need to say
[03:00.55]But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
[03:03.92]Just how I should feel today
[03:07.83]
[03:33.98]I see a ship in the harbor
[03:37.48]I can and shall obey
[03:40.93]But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
[03:44.58]I'd be a heavenly person today
[03:48.41]And I thought I was mistaken
[03:52.02]And I thought I heard you speak
[03:55.63]Tell me how do I feel
[03:58.95]Tell me now how should I feel
[04:02.98]Now I stand here waiting
[04:06.60]
[04:18.60]I thought I told you to leave me
[04:21.39]While I walked down to the beach
[04:25.35]Tell me how does it feel
[04:28.71]When your heart grows cold
[04:32.95]
