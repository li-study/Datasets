[00:00.00]Jennifer Lopez - Still
[00:17.79]
[00:19.79]When I sleep
[00:21.28]I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
[00:24.93]About the way you used to hold me
[00:27.51]And say nothin would ever harm me
[00:30.03]When we first met
[00:31.06]Oh how you charmed me
[00:32.37]Made me smile when I was down
[00:34.93]Big pimpin' around the town
[00:37.19]You and me
[00:37.98]Whenever they'd see you
[00:39.72]They'd see me
[00:40.37]A lover and a friend to me you were
[00:43.39]How did it end
[00:44.90]How it hurts
[00:45.91]To not have you in my life
[00:47.77]when I wanted to be your wife
[01:50.26][00:50.35]You never know what you have
[01:52.35][00:52.41]Till its gone
[01:53.49][00:53.63]Treated you wrong
[01:54.73][00:54.92]For so long
[01:56.09][00:56.23]Now you're gone away
[01:57.69][00:57.78]But the love still lives here
[01:00.25]Still...
[03:00.57][02:40.88][02:00.11][01:01.07]I still got love for you
[03:02.37][02:42.50][02:02.58][01:02.61]Still...
[03:03.15][02:43.25][02:03.38][01:03.42]After all we've been through
[03:04.92][02:45.01][02:04.97][01:05.11]Still...
[03:05.63][02:45.78][02:05.76][01:05.91]I gave my heart to you
[03:07.45][02:47.50][02:07.60][01:07.71]And baby you're the only one
[03:10.57][02:50.64][02:10.77][01:10.87]There's other men than you
[03:12.78][02:52.43][02:12.45][01:12.64]Still...
[03:13.23][02:53.18][02:13.25][01:13.35]They can come close to you
[03:14.81][02:54.90][02:15.00][01:15.11]Still..
[03:15.64][02:55.68][02:15.77][01:15.90]Once I said I love you
[03:17.40][02:57.64][02:17.60][01:17.71]I knew you'd be the only one
[01:20.52]A good man you were to me
[01:22.89]Always there to care
[01:24.85]Would do anything in this world for me
[01:27.72]Didn't matter, what, when, or where
[01:29.63]You were there
[01:30.27]I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
[01:34.81]When I just wanted to get some attention
[01:37.33]And I'm sorry baby for bitchin
[01:39.86]If I could take back the words
[01:42.37]That I said to make you leave
[01:44.83]I'd be down on bended knees
[01:47.09]Asking you to please forgive me
[02:21.22]
[02:21.78]All of the good times we had together (together)
[02:27.32]Do they mean something to you
[02:31.75]Do you ever wish we never split (never)
[02:37.94]Still got love for you...
