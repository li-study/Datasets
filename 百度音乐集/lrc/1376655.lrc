[00:15.48]When I was young, younger than before
[00:23.59]I never saw the truth hanging from the door
[00:32.87]And now I'm older see it face to face
[00:41.43]And now I'm older gotta get up clean the place.
[01:00.64]And I was green, greener than a hill
[01:09.23]Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
[01:17.85]Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
[01:26.46]Just hand me down, give me a place to be.
[01:55.79]And I was strong, strong in the sun
[02:03.87]I thought I'd see when day is done
[02:13.40]Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
[02:21.49]Oh, so weak in this need for you.
