[00:02.28]
[00:11.14]I tried to be perfect
[00:13.21]But nothing was worth it
[00:16.06]I don't believe it makes me real
[00:20.48]I'd thought it'd be easy
[00:22.89]But no on believes me
[00:25.74]I left all the things that I said
[00:29.87]
[00:30.04]If you believe it's in my soul
[00:35.50]I'd say all the words that I know
[00:40.01]Just to see if it would show
[00:45.02]But I tried to let you know
[00:49.88]That I'm better off on my own
[00:54.26]
[01:03.92]This place is so empty
[01:06.20]My thoughts are so tempting
[01:08.80]I don't know how it got so bad
[01:13.24]Sometimes it's so crazy that nothing could save me
[01:18.66]But it's the only thing that I have
[01:22.61]
[01:22.86]If you believe it's in my soul
[01:28.36]I'd say all the words that I know
[01:32.76]Just to see if it would show
[01:38.00]But I tried to let you know
[01:42.83]That I'm better off on my own
[01:47.13]
[01:54.89](On my own!)
[01:56.13]
[02:11.13]I tried to be perfect
[02:13.48]It just wasn't worth it
[02:16.00]Nothing could ever be so wrong
[02:20.53]It's hard to believe me
[02:23.00]It never gets easy
[02:26.03]I guess I knew that all along
[02:30.05]
[02:30.18]If you believe it's in my soul
[02:35.67]I'd say all the words that I know
[02:40.12]Just to see if it would show
