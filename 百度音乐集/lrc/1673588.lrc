[00:17.28][00:01.71]All of the boys and the girls here in Paris
[00:20.94][00:05.52]See to the night without sight but with madness
[00:24.81][00:09.64]I can’t keep up, I’m a wreck but I want it
[00:28.80][00:13.30]Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris
[03:13.74][02:41.42][02:10.28][01:38.98][01:23.10][01:04.57][00:32.29][00:16.86]
[02:58.30][02:43.03][01:55.96][01:40.53][00:49.59][00:32.79]My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning, Paris is burning all night long
[03:05.98][02:50.66][02:03.58][01:47.89][00:57.39][00:41.66]My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming, Paris is screaming all night long
[01:23.82][01:07.85]Kids in the street drinking wine on the sidewalk
[01:27.30][01:11.74]Saving the plans that we make ‘till it’s night time
[01:31.31][01:15.69]Give me your glass, it’s your last, you’re too wasted
[01:35.14][01:19.48]Give me one too, cos I’m new and need tasting
[03:21.27][03:14.43][02:18.30][02:11.18]I’ve lost my way it’s hard to find it through
[03:26.02][03:17.49][02:25.82][02:15.53]I see the night but lost all sight of you
