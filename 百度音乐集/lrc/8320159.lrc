[00:03.81]"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart"
[00:05.67]
[01:04.70]I am an American aquarium drinker
[01:10.70]I assassin down the avenue
[01:16.12]I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
[01:21.72]What was I thinking when I let go of you?
[01:26.15]
[01:38.34]Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
[01:44.00]Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
[01:49.49]This is not a joke, so please stop smiling
[01:55.29]What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?
[01:59.80]
[02:12.19]I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
[02:17.41]Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
[02:22.87]You were so right when you said that I've been drinking
[02:28.60]What was I thinking when I said good night?
[02:33.48]
[02:56.25]I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn
[03:01.76]You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
[03:07.27]Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns
[03:12.87]What was I thinking when I said hello?
[03:22.01]
[03:29.56]I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
[03:34.96]You'd always love me like you did back then
[03:40.20]Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
[03:46.02]What was I thinking when I let you back in?
[03:50.78]
[03:51.81]I am trying to break your heart
[03:57.35]I am trying to break your heart
[04:02.21]But still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
[04:08.08]I am trying to break your heart
[04:12.83]
[05:25.78]Disposable Dixie-cup drinking
[05:30.34]I assassin down the avenue
[05:35.94]I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
[05:41.60]What was I thinking when I let go of you?
[05:45.64]
[06:37.13]loves you
[06:41.15]I'm the man who loves you
