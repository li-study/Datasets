[00:08.45]Three little birds, sat on my window.
[00:13.29]And they told me I don't need to worry.
[00:18.88]Summer came like cinnamon
[00:21.46]So sweet,
[00:23.30]Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.
[00:28.69]Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, 
[00:34.87]but it's alright
[00:37.56]The more things seems to change, 
[00:42.83]the more they seem to stay the same.
[00:45.44]Oh, don't you hesitate.
[00:47.99]Girl, put your records on, 
[00:50.85]tell me your favourite song
[00:53.31]You go ahead, let your hair down
[00:57.98]Saphire and faded jeans, 
[01:00.91]I hope you get your dreams,
[01:03.20]Just go ahead, let your hair down.
[01:08.29]You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
[01:15.83]Blue as the sky, sombre and lonely,
[01:20.68]Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
[01:23.82](just relax, just relax)
[01:26.51]Don't you let those other boys fool you,
[01:30.77]Gotta love that afro hairdo.
[01:36.16]Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, 
[01:42.62]but it's alright
[01:45.09]The more things stay the same, 
[01:49.97]the more they seem to change.
[01:53.84]Don't you think it's strange?

[02:10.80]Just go ahead, let your hair down.
[02:15.86]You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
[02:20.96]Twas' more than I could take, 
[02:23.27]pity for pity's sake
[02:25.95]Some nights kept me awake, 
[02:28.19]I thought that I was stronger
[02:31.05]When you gonna realise, 
[02:33.29]that you don't even have to try any longer.
[02:38.36]Do what you want to.
