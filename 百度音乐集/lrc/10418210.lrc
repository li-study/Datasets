[00:03.41]Like A Rolling Stone
[00:04.75]Bob Dylan
[00:06.75]
[00:10.02]Once upon a time you dressed so fine
[00:13.98]Threw bums a dime in your prime,
[00:16.10]didn't you?
[00:21.75]People'd call say, Beware doll,
[00:23.22]You thought they were all kidding you
[00:23.56]you're bound to fall
[00:32.38]You used to laugh about
[00:34.89]Everybody that was hangin' out
[00:39.94]Now you don't talk so loud
[00:44.30]Now you don't seem so proud
[00:48.92]About having to be scrounging your next meal
[00:57.93]How does it feel, how does it feel?
[01:06.54]To be  without a home
[01:13.06]Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
[01:20.36]
[01:33.48]You've gone to the finest schools,
[01:35.04]but you know you only used to
[01:35.59]alright miss lonely
[01:37.58]get juiced in it
[01:42.14]Nobody's ever taught you
[01:44.39]how to live out on the street
[01:46.99]And now you're gonna have to get used to it
[01:54.32]You say you never compromise
[01:56.86]With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
[02:04.49]He's not selling any alibies
[02:07.49]As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
[02:13.94]And say do you want to make a deal
[02:19.75]
[02:21.76]How does it feel, how does it feel
[02:30.64]To be on your own,With no direction  home
[02:39.28]a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
[02:50.23]
[03:01.03]Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
[03:05.15]On the jumpers and the clowns
[03:06.58]when they did their tricks for you
[03:12.20]You never understood that it ain't no good
[03:14.54]You shouldn't let other people
[03:16.50]get your kicks for you
[03:22.60]You used to ride on your chrome horse
[03:27.69]Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
[03:32.86]Ain't it hard when you discovered that
[03:37.78]He really wasn't where it's at
[03:42.38]After he took from you
[03:45.12]everything he could steal
[03:50.67]
[03:51.08]How does it feel, how does it feel?
[04:01.52]To be on your own, With no direction  home
[04:10.47]Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
[04:18.15]
[04:30.54]Princess on a steeple
[04:32.03]and all the pretty people
[04:33.71]They're all drinking,
[04:35.05]thinking that they've got it made
[04:40.49]Exchanging all precious gifts
[04:43.05]You better take your diamond ring,
[04:45.53]you better pawn it babe
[04:51.02]You used to be so amused
[04:55.62]At Napoleon in rags
[04:58.08]and the language that he used
[05:00.69]Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
[05:05.57]When you ain't got nothing,
[05:07.37]you got nothing to loose
[05:10.86]You're invisible now,
[05:12.57]you've got not secret to conceal
[05:18.61]
[05:19.74]How does it feel, how does it feel?
[05:27.42]To be on your own, With no direction  home
[05:37.09]Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
[05:44.84]
