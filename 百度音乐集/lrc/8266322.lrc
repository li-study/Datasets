[00:14.16]I’m finding it hard,hard to take mistakes we have made.
[00:26.15]Ignoring the ones that we hold dear are the selfishness.
[00:37.26]All these things distract our eyes and still on tight
[00:49.80]Why,do u keep finding,saying everything’s alright?
[01:02.11]We all see the same things
[01:07.79]Why can’t we stand side by side?
[01:13.73]If we love eachother we can change the world
[01:34.40]How learning to sake the smaller steps and making away
[01:46.23]Can u take anymore?
[01:53.78]Can u stand by while all were pressures done?
[01:58.32]Be the spark for sake of the pride and set things right
[02:10.33]Why,do u keep finding,saying everything’s alright?
[02:22.52]We all see the same things
[02:27.18]Why can’t we stand side by side?
[02:34.77]If we love eachother we can change the world
