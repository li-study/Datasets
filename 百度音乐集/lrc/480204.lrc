[00:01.85]Christmas From The Heart
[00:03.73]
[00:04.60]Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
[00:13.96]Born is the King of Israel
[00:21.83]The first Noel, the angel did say
[00:30.55]Was to certain poor shepherds
[00:35.07]In fields as they lay
[00:39.14]In fields where they
[00:43.47]Lay keeping their sheep
[00:47.87]On a cold winter's night
[00:52.15]That was so deep
[00:56.51]Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
[01:05.79]Born is the King of Israel
[01:13.81]They looked up
[01:18.10]And saw a star
[01:22.46]Shining in the the East
[01:26.86]Beyond them far
[01:31.07]And to the earth it
[01:35.55]It gave great light
[01:39.72]And so it continued
[01:44.65]Both day and night
[01:48.44]Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
[01:57.62]Born is the King of Israel.
[02:06.36]And by the light of that same star,
[02:14.33]Three wise men came
[02:18.49]From country far;
[02:22.92]To seek for a King
[02:27.18]Was their intent,
[02:31.70]And to follow the star wherever it went.
[02:40.59]Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
[02:49.47]Born is the King of Israel.
[02:57.33]Born is the King of Israel.
