[00:01.16]Lifehouse - Wrecking Ball
[00:06.03]
[00:16.20]I'm alone,
[00:18.66]Wandering in your space
[00:23.56]Waiting for a sign of life
[00:26.37]Looking so out of place
[00:31.40]Then you whisper to me,
[00:34.41]It doesn't matter what you say
[00:39.47]I feel the weight against the wind
[00:43.76]The demolition of me caving in
[00:49.79]
[00:51.90]And I'm always swinging on this wrecking ball
[00:59.50]While you're building up and breaking down my wall
[01:07.24]You push and pull, you give and take
[01:11.29]And thru it all I gravitate to you
[01:16.44]
[01:23.00]I'm a fool,
[01:25.25]A mechanical tool for you
[01:30.18]You've got all the switches and
[01:33.47]Levers to blow my cool
[01:38.21]And when you know I'm broken
[01:41.43]That's when you come shining thru
[01:46.31]You set me up to knock me down
[01:50.65]And leave my shattered pieces on the ground
[01:56.16]
[01:58.61]And I'm always swinging on this wrecking ball
[02:06.21]While you're building up and breaking down my wall
[02:14.10]You push and pull, you give and take
[02:18.10]And thru it all I gravitate to you
[02:23.37]
[03:09.10]You set me up to knock me down
[03:13.24]And leave my shattered pieces on the ground
[03:18.84]
[03:21.13]And I'm always swinging on this wrecking ball
[03:28.92]While you're building up and breaking down my wall
[03:36.80]You push and pull, you give and take
[03:40.76]And thru it all I gravitate to you
[03:46.09]
