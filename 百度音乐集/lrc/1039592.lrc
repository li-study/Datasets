[00:05.96]Christina Aguilera
[00:08.77]
[00:10.42]Look at me
[00:13.00]You may think you see
[00:15.00]who I really am
[00:18.00]But you'll never know me
[00:21.00]Every day
[00:23.00]It's as if I play a part
[00:28.00]Now I see
[00:30.00]If I wear a mask
[00:33.00]I can fool the world
[00:35.00]But I cannot fool
[00:38.00]my heart
[00:43.00]Who is that girl I see
[00:48.50]Staring straight back at me?
[00:53.00]When will my reflection show
[00:58.50]who I am inside?
[01:06.00]I am now in a world
[01:09.00]where I have to
[01:11.00]hide my heart
[01:13.00]And what I believe in
[01:16.00]But somehow
[01:18.00]I will show the world
[01:20.00]what's inside my heart
[01:23.00]And be loved for who I am
[01:27.34]
[01:31.00]Who is that girl I see
[01:36.00]staring straight back at me?
[01:40.50]Why is my reflection
[01:45.00]someone I don't know?
[01:50.50]Must I pretend that I'm
[01:56.00]someone else for all time?
[02:01.00]When will my reflection show
[02:06.00]who I am inside?
[02:10.00]There's a heart that must
[02:13.00]be free to fly
[02:18.00]That burns with a need
[02:22.00]to know the reason why
[02:28.50]Why must we all conceal
[02:34.00]What we think
[02:36.00]How we feel?
[02:38.00]Must there be a secret me
[02:43.00]I'm forced to hide?
[02:48.00]I won't pretend that I'm
[02:53.00]someone else
[02:56.00]For all time
[02:58.50]When will my reflection show
[03:04.00]who I am inside?
[03:11.00]When will my reflection show
[03:17.00]who I am inside?
[03:21.25]
