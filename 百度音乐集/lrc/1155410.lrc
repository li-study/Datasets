[00:00.55][00:00.95][03:22.82][03:27.95]
[00:01.11][03:09.68]Everyone knows that I'm ten feet under
[00:07.14]Till you come along and brighten my day
[00:13.63]Everyone knows that you kill the thunder
[00:19.73]The worry in my brain
[00:22.88]You've given me the strength
[00:26.05]To see you right through the haze
[00:32.37][01:29.08][02:13.01]Shine, come on and let it shine
[00:35.64][01:32.14][02:16.33]Light me up, make me feel alive
[00:38.78][01:35.27][02:19.42]You've got what it takes
[00:45.04][01:41.48][02:25.56]Shine, and only you know how to lift my spirit off the ground
[00:51.20][01:47.81][02:31.87]And chase those clouds away
[00:55.98][02:57.12]Shine on me today
[01:03.86]When everything's wrong
[01:06.31]I just pick the phone up
[01:10.01]The sun in your voice really fills my eyes with tears of joy
[01:18.86]Cause I know you'll be there
[01:22.39]When I'm hanging by a thread
[01:25.75]You're my heaven sent
[01:53.70]Oh you have this way of making me feel like I can fly
[01:59.68]You're underneath my wings
[02:01.85]So I'll free fall out of the sky
[02:05.84]You're always there to save me
[02:09.37]You know you'll save me
[02:37.55]Come on and shine
[02:42.13]Shine
[02:44.61][02:47.54][02:49.14]Shine on me
[03:15.74]Till you come along and brighten my world
