[00:27.05]For the record
[00:29.62]You oughta know
[00:31.29]You wasn't thinking
[00:32.61]When you let me go
[00:33.47]
[00:33.93]But whatever
[00:35.73]That's how it goes
[00:37.43]Win some you lose some
[00:38.84]And others you hold in your heart
[00:40.66]
[00:41.05]Why it gets so hard
[00:42.78]Tears you all apart
[00:44.54]Even though you try to let go
[00:46.27]No, no, no
[00:47.00]
[00:47.36]Suddenly you're here
[00:49.02]And it's so surreal
[00:51.19]And I don't know
[00:52.09]What the deal
[00:52.15]
[00:52.53]Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
[00:55.42]Feels like the first time
[00:58.77]Give me one good reason why
[01:02.08]We can't just press rewind
[01:05.18]I don't wanna spend my life
[01:07.25]Thinking what it could've been like
[01:08.75]If we had another try (one time)
[01:11.31]Like back in the day
[01:12.87]That look on your face
[01:14.55]Feels like, the first time
[01:17.15]
[01:17.48]Them other irregularities
[01:20.81]They can't compete with MC
[01:23.54]The whole entire world can tell
[01:26.88]That you love yourself some me
[01:29.31]
[01:29.89]People see ya know
[01:31.18]Asking all about
[01:32.99]Me and how they always thought we
[01:34.88]Were so perfect together
[01:36.13]
[01:37.58]Let's re-write the end
[01:38.93]Start over again
[01:41.14]And it's gon go better now
[01:42.26]
[01:42.49]Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
[01:45.12]Feels like the first time
[01:48.64]Give me one good reason why
[01:51.47]We can't just press rewind
[01:54.68]I don't wanna spend my life
[01:56.54]Thinking what it could've been like
[01:58.40]If we had another try (one time)
[02:00.99]Like back in the day
[02:02.60]That look on your face
[02:04.28]Feels like, the first time
[02:06.30]
[02:07.39]For the record
[02:09.03]You'll always be a part of me
[02:11.55]No matter what you do
[02:13.54]And for the record
[02:15.42]Can't nobody say
[02:17.29]I didn't give my all to you
[02:19.96]
[02:20.28]And for the record
[02:22.48]I told you underneath the stars
[02:24.83]That you belong to me
[02:26.71]For the record
[02:28.34]It's obvious that
[02:30.11]We just can't let go of us, honey
[02:32.74]
[02:33.18]Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
[02:35.97]Feels like the first time

[03:07.02]We can't just press rewind
[03:10.22]I don't wanna spend my life
[03:12.31]Thinking what it could've been like
[03:13.90]If we had another try (one time)
[03:16.54]Like back in the day
[03:18.21]That look on your face
[03:19.78]Feels like, the first time
