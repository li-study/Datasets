[00:-3.00]
[00:-1.00]

[00:00.81]She is a pyramid
[00:04.98]But with him, she's just a grain of sand
[00:09.73]This love's too strong
[00:11.65]Like mice and men
[00:13.47]Squeezing out the life that should be let in
[00:17.00]
[00:17.41]She was a hurricane
[00:21.60]But now she's just a gust of wind
[00:25.60]She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
[00:29.96]Was a force to be reckoned with
[00:35.54]
[00:35.96]She could be a Statue of Liberty
[00:40.12]She could be a Joan of Arc
[00:44.09]But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
[00:47.88]So he keeps her in the dark
[00:51.91]
[00:52.48]Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
[01:00.16]Oh, she used to rule the world, oh
[01:08.47]Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
[01:17.01]'Cause she used to be a pearl
[01:22.21]
[01:23.68]She was unstoppable
[01:27.72]Move fast just like an avalanche
[01:32.19]But now she's stuck deep in cement
[01:36.29]Wishing that they never, ever met
[01:40.41]
[01:42.01]She could be a Statue of Liberty
[01:46.13]She could be a Joan of Arc
[01:50.23]But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
[01:54.72]So he keeps her in the dark
[01:58.09]
[01:58.44]Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
[02:06.27]Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
[02:14.42]Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
[02:22.99]'Cause she used to be a
[02:26.66]
[02:26.98]Do you know that there's a way out, there's a way out
[02:31.50]There's a way out, there's a way out?
[02:34.90]You don't have to be held down, be held down
[02:39.78]Be held down, be held down
[02:43.63]
[02:45.77]'Cause I used to be a shell
[02:53.23]Yeah, I let him rule my world
[02:58.81]My world, oh yeah
[03:02.04]But I woke up and grew strong
[03:07.21]And I can still go on
[03:10.61]And no one can take my pearl
[03:18.28]
[03:19.10]You don't have to be a shell, no
[03:26.96]You're the one that rules your world, oh
[03:35.19]You are strong and you'll learn
[03:40.06]That you can still go on
[03:43.70]And you'll always be a, a pearl
[03:50.54]
[03:56.77]She is unstoppable
[04:00.67]
