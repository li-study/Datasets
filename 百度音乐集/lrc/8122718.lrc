[00:03.66]- Engebert Humperdinck
[00:07.06]
[00:08.38]I can't believe
[00:09.83]that I'm feeling this way about you
[00:16.72]I'm so confused
[00:18.44]that all of my thoughts surround you
[00:24.87]Guess there's just nothing to do
[00:28.88]But spend my whole life loving you
[00:32.53]Oh, I'm falling,
[00:35.69]catch me, I'm falling in love with you
[00:42.98]
[00:49.80]You hypnotising,
[00:51.05]your eyes mesmerise everything I do
[00:57.89]Now that you're near,
[00:59.82]I'll always fear living without you
[01:06.14]I don't have any doubt
[01:10.24]You are what I'm all about
[01:14.23]I'm falling,
[01:16.96]catch me, I'm falling in love with you
[01:24.08]
[01:26.56]All of the signs point one way
[01:30.80]Leaves me with one thing to say
[01:34.00]
[01:38.74]My head's in the clouds
[01:41.09]and I'm singing out loud about you
[01:46.89]To tell you the truth,
[01:48.70]I'll find any excuse to be near you
[01:55.38]Maybe tomorrow you'll see
[01:59.33]You'll spend your whole life loving me
[02:02.77]I'm falling,
[02:06.30]catch me, I'm falling in love with you
[02:15.08]Catch me, I'm falling in love with you
[02:23.04]Catch me, I'm falling in love with you
[02:31.05]
