[00:03.05]There For You
[00:04.34]By smallyiuyiu
[00:08.52]Sometimes I\'m a selfish fake.
[00:13.63]You\'re always a true friend.
[00:17.45]I don\'t deserve you cause I\'m not there for you.
[00:21.88]Please forgive me again...
[00:28.78]I want to be there for you...
[00:33.18]Someone you can come to...
[00:37.85]It runs deeper than my bones...
[00:43.55]I want to be there for you.
[00:51.34]Swirling shades of blue
[00:55.77]slow dancing in your sky,
[01:00.32]The sun kisses the earth
[01:04.37]and I hush my urge to cry.
[01:11.86]I want to be there for you...
[01:16.12]Someone you can come to...
[01:20.81]It runs deeper than my bones...
[01:25.17]I want to be there for you.
[01:31.96]Cause I hear the whispered words
[01:35.91]in your masterpiece, beautiful...
[01:40.83]You speak the unspeakable through...
[01:47.79]I love you too.
[01:59.02]I want to be there for you
[02:03.49]And be someone you can come to
[02:09.06]I want to be there for you
[02:27.52]The love runs deeper than my bones
[02:33.77]And I want to be there for you
