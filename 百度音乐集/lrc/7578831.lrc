[00:00.73]Where do I put this fire
[00:04.08]This bright red feeling
[00:07.84]This tiger lily down my mouth
[00:11.97]He wants to grow to twenty feet tall
[00:19.06]
[00:19.99]CHORUS:
[00:20.62]
[00:21.25]I've left bethlehem
[00:23.41]I feel free
[00:26.08]I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
[00:32.96]Someday I'll be born
[00:39.12]
[00:41.80]I'm so tired of being shy
[00:47.75]I'm not that girl anymore
[00:49.65]I'm not that straight A anymore
[00:52.44]Now I want to sit with my legs wide open and
[00:55.48]Laugh so loud that the whole damn restaurant
[00:57.82]Will turn and look at me and say
[01:02.68]Look at the tiger jumping out of her mouth
[01:04.29]Chorus
[01:05.05]I've left bethlehem
[01:06.90]I feel free
[01:09.49]I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
[01:16.56]Someday I'll be born
[01:26.14]No more sex-starved teachers
[01:31.61]Trying to touch my ass
[01:32.54]I can finally be a teenager at age twenty-six
[01:37.12]Go to hell lions, tigers, and bears
[01:40.15]I'm not afraid of you anymore
[01:44.59]And my fear broke apart like fifty balloons
[01:47.13]And I'm thrown around the room like party confetti now
[01:50.59]
[01:51.17]chorus
[01:51.57]I've left bethlehem
[01:53.51]I feel free
[01:55.74]I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
[02:03.02]Someday I'll be born
[02:13.11]Someday I'll be born
[02:28.24]Someday someday someday I'll be born
[02:48.37]Someday someday someday I'll be born
[03:02.11]High and noon (13 times)
[03:42.09]
