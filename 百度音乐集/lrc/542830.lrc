[00:07.00]hey now - Oasis
[00:09.00]Album:（What′s The Story） Morning Glory
[00:21.00]I hitched a ride with my soul
[00:25.00]By the side of the road
[00:27.00]Just as the sky turned black
[00:31.00]I took a walk with my fame
[00:33.00]Down memory lane
[00:36.00]I never did find my way back
[00:40.00]You know that I gotta say time′s slipping away
[00:45.00]And what will it hold for me
[00:49.00]What am I gonna do while I′m looking at you
[00:55.00]You′re standing ignoring me
[01:00.00]I thought that I heard someone say now
[01:06.00]There′s no time for running away now
[01:11.00]Hey now! Hey now!
[01:18.00]Feel no shame - cos time′s no chain
[01:27.00]Feel no shame
[01:35.00]The first thing I saw
[01:37.00]As I walked through the door
[01:40.00]Was a sign on the wall that read
[01:44.00]It said you might never know
[01:47.00]That I want you to know
[01:49.00]What is written inside of your head
[01:54.00]And time as it stands
[01:56.00]Won′t be held in my hands
[01:59.00]Or living inside of my skin
[02:03.00]And as it fell from the sky
[02:06.00]I asked myself why
[02:08.00]Can I never let anyone in ?
[02:14.00]I thought that I heard someone say now
[02:19.00]There′s no time for running away now
[02:25.00]Hey now! Hey now!
[02:31.00]Feel no shame - cos time′s no chain
[02:40.00]Feel no shame
