[00:01.88]'So Beautiful'
[00:02.19]
[00:02.89]Whether I'm right or wrong
[00:06.57]There's no phrase that hits
[00:13.60]Like an ocean needs the sand
[00:17.81]Or a dirty old shoe that fits
[00:23.72]And if all the world was perfect
[00:26.47]I would only ever want to see your scars
[00:34.91]You know they can have their universe
[00:38.34]We'll be in the dirt designing stars
[00:44.21]
[00:45.34]And darlin' you know
[00:48.20]You make me feel so beautiful
[00:55.70]Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
[00:59.56]You make me feel so beautiful
[01:06.20]
[01:06.51]Whether I'm up or down
[01:14.39]There's no crowd to please
[01:21.85]I'm like a faith without a clause to believe in it
[01:31.42]And if all the world was smiling
[01:34.19]I would only ever want to see your frown
[01:42.62]You know they can sail away in sunsets
[01:45.97]We'll be right here stranded on the ground
[01:53.01]Just happy to be found
[01:55.35]
[01:55.96]You make me feel so beautiful
[02:03.53]Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
[02:07.24]You make me feel so beautiful
[02:13.61]
[02:14.26]I have lost my illusions
[02:19.31]I have drowned in your words
[02:22.11]I have left my confusion to a cynical world
[02:27.80]I am throwing myself at things I don't understand
[02:33.39]Discover enlightenment holding your hand
[02:38.94]
[02:39.32]You are..
[02:44.09]So Beautiful
[02:48.34]
[02:49.39]Yeah darlin' you know!
[02:52.28]That you make me feel so beautiful
[03:01.34]
