[00:03.73]Maroon 5
[00:13.99]
[00:19.17]Now as the summer fades
[00:21.44]I let you slip away
[00:23.66]You say I’m not your type
[00:25.41]But I can make you sway
[00:28.07]It makes you burn to learn
[00:30.03]You’re not the only one
[00:32.72]I\'d let you be if you
[00:34.37]put down your blazing gun
[00:36.30]Now you’ve gone somewhere else far away
[00:39.60]I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
[00:45.26]But you feel my breath
[00:47.60]On your neck
[00:48.66]Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
[00:54.29]‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
[00:58.68]And I feel a little better than I did before
[01:03.26]And if I never see your face again I don’t mind
[01:07.90]‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
[01:15.14]
[01:17.91]Sometimes you move so well
[01:19.51]It’s hard not to give in
[01:22.28]I’m lost, I can’t tell
[01:24.01]Where you end and I begin
[01:26.95]It makes me burn to learn
[01:30.35]You’re with another man
[01:31.51]I wonder if he’s half
[01:33.28]The lover that I am
[01:35.10]Now you’ve gone somewhere else Far away
[01:38.43]I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you)
[01:44.13]But you feel my breath On your neck
[01:47.49]Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you)
[01:52.93]‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
[01:57.52]And I feel a little better than I did before
[02:02.11]And if I never see your face again
[02:04.92]I don’t mind
[02:06.76]‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
[02:12.76]
[02:14.66]Baby, baby
[02:15.43]Please believe me
[02:16.37]Find it in your heart to reach me
[02:18.52]Promise not to leave me behind
[02:21.28](Promise not to leave me behind)
[02:23.06]
[02:23.36]Take me down, but take it easy
[02:25.38]Make me think but don’t deceive me
[02:27.62]Talk to me bout taking your time
[02:29.88](Talk to me, talk to me)
[02:32.11]‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
[02:36.16]And I feel a little better than I did before
[02:40.69]And if I never see your face again
[02:43.21]I don’t mind
[02:45.22]‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we\'d get tonight
[02:50.65]‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
[02:54.25]And I feel a little better than I did before
[02:58.77]And if I never see your face again
[03:01.60]I don’t mind
