[00:13.60]We use to pull off highway 249
[00:17.41]Had a cool little place where we'd go hide on a Friday night
[00:22.86]And get away from the city lights
[00:25.71]We'd find a little wood and build a fire
[00:30.49]Sonebody'd always bring a couple guitars
[00:33.84]And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
[00:38.65]We'd do "Ramblin' Man", "Proud Mary". and "American Band"
[00:47.09]We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs
[00:51.71]
[00:52.15]It was always the love songs every time
[00:56.09]Made everybody feel something inside
[00:58.90]With the fire down low held your girl real close
[01:05.43]Made you wanna love the one you wre with
[01:08.74]Gave you the courage of that first kiss
[01:11.87]It was the love songs always the love songs
[01:19.58]
[01:20.64]There was always a line stuck in your head
[01:24.78]That was said in a way you wished you could've said
[01:28.07]But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
[01:33.39]It felt so good those times you had
[01:37.70]That feelin' of wanting sombody so bad
[01:40.83]Made you weak in the heart you couldn't take being apart
[01:45.83]Honky tonk drinkin' songs we could do 'em all night long
[01:54.08]But the ones i remember the most
[01:58.51]
[01:58.89]You was always the love songs every time
[02:03.14]Made everybody feel something inside
[02:06.45]With the fire down low held your girl real close
[02:12.65]Made you wanna love the one you wre with
[02:16.09]Gave you the courage of that first kiss
[02:19.09]It was the love songs always the love songs
[02:26.03]
[02:35.18]We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs
[02:40.69]
[02:41.62]You was always the love songs every time
[02:44.81]Made everybody feel something inside
[02:47.87]With the fire down low held your girl real close
[02:54.06]Made you wanna love the one you wre with
[02:57.56]Gave you the courage of that first kiss
