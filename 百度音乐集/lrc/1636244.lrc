[00:20.79]There are things
[00:22.52]I can't tell you
[00:25.31]I love you too much to say
[00:30.69]I stand undressed

[01:41.19][00:39.78]Understand that it is hard to tell you
[01:44.33][00:43.00]That I've given all I have to give
[01:51.31][00:49.77]And I can understand your feelings
[01:54.70][00:52.60]But then everybody has a life to live
[03:44.07][03:23.79][03:03.28][02:22.63][02:01.76][01:00.18]Once in a lifetime

[02:42.66]I just need to have your love
[02:45.25]I just can't say no
