[00:00.00]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[00:06.68]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[00:11.94]I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
[00:15.30]And I feel that I must confess
[00:18.44]Even though it kills me to have to say
[00:21.50]I'll admit that I was impressed
[00:24.22]I guess I'd call it show of affection
[00:27.37]Gotta commend you on your selection
[00:30.32]Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
[00:33.17]In the back of my mind I can't help but question
[00:36.71]
[00:37.29]Does she rub your feet
[00:38.88]When you've had a long day
[00:40.31]And scratch your scalp
[00:41.73]When you take out your braids
[00:43.55]Does she know you like to play PS2
[00:46.35]'Til 6 in the morning like I do
[00:49.85]I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
[00:52.90]I think about it everyday
[00:55.94]And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
[00:59.05]It gets so hard to walk away
[01:02.32]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[01:08.36]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[01:11.82]I can't forget how we used to be
[01:14.39]I guess I have to live my life from day to day
[01:16.69]Hoping maybe you'll come back
[01:19.44]I know I tell myself not to be afraid to move on
[01:22.92]But it seems I can't
[01:25.51]Though my new man is giving me attention
[01:29.16]But it ain't the same as your affection
[01:31.84]I know that I should be content
[01:34.66]In the back of my mind I can't help but question
[01:38.49]Does he kiss me on my forehead
[01:40.56]Before we lay
[01:41.34]Show up on my doorstep
[01:43.50]With a bouquet
[01:44.46]Does he feel me in the middle of the day
[01:46.73]Just to say baby I love you like you used to
[01:51.03]I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain) (yeah)
[01:54.45]I think about it everyday (everyday)
[01:57.50]And even though we've moved on (moved on) (uh huh)
[02:00.55]It gets so hard to walk away
[02:03.69]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[02:09.98]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[02:13.82]I can't forget how we used to be
[02:16.01]So how do I express this feeling
[02:19.40]'Cause nobody compares to you
[02:22.17]And you know that she'll never love you like I do
[02:29.06](Yeah) I can't explain this feeling (uh huh)
[02:31.22]I think about it everyday (everyday) (yeah)
[02:34.36]And even though we've moved on (yeah)
[02:37.53]It gets so hard to walk away
[02:40.50]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[02:47.40]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[02:52.07]I can't forget how we used to be
[02:53.23]I can't explain this feeling
[02:55.99]I think about it everyday (everyday)
[02:59.04]And even though we've moved on (moved on)
[03:02.13]It gets so hard to walk away
[03:05.23]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[03:13.38]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[03:17.64]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
[03:23.54]I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
